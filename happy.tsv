textI misread a due date for a lab and thought it was due on Saturday (June 6) but it‚Äôs not actually due until July 6th so I don‚Äôt have to be super stressed out about it :)
"My oriole family in my yard wrecked my feeder because it was empty.  It made me happy to know that I can help animals in some small way. It made me laugh to know
 that they were all, ""Hey,  where's the food at, Lady!?""


Edit- wow! Thanks for the award! :)"
"My boss told me I‚Äôm doing a good job. 

I underestimated how powerful yet scarce, encouragement and praise can be."
A student wrote a paragraph on our online class about how much she enjoyed my class and how much fun I made it. Made my week.
My test results came back negative for Coronavirus after being sick for the past 5 days. I'm still really sick and I was pretty nervous since I got tested but I'm happy it's not that!
The sun rays piercing through the morning clouds. It always puts a smile on my face seeing how beautiful it is.
I'm happy that I have more money in my savings account alone than I had in my checking and savings combined a year ago. Money doesn't mean happiness, but the sense of relief and security is making me happy.
"Went grocery shopping and the guy behind me at the counter wore a shirt from my favourite band. Idk why, but it made my day.

Edit: for the guys asking about the Band - it was Sabaton"
"It's my birthday today. I got lots of texts from friends and family :) but really my mom texted me telling me my age (x) and said "" x years of sunshine in my life. Love you"" I don't deserve such lovely parents."
"Got rejected from a job (they want more experienced people) but the co-owner of the company said my resume was very good. This is stimulating for me :)

Edit: Thank you for all the kind responses! It really made my day!"
"My kitty climbed in bed with me this morning, flopped down, curled up next to me, and started purring.

Mom is doing better after complete kidney failure. Got called to apply for a supervisor position. Got a interview at another compay
Visited a 10 month old baby I removed from her parents 2 months ago. She used to be wide eyed, hyper alert and constantly crying and seeking reassurance. She's now a smiling, confident, comical baby with warm, brown eyes who is thriving on the love, care and attention from her new carers. Sometimes my job is actually  worthwhile.
"I fully shaved my head for the first time in my life. Wife was against the idea but I wanted to do it for so long and there is no better time to do it than now.

I did it and after I showered, my wife looks at me with lust. Thinks I look real sexy"
"My daughter told me she loved me, and that I'm her best friend; she's 3, (almost 4), years old.
I suffer from (possible bipolar) depression, and anxiety, so this made my heart swell. I don't know what I ever did to deserve such a precious child. Just typing this is making me tear up a little, lol. üòÖ"
"My dad got a job as a warehouse manager that he needed so he doesn‚Äôt need to work 2 jobs and he can see me and my family more 

Edit: Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being that guy but to whoever awarded my comment. I have been on Reddit for technically over a year ( had to make a new account) and made as much good content as I could being a 15 year old kid. To whoever awarded me you just made my day even better. Thank you"
"I just woke up, so I haven't been up for long.

That being said I saw my wife walking around before she knew I was up. She was wearing a T-shirt and underwear. She was listening to a podcast and smiling. The sun was in her hair. It was a very nice sight"
I read this question, and it made me happy that op is trying to make people happy by making them think of something that made them happy today.
Had a good talk with my boss regarding job security and such. Found out our company is fine and my job is fine. Lots of stress gone.
"Told my boss to sell all of my vacation time except one week.

Turns out I had 1040 hrs saved up. Should be getting something like $15000 this Friday.

Edit; there are too many to reply to now but for people wondering, I work a job that puts me on the road for ten months per year. I am single without kids, and I like my job, and being out on the road. So my time builds up rather quickly. I usually take one week off, and I get a few days off for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I really should take more vacation, though."
I‚Äôm getting a kitten!! I‚Äôve wanted one for so long, and I‚Äôm finally getting one with my boyfriend. Currently sitting in the car waiting for him to lock the front door to our apartment so we can head over to petco to buy the essentials and then a mini road trip to pick up our kitten.
My two year old daughter is learning to play Pokemon Go with me. (From home) she is making her gamer dad smile.
Placed about 500 pounds of studs on a 2nd floor patio around 30' away from myself and not only did the patio not collapse I didn't fuck anything up.
"It's my second day back after 14 months of maternity leave, the final three in lockdown. When I came downstairs after a bit of a tough day, my baby girl ran to me and threw herself at me for hugs and cuddles, with the most beautiful laughter I've ever heard, she was just so HAPPY to see me. Lifted my heart to heaven.

I imagine this is what it must be like to own a dog."
Attorney touched base with me to get all the paperwork in order on the house I'm closing on next Tuesday. First time homeowner!
My long time patient passed away at age 89 during heart valve replacement surgery. I of all people understand that these things happen but was still feeling pretty sad about it. This morning I received a gift (flowers, card, cookies, etc) from her family saying how I was always her favorite doc and she always felt cared for every time she would visit for an appointment. That really made my day.
My dog brought me her toy to play! She's 15 and spends most of the day sleeping now, so seeing her run around excited made me so happy!
I was able to eat a 32cm pizza despite my eating disorder telling me not to, because I am not allowed to gain weight.
I have a cat who‚Äôs really aggressive and territorial. Right now though, he‚Äôs cuddled in front of my laptop as an attempt to get pets from me. It‚Äôs really cute
I got coffee at a spot I used to go to with my dad. He's been gone 10 years but I still miss him. It had been a while since I'd been because I'm not usually on that side of town. It was a coincidence but it was nice to think of him again.
I saw a grandmother being goofy with her grandson in the park. For someone who‚Äôs never had a good relationship with their grandma, I was a bit jealous, but it made me really happy to see some people share such a pure bond.
I went for a 3mile walk with my dog.  I could not do this last week because my knees are so bad.  I got a cortisone shot and now I can take my buddy for long walks.
"I skate on my lunch breaks and have been trying to land a trick I haven't landed in a while, the 360 flip.  Before I went to skate, my girlfriend texted me and told me to have a good session and that she knows I'll land the trick today.

I landed the trick today.  That made me happy, but her text was what made the day for me."
"We finally were able to see the house we've been wanting to see and made an offer. Hopefully the buyer accepts and we can start packing up our rental. It's in the area we want our kids to go to school in, down the road from our favorite wing place (we can literally walk there) and it's in a beautiful neighborhood. 

It was on the market two months ago, but the sellers took it off because of the whole covid shit. Then they postponed putting it back on market to paint the inside. We've been wanting to see it and we're afraid that it was a list cause. I'm so excited to hear if our offer was accepted.

ETA: The seller accepted our offer!! I couldn't be happier!!"
"My city had protests last night and there was some vandalism and looting.

When I drove through today, folks were out in force cleaning up."
I told my kids in a serious tone that they need to listen very carefully, then I let one rip and made them all laugh... A moment later the smell hit them and they were trying not to gag. This is what makes dad's happy.
I went to the George Floyd protest in my small town.  The protesters were 95% young people who were engaged and well behaved.  The Sheriff came out and listened to what they had to say.
"I saw this wonderful post and read all the wonderful comments!

I also found these cute little face things!"
"I got closer to fitting back into my smallest pair of pants.

Been overeating and underexercising lately and kicked myself in the ass two weeks ago to get it together. I'm getting there, slowly but surely."
I went to the grocery store today and saw that Ranier cherries are in season, so I bought some! I love them and they are only in season for a short time each year.
"I really like this question, especially when it's very hard to find the light in times like these. 

Today, my older brother came home from work and had been listening to music. We have relatively the same taste, so I enjoyed the music, but I felt like we bonded a little. We didn't even talk to each other but he cooked and I sat with our dogs. We aren't very close with each other but we get along and this moment made me really happy."
"My coworker started singing ‚ÄúMickey Mouse Club‚Äù

Edit: Unfortunately, its not Mickey Mouse Club House. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the leader of the club thats made for you and me? M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E! Hey there, high there, ho there, You‚Äôre as Welcome as can be. M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E‚Äù"
Had a pretty decent job interview via Skype, it went well I think. It's awkward to do an interviewwith 4 people online but not a bad experience.
I finally came out as bi to my parents after years of being scared and while they were hesitant at first, they both called me today and said they support me no matter what.
It was yesterday but I made a pillow fort and acted like a child for a little bit, it felt good to just relax under my homemade roof and watch some tv, lol.
Today I got out of the shower and my dog started licking my toes, I know it sounds weird, but he rarely shows any kind of affection towards me, that put a smile on my face
I broke up with my girlfriend over the weekend so past few days have been rough but today I was able to wake up before noon and get some work done. Feels good to be a little productive.
The neighbors grandma who was 80 had a birthday party and eighty.Everyone was stood like 5 feet apart while talking.So wholesome
"I‚Äôve been working on a model train set with the guy I recently have started seeing. It‚Äôs a fun, wholesome project that we‚Äôre both excited about. I bought some miniatures for it and sent him a picture like ‚Äúlook what I got‚Äù and he responded ‚Äúthose are awesome but they‚Äôre the wrong scale, but it‚Äôs ok, we will just make a diorama just for them‚Äù. The trains he has are N scale and the miniatures I got were HO scale, which would basically make them Amazonians walking around the city. 

My last relationship literally called me ‚Äústupid and lazy for not reading the label‚Äù if I bought the wrong drink or sauce. But the fact the new guy remained positive, knowing I was just excited about the project, and just wants to make a bunch of fun projects with me really brought a smile to my face."
"I got an email from LA county asking me submit my diploma and transcripts. This is for a job I applied for 14 months ago. I don't know if it means I'm going to get an offer, but if I do it will be life changing. My last job went kaput and I'm worried about life after unemployment runs out.

If I get it, the job will pay 40% more than my last one and I'll finally be truly financially secure"
Argued with my father about the protests. We have a lot of disagreements politically but today we found common ground. It feels good.
"My boyfriend and I went for a walk for the first time since quarantine started. We saw at least 5 doggos. That made us happy. :) 
Also, afterwards we bought ice cream. :)"
"Got my pool all set up and opened.
Waiting for it to get nice and warm now :)
Quarantine or no, it‚Äôs going to be a lovely summer with the pool, some BBQ and relaxing on the back patio :)"
I went to orientation and got my uniform for my new job, that I start Thursday. :) I'll be able to work and help my family through the pandemic
Me and my girlfriend found a new place in our local area. A nice spot to swim in the river where the water is fairly still and warm, and there‚Äôs benches and a just really cozy.
Going to get buried but my jasmine started blooming today and the scent on the breeze was lovely and ot was something small that lifted my mood
My best mate is 4 1/2 months sober. He gained a lot of weight drinking and eating like trash but over the past few weeks has hit the exercise routine and healthy eating habits like a goddamn champion. He walks 5 miles everyday and is doing physical activities on top of it. Today he‚Äôs on the mend from a bit of bruising a soreness...what from? He spent the afternoon with me kicking the footy. What a legend. I give him six months and he‚Äôll be half the person he is today. Today I‚Äôm just happy about his new path.
I saw a lynx today while mountain biking. I‚Äôve never seen one in the wild before. Kitties make me happy.
"I'm a high school student and just before the pandemic I had a great part time job. As the story goes with most I was laid off. But today I found out that the job I applied for hired me.

Edit: Spelling"
"I found out today I‚Äôm getting out of the hospital tomorrow and will be allowed to carry my baby to 34 weeks instead of delivering a super premie this Friday. 

AND I got a call from my daughters new kindergarten teacher. We weren‚Äôt able to tour the schools we are holding spots in so it‚Äôs been hard to decide what we will be doing for kindergarten next year. We can‚Äôt afford her private program anymore, and I‚Äôve been fretting because I‚Äôm going to be dealing with a new baby with breathing issues while trying to transition her to an new school after the spring/summer of covid. It‚Äôs a lot of chaos and change for a little four year old to navigate. The new kindergarten option is going to be perfect for her learning needs, and it‚Äôs one less thing weighing on my mind."
I called my old job and asked if I could help for the summer. I assumed that I couldn't because of how businesses have been struggling, but I really need to do something with myself so I thought I would try. My manager was so excited and told me to come in tomorrow. I just felt so valued and wanted.
A student told me I'm her favorite teacher. I've been struggling with depression for quite a while and everything that's going on right now makes it a lot worse, but her message (and how spontaneous it was) really lifted my spirit.
We've been doing some spring cleaning and I posted on my neighborhoods Facebook page to give away some things. A shelf, some cat toys and a little drone. Everyone was really happy for me to donate the stuff. But the lady who I gave the drone to was really thankful and her kids were really happy to get it. She kept thanking me and telling me how happy she was really made my day
My closing costs are significantly lower than I anticipated, by Friday I should be a home owner AND can afford a washer/dryer for to put in said home!  My mortgage is less than what I pay in rent.
I live in Switzerland, today was the first day some of my coworkers who I haven‚Äòt seen in 3 months returned to the office. It was just really nice, everyone seemed happy and at ease, it was a nice change of pace.
This sounds super nerdy but my online piano lesson went really well. Like I played my pieces and they went really well and my teacher said it sounded really good and my sight reading had improved from last week.
this sounds really stupid but i FINALLY played a barre chord on my ukulele and i also managed to chuck which is something i‚Äôve been trying and failing to do. sounds small, but i felt so proud lol
"A baby deer -- no more 15 pounds and all-bespeckled -- mistook me for it's mama. I had to deal with the lil' bugger nuzzling my leg, giving me big puppy-esque eyes, and squealing with delight. 

That made my damn day. And yes, the mama was watching from nearby and I eventually convinced the baby I was, in fact, not it's mama."
"1. I realized it's my irl cake day tomorrow, less than two hours now.
2. I just finished my entry for a remix competition"
I got the entire Dune series in paperback from Amazon, so I get to start that adventure tonight before bed.
Small thing, but I found out Haggen, the grocery store, makes their own version of a popular snack mix I always used to get from 7-11 before they discontinued it.  Great for car rides and movie nights.  Good to know I wont have to go back to my home state and find an Amish store to get it now.
I saw one of my students today for the first time in months. She is autistic and doesn't really get along with other kids. She was my only student that showed up, so we just sat and talked and joked for the last hour. She said I'm the only human she makes eye contact with. Simultaneously broke and filled my heart!
My girlfriend told me that she had a good day in therapy. And her therapist said she‚Äôs making good strides
I have been on a diet for 1 month, today was my weight day and I lost 17lbs in 1.5 months.  With sport and a healthy diet.
"There was a guy standing on the sidewalk on my way to work wearing one of those inflatable T-Rex costumes, but it had a face mask on. He was holding a sign that said ""T-Rex hates asteroids and Covid-19""."
"I accidentally told one of my favorite villagers on my Animal Crossing island to move out the other day. Luckily a friend of mine was able to take him in and then give him back to me.  

[Made me so happy to see him back on my island this morning](https://i.imgur.com/woFfJur.jpg)"
"Im 7 days sober from weed after using it to self medicate youth trauma, depression etc from early teens to 30. 
Solved a lot of the trauma, pain and suffering last couple of years, while still using it to cope. Bettered my lifestyle. Quitting has become much easier now. 
Im at peace with myself."
Left my house as soon as curfew was up to get some McDonald's for breakfast. No line, food was ready as soon as I got to the second window. Back home before my parents were up for work and ate it while binging more of Avatar.
"I went to the animal shelter and met the cat I‚Äôm going to adopt on Saturday. I have to wait so they can do one last wellness check on him with their vet.

I haven‚Äôt been this excited for anything since I was a child, which was a pretty long time ago."
My wife asked if she could convince me that we were happily married if she went back in time to our first date.  Because she doesn't want to envision a world with time travel if it doesn't involve me by her side <3
"My chubby kitten look at me this morning with sleepy eyes and honestly after almost 10 years of having her I still don't understand how she could be so cute and perfect. I guess, I love my cat so much lol.

&#x200B;

Is this what parents feel when they see their children? haha."
Finding the motivation to get up, eat a balanced breakfast, and ran for two miles with my dog.  Then we sat by the pond under willow trees for a hour in quiet.  It was so blissful, I forgot how much I loved it.
My husband has been gone for months on a rotation for the army. I got to FaceTime with him for a little while. That‚Äôs what keeps me going most days is that I‚Äôll get to spend at least some time talking to him on FaceTime
This thread. There's so much negativity out there this week it seems. Not that all of it is unjustified, but it's definitely tiresome.
"My lawn service came today, which happened to be the same day as my neighbors lawn service.

Now the strip of grass between their driveway and my yard is the same height."
"I was working today (police officer) and I talked to some random delivery guy. He‚Äôs black and I‚Äôm White. 

He asked me what I thought of all going on told him my view on it. Told him I‚Äôm glad people protest it‚Äôs their right but the people who loot and destroy their communities are assholes. Said the guy in Minnesota is a fuck head and told him yeah like every other job you have bad eggs. He asked me if I think some cops are racist I told him yes and told him some act like bullies. He told me most cops are good people who get lumped with the shit ones. 

Guy asked me i how I view people I told him you can be black white asian Hispanic straight gay trans anything if your not an asshole your fine with me. We first bumped, it was a good day. Random delivery driver I forgot your name but your are a good dude."
Reading these answers.  I am having a very rough time this week, but seeing the little things that make peoples' day has made me realize that I do have some things to be thankful for.
My mom and sister are spending the afternoon together. And I'm enjoying I'm actually quite afternoon with the puppies and the kitties. and my leftover manicotti from dinner last night made me happy too.
While on my daily walk, I encountered a young mom and her son, also taking a walk. He stopped me, asked me my name, put his hand out and introduced himself. He couldn‚Äôt have been more than 3.  It made my day. (His mom reminded him that right now we aren‚Äôt supposed to shake hands).
"just heard a few minutes ago that my dads coming home from the hostpital

it wasnt too serious, but nothing to brush off either"
I tossed a donut stick in my right hand and a fudge round in my left at the same time and caught them in unison. I didnt have my glasses on, so I feel like a badass. I'm delirious from lack of sleep
"I saw my family today for the first time in 2 months. 
And my grandad got to meet his great grandson (my nephew) today for the first time!
Had to keep reminding him he had to keep 2m not 2 feet away though!"
My flat didn't burn down even though the smoke-detector went off and I still successfully managed to cook!
"All staff were returned to 100% hours and pay!   
Even better, we didn‚Äôt lose a single staff member to redundancies because of the cost cutting measures we put in place."
"i spent the day cleaning the house since both of my parents are working & i didn‚Äôt want them to have to clean this weekend. my dad (who is currently working from home bc coronavirus) was going to run to the store to get food for dinner & asked if there was anything i needed while he was out. i jokingly said ‚Äúwellll you could get me a coffee if you want to‚Äù, not expecting him to actually consider getting it. i drink a lot of coffee, and normally my parents try to reel in the amount of coffee i buy from coffee shops because, you know, money. however, he said ‚Äúsure! what exactly do i need to order?‚Äù which was very surprising. so now, after spending hours cleaning the house, i get to enjoy a nice triple shot vanilla latte thanks to my fantastic dad.

TL;DR my dad bought me a vanilla latte"
My dad, who has been fighting covid on a ventilator for the past month, came home from the hospital today.  I couldn't be happier
I got to work with some of my taekwondo students remotely, and they were so goofy and excited I almost cried.
I got to say good morning to my little fish. He is my quarantine buddy and has kept me sane this whole time.
My girlfriend recently got a tutoring job and she had her second day today. She was giddy and all happy while telling me about her kids. Made me happy too.
"My friend told me that the best thing someone said to them is ""I don't deserve you"" which i said only minutes ago. u/amatour-phycopath"
I came out to my dad as transsexual... He said he love me no matter what! I was so happy that I cried
I am an African American woman and I had about 3-4 people reach out to check in on me today considering the state of the US. It meant a lot to feel supported and that people care.
We just bought a house in a new state and our lease here is almost up. I was afraid my bf and I wouldn‚Äôt find a job in time but I got a call for an interview today for Friday and he got a call for an interview tomorrow. It‚Äôs all coming together after months of trying.
I went to the dentist- no cavities! This used to be unheard of for me but I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come with brushing and flossing every day.
I jogged past a group of young kids sitting on their porch with their wiener dog. The pup thought it was playtime and started chasing after me, and the kids after him. I wasn't entirely sure he was friendly but he was a tiny thing so I stopped to pet him and he was super nice. When the kids caught up, they scooped him up and apologized, and one of them said she liked my hair. It was a pleasant exchange.
I woke up without thinking about killing myself for the first time in a very long time. A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.
Today I found out my GPA for my semester of university was approximately 0.5-0.6 higher than my cumulative average.
I shaved after like 10 years of full beard and I had a scar on my cheek and 2 girls said it was sexy.  Hell yeah.
"My kids used to fight me if I suggested that they read. They hated reading, especially my middle daughter. They saw it as a punishment.

I introduced them to Harry Potter at the beginning of the stay at home orders. We watched the movies and my wife and I talked about the stuff they left out from the books. But we wouldn't tell them everything, even though they asked. We said they had to read them.

I sat down at the table today to eat lunch and my oldest was engrossed in Book 3, while my middle had the kindle open and is 1/4 of the way into Book 2. Made my heart happy."
Had a really good laugh with my mom and successfully called the dentist all on my own (calling makes me super anxious)
I'm happy that people all over the world fight and protest against racism and police brutality. It makes me believe in humanity.
"Saturday, my SO and I set up a large umbrella on our patio. Sunday morning, I saw a pair of wrens (we previously named them ""Rin"" and ""Ren"") climbing in and out of it. As I approached, the wren flew off. I opened the umbrella and all these little sticks and fluffy debris fell to the ground. They were sitting on a nearby fence tweeting angrily at me.

I ruined the nest they were building.

Most of the remainder of the morning they were flitting about looking confused and scouting out new locations to nest. I felt so guilty. I tried to come up with ideas for alternatives that could be appealing to them to help them out. But no bites.

Monday, I retrieved a birdhouse from my mother-in-law's, which was laying around in a pile outside of her house and I brought it back home with me. I hung the newly acquired birdhouse from a lamppost we have in our backyard, about five feet from the umbrella. Within an hour, I was in my living room watching TV on the other side of the house when I heard Rin singing from my backyard. I peered out the kitchen window only to see Rin and Ren hopping all over the recently installed birdhouse. Shortly thereafter, they were both dutifully retrieving sticks from their original nest that had fallen into a loose pile under my umbrella (I didn't have the heart to throw them away) and bringing them into the birdhouse.

Today, I awoke to Rin's beautiful song. I had to check it out and I went to the back window. There was Rin, standing atop the globe of the lamp, shortly above her new home. Just singing so happily. Ren popped out of the entrance to their house and perched on a little arm with a hook for a potted plant that protruded from the same post and started chatting up to Rin.

It was just the most beautiful sight to me. So many terrible things have been going on in the world, with the past few months being particularly brutal, but seeing this pair of wrens have their home destroyed by me, just keep moving forward and rebuilding with me having some small part in making it right for them, and seeing them look so at home and, I would like to think, proud and happy with their hard work, it filled me with joy. I needed to see that. To see someone have a clear victory despite some unfair setbacks.

I am coming out of just under three months of isolation from the outside world amidst a pandemic, my city had some riots with injuries the past few nights (last night being particularly bad) over systemic injustice, all the while the threat of climate change looms over us all...and these little wrens making a new nest in an old birdhouse I set up, brought me to tears of joy as the sun rose this morning."
"I got notice that I will be working a DAY position after 12 years on rotating shift work.    The day job will greatly increase the quality time I have with my children.  I'm the happiest Dad in the world!

Cream on top, my girlfriend finally got recognized for her efforts with a raise.

Edit: Happy hands can't spell."
"I overheard a man making racist remarks at the clerk at a Dunkin Donuts and I looked at him and said ""Seriously?"" The man then gave me a dirty look but left immediately afterwards without saying anything else. It makes me happy because there's a time I would've just got my stuff and left but people seriously need to be called out on their bullshit."
We marched on a neighboring city in protest today, and I wasn't sure what was going to happen what with some of the riots breaking out. It was amazing though. So much love and support came from all directions, the police came out and spoke in support, and no one was arrested or threatened. A truly peaceful protest is a powerful thing
"I was able to talk a struggling but very receptive tearful client through a difficult moment and he ended up staying in treatment. Also, a client said she really liked my creative writing group after requesting to be switched into it. Also my coworkers really like me, we get along well and have a lot of fun. Also, people liked the Black Lives Matter shirt I wore to work today, I was nervous about that but it actually worked out just fine.
So now that I think about it...it's been a pretty good day, thanks for asking"
"My non binary partner called me to discuss theories on our favourite shows.

They have been sick for a while and cannot call often, so it was very uplifting."
I got a free rice crispy from Starbucks today! A vehicle way up accidentally dropped it at the drive-thru window. Packaging was fine but I sanitized the hell out of it anyway and victory has never tasted so sweet!
"I have been depressed and anxious for a few days now, like I am always but this time severely, I didnt eat or bathe in 3 days.
I slowly took my time and pace and ate a few meals today and took bath! It makes me happy to see progress in my mental health."
"My parents back garden had really went down hill, had old furniture and the like rotting away for 20+ years. They aren't as able as they were and have had years of bad times. 

After a hard day of work, it is all clear and ready for a huge renovation project. 

(the recycling centre reopened for booked drop offs last week)"
I‚Äôve seen a lot of compassion and unity on the internet today surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement, the world isn‚Äôt equal, but with everyone using their voices and standing together for what is right, one day it will be
I work in sales... closed my first deal after a COVID-induced, 8-week dry spell. *insert sigh of relief*
Got called back into work , been on furlough for 8 weeks and was stressed about getting made redundant
I‚Äôve been working a pretty physically intense job for the last 3 years. ever since covid , things have really taken off and I have been working 12 hour days. I‚Äôm almost in my 40s and my body just can‚Äôt hang the way it used too.  As a result, I‚Äôve called out of work more times than I care to admit to let my body rest. Yesterday I was offered a position for better pay and not even close to physically demanding and I‚Äôll be able to work less hours as well. I have been stressing going into work the last few weeks and now I feel a weight has been lifted off my shoulders.
A grant I developed was awarded today and 150 homeless people are going to have federal funds to move into their own apartments. :) Only 10% of the grant goes to administrative costs; the vast majority of the grant goes directly to rent, utility arrears, and security deposits for these homeless peeps.
"I had a great morning playing golf where I tied my personal best score on an 18-hole course. 

Shot 83 for those wondering. I‚Äôm hunting a sub-80 game this summer!"
Idk what happened but today my boyfriend and I are sooo cute and kind with each other and it's great!
"My refund from school got approved! I haven‚Äôt been working due to corona, and didn‚Äôt get the stimulus check because my mom claimed me as a dependent, so I‚Äôm glad my school is trying to help us out. 

I just graduated and I know it‚Äôll probably be a while until I find a job. So I‚Äôm saving all my unemployment and everything and this helps a lot!"
I found out I didn't have to put my dog down, didn't have to work night shift and got an offer at my dream job!
"Watching/helping my girlfriend clean out her closet this afternoon. 

We've both been in a funk these past few months and weeks. Seeing her attack the emotional baggage that comes with dealing with clutter and junk is so heartening and encouraging. I don't mind being her cheerleader or moral support, or just being the folding elf to keep things out of her way. It's a small thing but it means so much to confront your own shit in your immediate sphere- mentally and emotionally.
I'm just really proud of her today."
"A girl that I'm in love with ( after only 4 times of seeing her) just told me that she is in love with me and that she is scared that now that I know, I would ran away from her.

little did she know that this was the best news ive had in a long time. But I told her that I also love her. So now we are in love."
Sometimes when my neighbor gets really happy she kinda.. shrieks? And it sounds exactly like the way R2D2 screams. I was having a bad day and she randomly let out this scream and it made me laugh out loud!
I made an apple chicken salad sandwich for my boyfriend's lunch! It tasted good to me, and I hope he likes it!
"Took my cat out for a walk after work (he only ever goes back and forth in my yard about 50 feet looking for squirrels) and a neighbor cat he's only ever pined for through the window came over and they had an impromptu social distance Happy Hour.

I had a line going straight to my heart that I had to self administer iv antibiotics every 8 hours for weeks now, it was removed today!
Met with my counselor via Zoom to help me get though the heartache of having 2 terminally ill children. Problems are not solved, but offering me perspective and teaching me how to process the hurt is priceless.
No one is going to see this. Work Ems in nyc so it‚Äôs been pretty shitty for months but just got some cool glasses for free from some one donating them. I actually wear glasses to see so I won‚Äôt be wearing them but I have a son who loves sunglasses and is always trying to take his mother‚Äôs. So I can‚Äôt wait to see his face when I give them to him.
I saw a car drive past me with ‚ÄúI F**KIN DID IT 2020‚Äù painted on it. It made me smile because despite all the chaos, the world is still turning.
"Today I got up at 8am because im scheduled to work at 10am (had yesterday off). Sat around until 930 then started getting dressed, pulled out my phone to look at the picture of the schedule to see who im working with. I notice that it says im ""off"" tuesday june 2. In total disbelief look at my phone to confirm todays date is Tuesday June 2...BEST FEELING EVER!"
"I, a white guy, was driving down the road in a town near mine. Town is also pretty white. Two teenage white girls were holding signs that said ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù and jumping up and down. 

I had my window down listening to black sabbath at full volume. I threw out a peace sign out of my window and nodded as I drove past them. 

They both started jumping up and down and threw up their hands with the peace sign. 

Many of us are with with you my fellow black brothers and sisters. I hope this time it‚Äôs for real. 

Not only a change that moves the needle for racial equality, but a change that moves the needle for equality socially, politically and economically as well. 

A working class united for change and better lives. ‚úåüèª"
Took my 21 year old cat to the vet today fearing the worst, turns out it was something small, some antibiotics and he should be fine, I haven‚Äôt been this happy in a long time.

"I realized that my toxic relationship is what's making me suicidal, and I finally realized my worth.
Finally realized that being constantly told that I am not enough, is the biggest form of a toxic relationship."
"**TL;DR at bottom**

My big brother came home early, and I've been to a therapist (in a department for teenagers, so my parents don't need to know, that's important) three times and talked about many of my problems, including my rough relation with my parents. Their negative, it feels like they bash me down and doubt in my capabilities, and that's not all, they constantly downplay my problems unless they're ""real"". So they''d never think I'm depressed, not even slightly, and they constantly tell me to stop caring about my friends when they need help.

I talked to my brother about this. He took out two monster cans from his backpack, one was mango loco which is my favorite. It's like he knew this was coming. After I had talked about my feelings over our parents he told his side of the story. He also had the same problems, except worse. They screamed at him for having 3 E's and the rest were B's and A's (really fucking good grades), they constantly bashed him down with unnecessary comments and he was already having it tough in school where he went science during ""uni"" (gymnasie in swedish) and his classmates said he was fucking stupid and shouldn't be going science.

At this time, he was deeply depressed and suicidal. Maybe that's why he got so thin, excercising and just maybe not having an apetite. Shortly after that, my mother and little sister was outside our house so he pat my shoulder and said we'd talk about this to our parents on thursday (two days from now).

I feel so happy because I got just the support I needed, and maybe now I can finally set things straight. My grades have suffered severely since my lack of motivation and energy because of **EVERYTHING** that's been going on. From my identity crisis both on sexuality and how I wanted my life to be, to just feeling worthless and like a failure.

Finally I got it off my chest.

TL;DR: Brother got home early, told him about my issue with our parents, he had it worse and will support me on Thursday and talk about it with me to our parents."
I've been fighting being suicidal for over a week. Today my friend called me and made me laugh telling me about her dog (Who is a wrinkle monster. I don't have pictures or I'd share.) My friends have all been really nice about the fact I'm a mess, and knowing I'm loved makes me happy, even if I'm still a mess.
"My dad read my personal statement for a post graduate position, and said he was proud of me.

Something small can mean the world"
My wife started having contractions today. About the join the club soon! What a week to have a kid huh?
"I went for a long drive with my dad and bought him breakfast. 
I bought a lotto ticket and got carded. I‚Äôm thirty seven lol. She said I have young eyes. I told her thank you whist laughing I must‚Äôve looked like joker how much I smiled lol. 
I kissed my husband as he left for work.
My daughter made a fruit salad for us to share.

My 14 year old dog just took off after a bird so fast! I haven‚Äôt seen him move like that since he was 7. He‚Äôs still got it!
Black lives matter protest in front of my apartment. I live in a small, republican town, so it was nice to see people standing up in solidarity.
"I have been phenomenally abused by my family of origin for 13 years now, courts involved and everything.  They always say such nasty things about me, and their lawyer even sent my lawyer a super nasty and threatening letter to mine Friday.  Today I talked with my church about picking up a fingerprint card I need to complete in order to do a volunteer job I have wanted to do for 17 years.  The person I spoke with, who had spoken with all my references, and knows about my family mess, said, ""I wanted to tell you, your friends were all unanimous in what they said, and they all emphasized how genuinely kind you are.""  Emphasis on the word genuinely.  It can be so easy to let the gaslighting make me doubt myself, so this was one of the best things ever in my life."
I'm 18 weeks pregnant today after two miscarriages. We've never gotten near this far before and every new week feels like a victory. We'd actually decided to take a break from trying because of the losses and COVID-19 but life, uh, finds a way. Come on November!
This is making me as happy as stressed, But my brother is starting a project soon and he wants me to manage it, as somebody in their 20's this is my biggest opportunity.
I was feeling really anxious about stuff in my personal life and a friend I haven't talked to in almost a year texted me and we had a conversation about how we were and what we were doing in quarantine and now I'm not nearly as anxious as I was before üòä
Steve King was defeated in the Iowa primaries! It is excellent news and a step in the right direction! Truly a victory for Iowans and all Americans. One racist out of office, more to go
I went to the protests downtown in my city. Nearly 10,000 people all standing, kneeling, and laying down for the right thing.
Our hot tub we paid $23 for was delivered today.  My wife signed up for alerts at Walmart for hot tubs and they accidentally marked a $450 Intex one down to $23 and she ordered it and shipped the next morning.

i always find it difficult to wake up early so it was pretty exciting to see the sunrise."

"It‚Äôs my first birthday since moving to Japan, and I told my coworker a story - in broken Japanese - about how I didn‚Äôt know my first name until I was 7 years old (my family always called me by my middle name).

When I first moved here, I couldn‚Äôt even confidently order water. Now, ten months later, I can engage in fruitful conversations (of broken English and broken Japanese) with my friends and share laughs.

It feels good."
I am grounded so I can‚Äôt talk to my bff so I haven‚Äôt talked to her in a long time 3 months to be exact.today my mom surprised me with my bff outside our house it made my whole damn week!
My most finicky, particular, anal to the point of being a nuisance patient absolutely LIT UP when I came in the room and told another aide that I'm her favorite.
Reading what made redditors happy today on Reddit. I love it when people try to spark positivity and joy.
"When i walked outside and the little neighbor kids who are always outside were like ‚Äúhi hoqiL!!‚Äù (: and when i had to walk back to my door from taking the trash out, they said ‚Äúhi again hoqiL!!‚Äù 

they‚Äôre so wholesome and adorable."
After sending out at least 150+ resumes I got one email back saying they want to set up a video interview! I was so excited, looked into the company and everything to study up on them... Only to find out they were just another pyramid scheme. I guess the positive is that my application was good enough? At least?
My permanent residency application got approved today. After 6 yrs I can finally help my parents have a better life.
I got told by my best friend that I am loved and will always be. I don‚Äôt know why, but it made me feel like the most special person alive.
It was yesterday but I saw my girlfriend for the first time in atleast 2-3 months. We couldn‚Äôt see each other because her dad has a disease that makes him more susceptible to the corona virus, so her whole family hasn‚Äôt left the house since the beginning of quarantine except for food and other essentials.
The clouds were pretty this morning and when I was taking [pictures](https://i.imgur.com/LbVZzdW.jpg), I caught a [bird](https://i.imgur.com/6FVSbVO.jpg) in the very center of one shot.
Free doughnuts at Krispy Kreme all week (we cashed in today).... it‚Äôs not healthy but not many good things are

My teenage daughter took it upon herself to get a summer job. Today was her first day and she loved it.
"Went to a BLM protest. There was such a genuine care for others. It was mostly high school age to mid 20 year olds. It made me feel hopeful for the future.

‚ÄúDoes anyone need assistance‚Äù 

‚ÄúAsk the people around you- we are a family‚Äù

Brought tears to my eyes."
Finally got my eight month old daughter into a clinic to finish a round of vaccinations she would have gotten two months ago if not for covid.
"I witnessed a local squirrel and it‚Äôs family that reside in a tree next to our garden join forces to try and reach our bird feeder full of nuts that we have been progressively moving further away from a wall.

It may be quite mean but we love watching them figure out new ways of getting to the feeder."
I joined a protest in support of black lives and against police brutality. There were lots of people there

I got to promote one employee and give a raise to another. I only have 7 people working for me so that was pretty huge :)
I went to the George Floyd protest today in my town and a dude from Algeria reached out to me on social media to ask for videos of American police brutality. He told me that he is scared for me and that he‚Äôs standing on our side. It warmed my heart to see that people from around the world really do care. It made my heart soar!
My cousin told the family that she‚Äôs pregnant. It‚Äôs been a rough few weeks after our uncle died from cancer and we were all in need of some good news
i got a $20 tip! it‚Äôs not expected to tip servers  in New Zealand, we get minimum wage ($18.70/h), so it‚Äôs always really special to me to get one

My roommate spends time between the place we leased at friends and boyfriends places. She isn‚Äôt here most of the time, but it was nice to have her back tonight.

"I was riding my road bike on a quiet country road, all Spandexed up, helmet, shades, etc, and I rode past a boy on his bike, maybe 7 years old, out with his young mom, pushing his sibling in a stroller. I turned and looked at him and said, ""Cool bike, dude,"" and watched a smile spread across his face from ear to ear."

* cleaned the basement. Everdry is coming tomorrow. RIP bank account."
"My friends sat around a campfire and complained about life. Best feeling ever. 

Honestly I missed having human interaction, my parents have kept me contained in a house ever since covid.

You don't realize how precious human interaction is until you have to deal with your family constantly for 2 months"
"My dog snuggled with me on my bed, and then a package came for me. Now my dog is running upstairs to join me once again.

Update: he is now lying on my bed, partially on top of me.
Update 2: The doorbell rang, and now he is gone.
Update 3: He is back on my bed, and demanding attention."
I woke up and saw my boyfriend and our cat sleeping in my bed with me because it was a cold winter morning. Today will be a good day.
Had Italian from a restaurant I LOVE (take out of course) and watched supernatural with my husband. We had a really fun car ride there and back. Simple night, but made me happy and grateful.
I got to spend three hours today teaching my mom how to play Breath of the Wild. We laughed till we cried during the first four shrines, and when we stopped after four hours she couldn't believe how fast the time passed.
Some parts for my new Jeep came in. That sounds materialistic, but it‚Äôs much more. It means the small company building them in the US is working again. And it means that I will spend time with my best friends doing the installation. And then testing them out.
"I gave my toddler the toys she asked for in bed and told her she could play with them. She said, ""no... I'm too tired"". She then went to sleep."
A baby-ish bird was sitting very close to our window while the mom flew back and fourth to feed it, and it was very cute! eventually they both flew off, but it was about 2 or 3 feet from me :)
My husband and I got two hours alone without the kids for the first time in 3+ months. We just talked and had a great time and didn‚Äôt have to get up and worry about anyone but ourselves for those two hours. It was amazing. (Thank you MIL for coming to sit.)
"Ah perfect. I get to show off
I, woke up to a beautiful healthy breakfast. Awesome, right?
Went jogging. I think I was running for a good hour? Felt good, my arteries were thanking me!
THEN, I ate some rhubarb from my garden- being healthy really made me 10000% happier. I‚Äôve been dieting, exercising, and all that Jazz. And I‚Äôm a man of jazz. 
I studied for my Homecare courses. Which, I had no idea I‚Äôd ever get into.
Socialized, made new amigos- 
Finished the night with a doob- and look at that. My life changes probably lifted my entire cloak of anxiety & reveled the real me. The real bad ass me"
"My friend finally came out to the group chat as trans and everyone was supportive of him, I already knew about it since he confessed it to me long ago but I was so proud to be able to see just how much trust he gained to the group.

It‚Äôs been a bit hard to get used to talking with the correct pronouns since he‚Äôs not out of the closet with his family yet and the group has to be discreet about it, but I‚Äôm willing to do anything to support my friend."
My wife and I stumbled upon Dunkaroos while we were food shopping. They were not available in the U.S. for years and now they are suddenly back.
First off, I love this question. So this question and so many of these comments have made me very happy. Thanks to OP and everyone writing their wonderful, little stories. Anyway, today I had a really nice conversation with my mother. That's not new or strange but it made me very happy.

We watched Wall E and The Good Dinosaur, we played with LEGO, we went around our block and looked for bugs, stopped the ice cream man, I cooked him all three meals and he fucking loved it. 

I hate that my wife is back to work, but I will take solace in the fact that this means Dadurday is back on."
I went to play and trade and found a game that I have wanted to get back for a very long time. This Friday it will be mine. Oh yes, it will be mine.
Today is my baby girls first birthday.  Given the craziness of the world, it is nice to have such a happy soul to take my mind off of things.
I watched the video of my little sister getting married. Due to CoVID they had to postpone the wedding, but then decided to get married anyway and have a party when this is all over. Since we‚Äôre in Australia we had closed borders, groups restrictions and she lives two states away. So, we couldn‚Äôt even visit them to say congratulations. I‚Äôm so proud of her.
I‚Äôm taking my real estate pre licensing course and I passed my chapter 3 quiz on the first try! I didn‚Äôt get 100%, but I‚Äôm very proud. The previous two quizzes I failed three times and had to re-review all the material before I could take the quizzes again. Best thing to happen to me today
"I am approaching a year as a new RN at my hospital, I always stay positive no matter what and try my damn best to keep patients and families happy even though I‚Äôm still new. 

I walked into work today feeling discouraged by everything going on outside and saw I got employee of the month on my unit. Does that change what‚Äôs going on outside? No. But it definitely let me know people are noticing how I stay positive and am trying my best."
I am having a one on one day with my 12 year old grand-daughter.   Hot chocolate together and now she is watching old animated Barbie movies.   Pleasant sunny day.  Bliss.
I made some bomb ass buffalo chicken wings and they turned out amazing. Considering I‚Äôve only just started cooking meals, I feel really happy with myself right now.
My best friend told me she self-published her first book!!!! She actually published it a month ago, but she told me about it today!!! (She is shy)!! I'm so proud of her, she has been putting it off for years, but she FINALLY did it!
Tomorrow is our puppy's first birthday and my boyfriend went out and bought him a AAA tenderloin steak along with a birthday boy bandana and birthday cake stuffed toy.  I'm going to marry that man.

"I saw this older man I used to see on the bus to the trains and he was really happy to see me. 


They changed my work schedule with a days notice back in March and I never was able to tell him. He was so worried about me and I was worried about him too. It was really nice to see him and catch up for a bit. I had a birthday since the last time I saw him. When the trains schedule changed (due to low rider ship) I printed him the schedule out since he doenst have a smart phone."
My 4 year old son firmly informing browsing customers today at one of our local comic book stores about the dangers of handling single issues that aren‚Äôt bagged and boarded. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how we handle single issues! Only graphic novels!‚Äù Even though he was parroting talk we‚Äôve had to have over the course of the curious toddler years‚Äîtoday he made me a proud nerd of a father.
more than 10 days we had no water in our city area (feel myself in MiddleAges) and today at least everything was repeared!

"I finally got an air conditioner installed at my place. Its been 2.5 years since I moved in to this apartment and never could save enough to do it.

Im glad I did now! I will got to sleep in the chilled room tonight ‚ô•Ô∏è"
I started identifying my ex-boyfriend for what he really is in therapy today. He was never a boyfriend, a boyfriend loves, respects and supports you. He was an asshole abuser that trapped me in that toxic relationship.
I watched a kid fall face first into a creek, and the mom freaked out as if this 3‚Äù deep creek was going to wash her kid downstream, so she ran after him and subsequently fell into the creek as well. It was hilarious.
I saw a video of a guy Nazi saluting and immediately getting punched in the face. I can't believe they are still alright but antifa which isn't even an organisation are terrorists now.
Seeing all of the protests and outrage from people during this time reminded me that I will always have allies
I had a lay in, I finished cleaning my flat (something I'm not often motivated to do, and got to spend a few hours sitting in the sun reading and listening to music.

Something small, but the gentleman in front of me at the coffeeshop paid for my coffee. Made me smile
after years of being self conscious, today i put on a bikini and actually felt good about myself. its small but it matters :)
My husband took the day off work so that he could take care of our 4-month old and give me a break. I took a long nap, and then a long walk in our nearby state park, while I talked to my brother on the phone and had a lovely catch-up chat with him.
Got notice from HR that the company contribution to retirement starts today.  I thought I had to wait till September.
I know it isn't anything in particular, which is probably what the OP was looking for but hey, it's Reddit. Who cares. My wife. She always makes me happy.
My son is a little delayed in speech/and recognition. After working so hard to get him to point out the ‚Äúdog‚Äù in one of our books he FINALLY did it today, multiple times.
Over a thousand people upvoted a post I made. I know it‚Äôs silly to get excited over something like that but I just keep picturing a thousand people in a room listening to me and enjoying what I had to say and that‚Äôs kind of crazy LOL
I had a cool idea for my first paper in my PhD program after what felt like an eternity of (not actually) pointlessly reading old history books and tons of studies who already did all the cool stuff that I came up with before today. Let's hope I still think it's a good idea by tomorrow!
I received my valkyrae youtooz figurine , I wanted that one for soooo long and I am so happy I got it today
I went to the protest in CherryHill New Jersey. It was peaceful and wholesome. The police walked with us and everything. Was such a blessing
Me & my partner have been going through a big ass dry spell, no affection, no kissing, nothing. Today when I came home, they walked up to me, wearing my favorite perfume and kissed me off my feet.
i moved out of my parents' house ! my roommates are my two best friends and we've been having a blast the past few months. i finally moved enough out to really say i'm moved in, and on top of that my car is drivable again, so life feels like it's finally moving forward again today
My daughter put together the sweetest video of her and her classmates for a virtual graduation that they will be having. It is the sweetest clips of them being silly and how carefree they are, with a great song for it.
I took a shower and did a load of laundry. Such simple things, yet they make me feel like I'm being productive with my time while I'm stuck inside.
I turned 21. I don't care about drinking, but I would like to enjoy the city's nightlife without being carded at the door.
I taught my girlfriend how to play my childhood game, Minecraft. We‚Äôve been together one week, and I can tell she‚Äôs a keeper ;)
The goodwill reopened today & I found a vintage le creuset Dutch oven in perfect condition for $5. Jackpot!!
I maintained my workout schedule. I started working out a month ago, and my life and mindset has changed tremendously for the better since. People underestimate how much making your body feel physically better can affect your positivity.
I found out that if you go on Apple Music to the for you section there is a live playlist that you can listen to to commemorate for everything that‚Äôs been going on with the protests and stuff. Idk I like the songs and it makes me happy.
Found out that we'll be working from home the rest of the year with the possibility of it being permanent. I've gone from never having worked from home my entire working life to it being a central part of my postion!
My partner and I's 11 month old puppy let us cut her nails for the first time today! We've always had to take her to a groomer
"I got complimented on my mask while getting a band on my braces replaced :)

Also, my cat has been snuggling with me a lot today."
I went back home after being in a quarantine. I was sent to my grandpa and grandma before, because they don't go to work and the risk of getting corona virus was lower. Now, after 2 months I went back home.
I got to take a picture of a three week old kitten...and sent it to my coworkers as we are all working remotely.
"Me and my fiancee are trying to have a baby. She's SUPER high risk and we've had many miscarriages sadly. Well she's a month a week pregnant and every day she says she's not bleeding is a happy day. Granted what's going on outside but again everyday she's holds this baby I'm living my best life.

Edit: I spoke too soon. This world isn't fair"
I'm very lucky to have a totally supportive, genuinely kind hearted ex husband. Today, I watched as he laid under the covers and my 4 yr old would attempt to jump over his knees, but every time she did, he'd raise them up and she'd face plant into the bed. That giggle and 'Again!' just got me.
Saw my girlfriend for the first time in 11 weeks since our lockdown rules have been lifted. For those wondering I live in the Isle of Man where there is now only 1 active case!
"It's stupid but my friend sent me the meme shirt as a gift on animal crossing saying ""I thought you'd like this"". He's someone who I sometimes think doesn't actually care about me at all and is only friends with me because I'm always around. Little things like this make me think that maybe he actually considers me a friend and it makes me a bit happy."
Seeing this post. With all the craziness going on out there today, it's nice to see people posting positive things.
The fact that my friends asked me to meet w them tmrw to hang out. Been really socially deprived and and excited I can finally go out. They know I‚Äôm very extroverted I love my friends so friggin much
Yesterday I went strawberry picking with my two toddlers. Last night I made a batch of strawberry jam and it did not set. This morning I was able to figure out how to make it a nice thickly set jam and can it. I now have 12 beautiful jars of strawberry jam to put on there peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a lovely memory. My first jam ever! I'm proud of myself.

The 11-month-old I nanny for kept giving me hugs today and clung to me when it was time for me to leave. Of course, he adores his parents and has a happy, safe life, but after 2.5 months of being gone, I was happy he still likes me.

A random redditor gave me an award for being helpful. It was for a comment where I was trying to offer support to a woman in her third trimester of pregnancy. I want to change careers and become a midwife, and for whatever reason this just gave me more confidence in that choice.
My dog came back from the vet! She got the antibiotics she needed for her leg wound and is healing up nicely!

I was able to listen to a friend of mine vent of the problems that had arisen today. I was also able to calm her down and help her out a ton with my responses and frankly, I enjoyed every minute, sentence, and positivity of it.

I found an old cassette tape today that I had put a few songs on back in 2017 (because I felt like it). I decided to listen to it on my dad‚Äôs cassette player. Just some Fall Out Boy, The Killers and Beyonc√©. At the end of the last song I heard my grandad (who died last March) say ‚Äúhello‚Äù and my response saying hello back before I stopped the recording of the song. I cried so many happy / sad tears when I heard it. I remember that happening and I considered taping over it at the time but I decided against it. I‚Äôm so so so glad that 17 year old me didn‚Äôt tape over the only audio I have of my late grandad because it really made my day hearing his voice again even if it‚Äôs only faint and in the background. I love you Dan Dan
"I baked peanut butter cookies with my 2 year old. When I handed her the flour to dump into the bowl and said ""here's the flour"" she stopped and sniffed it. Took me awhile to realize she was smelling it because she thought I meant flowers, not flour and she was confused."
I was having a really shitty day and my favorite person on this earth (my grandpa) came to visit me. It immediately made me feel so much better just seeing him. I love you papa.

I surround myself with people who make me happy now, such as one of my closest friends. He is an amazing friend and has been talking to me so much lately and I'm so grateful for him. Talking to him makes me happy. 

I know this is sappy and about crushes and whatnot but it really made me happy today to realize this."

I‚Äôm traveling to California and it‚Äôs day two from St. Louis. Idk why I thought Wyoming was going to be super boring. Even my data went out for 4.5 hours. Best part of the trip and it made me realize how much I rely on my internet. I just listened to the radio and looked at the lovely landscape thinking of the natives and others that called  Wyoming home.

One thing today that made me happy was that I could wake up without having to worry about doing any work, get onto my computer, and browse through Reddit, looking at memes. It's been so long since I properly went through Reddit, so this made me very happy today.

It really made me happy that he was in a better mood and seemed content, I was worried about him.

We are good friends and I still take care of her, she has her own place away from her mother under the protection of a local charity. She is receiving councelling and now, two years on last march, she is sheltering with me from the coronavirus. We play board games and go for walks in the sunshine when it‚Äôs quiet.

The heat waves are creeping in and I have a shaggy dog. I usually trim her fur this time of year because she overheats easily, but she had surgery for a ruptured CCL a couple of months ago, so one of her legs is fully shaved.

I am from a small rural town in the southern United States. With the unjust treatment of so many people and with the geopolitical atmosphere of a small rural southern town, it made made me very happy to see people over come prejudices to make statements in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. While a blank statement or black square posted on Instagram may not be much, it is a step in the right direction to equality for all Americans. I hoe we can continue to educate ourselves and further this fight.

Once a week I meet with 3 friends, in the driveway of one of them.  I have only lived here for 3 years, but they are truly  my best friends and I  am  so  fortunate  to  have been invited into the group.  Thank you Olga ( old lady group affiliates).

Finally set up a date with a nice guy I've been too terrified to date. He's had a crush on me for like three years but I've been dealing with some heavy shit. I'm finally feeling like I'm in a place to pursue a relationship with him. Ngl... He's seriously, like, too good to be true <3
"This made me happy because ive been stuck in my apartment since march and have been no use to anyone.

I saw a dog wandering in the field next to me. Coaxed her in with nice words and called the owner. She was in tears. Her neighbor was driving her around due to her two broken ankles. They had been looking all day. The dog had never gotten out. The first number I called was disconnected. (It was her husband's number) this was also the 2 year mark of when her husband passed away. She was beyond happy. Wish i knew how to attach a pic of the dog. Her name is Hannah.

The fact that I can go back to school tomorrow after months of quarantine. I'm really looking forward to seeing all my classmates again
I participated in a peaceful protest in Brooklyn near the Barclays Center. Many people came up to me and said they appreciated my sign. I felt I connected with strangers who all wanted the same thing as me, a revamped system that is guided by morality. As I walked home after I saw an incredible sunset. The sun setting gave promise of a new day. In that moment, despite the wailing of the world, I was at peace with where I was. I accepted my current situation. I was happy.

I think I've finally met someone that I truly connect with. We met a few days ago but every day is better and better. It's weird saying I'm happy but he brings genuine smiles to my face and doesn't make me feel like the weird, anxious, awkward person I see myself as. üíò
I took a really nice shower and I used a simply amazing shampoo & conditioner, body wash, and lotion that all felt really good on my skin.
I was really depressed the last 7-8 days and haven‚Äôt been functional, along with not being myself. Thankfully, I was able to talk to two old friends today and my emotions were zooming sky high
I had nothing but bad news today and it was really rough, but my wife, kids, and unborn child all helped me feel better!
"My city protested, and it was entirely peaceful. The police marched alongside protesters, and kneeled showing solidarity alongside it's residents. 

The city is Paterson, we're a forgotten inner city in northern New Jersey. I can't say this enough, I'm very proud to be from Paterson, and often at times I'm disappointed with our fellow citizens, but today I was really proud of Paterson as a whole."

This thread. Reading about everyone being happy has definitely made my day. I hope everyone continues to find happiness in these tough times.
"This actually happened yesterday, but it was less than 48 hours ago, so I'm counting it.

Someone here on reddit made a reference to one of my absolute favorite Psych episodes, ""Earth, Wind and...Wait For It."" He mentioned the murderer in the episode uses arson as his weapon.  In the episode, this realization that the criminal they are searching for is both an arsonist and a murderer, leading Shawn to coin the term ""arsassin."" Which is one of my favorite words ever.  So I responded, quoting the original comment struck out murderer, replaced it with arsassin and commented ""FTFY.""  Cute little Psych reference.

Another user responded by crossing out ""arsassin"" and replacing it with ""fiurderer"" and their own FTFY because in that episode Shawn also considers ""firurderer"" as a name for someone who kills with fire.  And this made me inordinately happy, because I then got to return with the term Shawn finally settles on:  *Se√±or* *Pantalones* *de Fuego.* And another FTFY.

It was just about the perfect reddit moment and it made me so happy, then he responded with a gif of Shawn and Gus fist-bumping from that episode and it became the perfect reddit moment."
I was sad and feeling depressed so I went on to youtube to listen to some sad songs to tune in with the mood. Few min later I started checking the comment section and found people commenting on positive and motivating messages to be happy and how everyone's life matters. I dont know. Even during this pandemic and all those riots going on making this pandemic worse for people, I was happy about the fact that there are people out there who just comment nice things to make others happy. Maybe it all hit me because I was sad but it was really something that made my day.
It is my birthday today and I live 3 hours away from my relatives. Without my knowledge, my parents had called my local bakery to send me cake :)

I went to pick up fabric at my local fabric shop. I ordered online to pick up curbside. When I asked the person at the door about curb side pickup she said ‚Äúoh just head inside. They‚Äôll take care if it for you.‚Äù Turns out the store opened its doors and I could shop for anything I needed to make masks for my friends and family. I cried. It felt surreal and yet so normal. I never knew how much doing regular things impacted me and my happiness until that moment.
I got a new welder and I'm waiting on some steel supplies to arrive to start using it. Making things has been keeping my mind off of a few stresses in life and has turned into my hobby, metalwork is particularly rewarding

After a week of really warm weather it‚Äôs a going to be a week of rain and the smell wafting in from the window of the wet trees and grass is heavenly."
One of my work friends suffers from pretty bad anxiety and depression and I didn't see him at work today so I assumed it was one or both getting to him. I ordered his favorite pizza and picked up a 2 liter of a soda he really likes and left it outside his house just because. I texted him as I left to check out his steps and he seemed pretty happy and surprised, so that made me happy.
i woke up to daydream believer by the monkees on the radio resonating through the house and my dad busting a move in the kitchen. warmed my heart and a great way to start the day!
"My parents went with me to check out a rental property, then came with me to an electronics store where I purchased a new television. 
We don‚Äôt spend a lot of time together so something as simple as this made me happy."
My sister turned 18 today. And because we couldn‚Äôt celebrate due to the lockdown, we arranged a call with all her friends and our extended family, and made a magazine based on her life with articles written by those closest to her. The happiness in her eyes made me happy today!
I ran my first ever D&D session on Sunday after having less than a week to prepare. I woke up today with a text message from a 15+ year player saying they had fun and it was well done given the circumstances. It was 3.5e which I heard is way more complicated, so I spent most of that week stressing on numbers and plot ideas.
Found a farmer parked on the roadside with a small truck of mangoes, early this morning. He had driven all night to get to the city and he didn't know where to sell. Since Covid lockdowns began, farmers are forced to sell directly to consumers. And many of them have never been to cities. They come with their produce and find the city roads deserted and shops shut. I talked to him and invited him to my apartment complex of 250 apartments where his excellent mangoes got sold out. And he is coming again soon with other farmers and other fruits! He was relieved to make contact with customers. And I was happy to meet a real farmer and help him sell.
I was 257 pounds when I went back to work (May 11th). Just checked right now and I‚Äôm at 246. Not much but I‚Äôm super proud of myself.
It's my brother's birthday. The country's in lockdown so couldn't invite/meet friends and family. Tried to make his day special by preparing a grand feast and organising a mini treasure hunt within our home. Seeing him happy and enjoying all of this made us happy üòá
I‚Äôm pet sitting, so I got to wake up to my two ferrets and two puppies all excited to see me! Feels like going to heaven if it existed
Hey youü§è! Yeah you reading this comment, you just made my day and I‚Äôm happy believe in yourself because I believe in you!
I went swimming in this beautiful lake in the mountains. And my dogs puppies are officially 1 week old!
My teacher told me that she wishes i ll do well in my exam because me and other 3 kids were the only ones trully active in her class. Idk why, but it made my day. Plus my dad heard that and said well done =)
A frog was almost crushed in my car door and when I nudged him to move to a safer spot, he jumped on to my pant leg and hitched a ride for a couple of seconds before jumping off. It was neat.
Heard a pretty funny story from my grandmother today. My brother lives in an apartment in her basement and this past weekend he had been out drinking with some friends and came home VERY drunk. For some reason, when he got inside he decided to get buttass naked and then walk upstairs to grab something to eat. My grandmother heard something going on in the kitchen and went to investigate. And there she was met by the sight of my brothers bare ass sticking out of the fridge. She couldn't do anything but laugh and send him back downstairs. He woke up the next morning thinking it was a dream. He soon found out it was not.
"A friend of mine texted me out of the blue: ""Big fat thank you, cause you made my life betterüôè""
I answered: ""That's what I'm here for ig ‚ù§Ô∏è""
And she replied:"" And you have to get so much love in return ‚ù§Ô∏è words can‚Äôt describe what a nice and warm hearted person you are. You light up the world with your amazing character and you need to always keep that in mind! You are loved and deserve the best and even more üñ§ if you ever need help I‚Äôm here for you because I would love to help. Please take this serious. Love you üñ§""

Just feels nice to make a positive impact :')"
"I was going to the convenience store, feeling extremely anxious and thinking about killing myself as always, when a random kitten started rubbing itself on my leg. I kneeled and it climbed on my lap and it hugged me while purring. It was the neighboor's and it was so precious, it made me forget everything for a moment.

I'm still anxious and suicidal right now but I felt so blessed."
My son left his toy dinosaurs out overnight and I set them up like they were trying to escape out the door before he woke up. :)
since the world decided to go to shit the best thing that happened to me today was that i reached the max level for my shark in Maneater
Having a lizard walk straight up to me. It was the most heartwarming moment, especially because i've been trying to befriend him.
I went from thinking I wasn‚Äôt going to graduate to finding out I made a honors roll. How did that happen?? I can‚Äôt even spell honors.
Peaceful protests against bigotry, all over the world. That made me happy. I cried and screamed and raised my fist, sitting in my living room. I may be old, but I can still support change.
I was upset so I want to sleep and woke up to my cat sleeping right next to me on my arm best feeling ever.
I overcame my habitual self-centredness through meditation, developed love for everyone, wished upon each and every one of them a deep and profound happiness and joy that would heal their minds. Anyway for one hour whilst I ran my errands, everyone treated me like a dear friend, strangers waving from cars. Magical. Would recommend it to anyone! :) Then I developed an ego (:
"Had a date night with my girl for the first time in six months.
Between quarantine and having a one year old it was our first time alone in that long as well, and it was an amazing break ‚ù§Ô∏è"
I was playing Far Cry 4 and my puppy just came and sat on my lap. When I pushed her to my side she just came back. After 5 minutes of this I just let her stay. It was pretty amusing and it made me happy that she loved me.
Got to watch the sunset with my son and my boyfriend for the first time since moving to a new town ~1.5 weeks ago. It was a very much needed comfort
Seeing this question, focused on positivity made me happy! Thank you. May you and yours be and remain happy and healthy!
I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was happy. I genuinely consider throwing myself off the highway everyday.
After years, I reconnected with a friend I had since I was 3 years old. We both remembered the memories we shared since back then and she's like my first friend so yayyy. Our families were very close too.
I went to ALDI an didn't have a coin chip (you need them in Germany for detaching) for the trolley - walking towards the entrance disheartened and checking my pockets a woman came out of the store noticed my situation and said with a smile that I could have her trolley(didn't need a chip or so) - made my day :)
"A few months ago my husband found a stray dog in our apt complex who was starved and limping. She was extremely sweet and came right up to us. Our complex was going to call the city who certainly would have put her down, so we took her in despite not really having the means or space. We decided to foster her with the help of a local charity.

She got adopted today."
Neighbor, wearing baggy shorts, eagerly attempted to show us the big bruise on his thigh from catheter insertion during recent emergency stent procedure, accidentally flashed everyone. It made me happy that despite all the bad and scary stuff going on, we could still laugh hysterically. And I‚Äôm happy that he‚Äôs okay.
My boyfriend came home after having to work out of town last night! We now get to pop each other‚Äôs pimples, cool food together and watch scrubs. He‚Äôs my space heater for life!
"I tested a young boy and his mother for COVID-19 today. He was the cutest kid ever and asked me questions about science and medicine. He was old enough to understand the severity of the virus but he was so brave and he wasn't afraid of getting tested. 

He was just happy to talk to me about why he loves science and wants to help people like we do when he grows up.

Best day ever."
Am late so this will be lost but... I started a job in the career field I want. I get to be around dogs and puppies all day. My first day was today and I got to be with pups that weren‚Äôt even 24hrs old yet.
"Reading all these messages.

Have been hearing about bad things a lot lately, covid-19, racism, violence etc. Reading all these messages and imagining smiles on people's faces made me emotional and pretty happy today."
I‚Äôm going through ivf right now, I‚Äôm actually cray cray. And my partner just keeps meeting me with love. I cried for no reason, and he just sat with me. I got mad and he just offered me food from a safe distance. I told him I felt ugly and fat and he just grabbed a boob, he makes me so happy every day but today he was my happiness.
I showed someone a lot stronger than me my methodology and he said he did it in the same way!Very validating!
I think I'm falling in love with a woman who's also falling in love with me. I hope it keeps growing. I like it, because for the first time in years, I have hope.
I‚Äôm buying my dream car in an hour.  1992 Miata.  I‚Äôve loved Miata‚Äôs since before I even knew what a Miata was.  They‚Äôre such happy looking cars.  I‚Äôm only 20, but my god; this is by far my biggest achievement and I couldn‚Äôt be happier for myself.
"Not today, but early Monday morning this week. Ex‚Äôs friends from a server reached out via Snap and asked if I was ok. They remember I work in healthcare and grew extremely concerned for me, but were afraid to reach out because of the breakup.

I can‚Äôt explain how much I missed them, practically bawled over FaceTime. We used to play on multiplayer games 2x a month. I‚Äôm so happy they still like me!"
"At my work currently we're building so we have to wear safety vests (those that reflect light) and apparently the sign was hanging behind my neck the whole day and when I went to grab something out the storage room, the lady there told me to quickly come into her office, she then grabbed scissors and told me to turn around, and she snipped away the sign. Made me smile

Btw: sorry for my english"
"I know this is an older post, and no-one is really gonna see this, but that's ok! I just needed to get this off my chest :)  


Anyways! My girlfriend has recently started commenting and posting on reddit, and she got her first little bit of karma, and her joy and excitement from it made me unbelievably happy.  
I don't understand how a person can be so cute, it was pure joy, and it spread like wildfire to me, made me extremely happy :D!"
I got asked to watch a movie virtually with someone today, so i'm looking forward to doing that after work :) yay quarantine hangouts
One of my favorite YouTube channels, SuperCarlinBrothers, is participating in #blackouttuesday and not posting their video today. They're good guys but I wouldn't have expected them to do that.
I got to FaceTime my brother who‚Äôs only 13 months older than me who‚Äôs in the army in another country.
I made cinnamon rolls from scratch, worked with yeast for the for first time and in my very critical opinion, I thought it was good!!
I drew more of my Enders Game au where is Ender is an actual dragon. I also drew a salamnder combined with an otter.
I found a button on my record player that pitches up the music. It sounds ugly and annoying, so it's the perfect tool to annoy my family.
This will get buried but I got a job offer today that I wanted so, so badly. I get to submit my paperwork on Thursday!
Saw a house with gay and trans pride flags on my (rather conservative) street! Made me so overwhelmingly happy to see that here :‚Äô)
I made a really delicious bacon egg cheese breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel toasted with cheddar cheese. I have enough supplies to make at least 3 more but I‚Äôm going to have to restrain myself, lol
Not a damn thing. I know the day isn't over yet, but if the past year(all consecutive months) are anything to go by, the rest of the day doesn't look too promising.
I was finally able to get my hair done. It wasnt a huge deal until I realized how much stress I was holding in. This is the most relaxed I've felt in months.
"I went and picked up the car we've been wanting. Also, my traeger grill should be getting delivered today. 


.......it's been an expensive day"
I played a certain game for six years now (and counting) and 2 years ago i was ranked 13. in Europe  for the class I was playing. Paused for some time and came back to playing it with a new character with the same nick and someone actually recognized me for my skill and it felt real good being known for something that I managed through out practice and grinding.
"I failed my written driving test today and was very bummed about it and i got into a bad mood and was kinda dramatic...

Then i go downstairs to get a drink and pet my dog, by the time i get back up the stairs i hear my phone buzz.

My female friend sent me a long message about how it isn't trivial and I'm much better than that and complimented me, and it really warmed my heart to know someone cares about me that much."
"My husband and I enjoyed lunch together (both WFH), I felt my baby kicked throughout the day, 
and I fixed some production issues at work quickly before they made too much impact. All in all, a pretty great day üòä"
"Talked to my therapist today. He reminded me that despite encountering hate, if I continue to speak truth via social media, someone at some point may be positively affected by what I say.

And to anyone who looks at my post history and sees me losing my temper, know that I‚Äôm trying to change that."
I got a surge of joy when I cut my client's hair. I've been back for week, but this bob just made my day!  It's not an easy cut to do, and it is pure sass when executed well.  My client needed some education regarding products and tools too, so I had the opportunity to teach. I really missed my job and I love it.
Happy cake day to both of us! Today I reserved a condo that sits on the edge of the Gulf of Mexico on Capitiva in Florida. Four nights of no kids, fishing, swimming, rolling around with my hubby...what more does a girl need?
All three of my cats chirped when I petted them before going to work.  Normally at least one of them stays silent.
I read a manga of an adventurer settling down to have a peaceful life, it made me feel happy the feeling of a peaceful life.
I bought my husband his favorite kind of cherry milk from the store as a surprise. Kind of small but I'm excited for when he comes home.
"I had finally made an appointment with my dr to talk about my undiagnosed ADHD, I was so afraid of being ignored or blown off, or be treated like a drug seeker, but she was very nice and understanding!


I had to set up another appointment for further evaluation but I finally got the process started!"
It's not much, actually. I've been so sad the last few days over all of the shit going on right now in this country. My guy and I were at the car wash. He was vacuuming his truck out when he pointed the vaccuum at me and sucked my hair up and giggled. Like I said, it wasn't much but in that moment, I rolled my eyes, laughed and realized how much I love him.
"My work has a program where I can transfer leave (paid time off) to someone else if they meet certain criteria.

I got notified today that my request to transfer 40 hours to someone I know got approved.  Knowing that he won't have to worry about work for another week and focus on recovery from a bad surgery experience gives me a sense of satisfaction, especially since it was time I wouldn't be able to use."
finally got off my ass and started a 5 week workout plan. i have a supportive girlfriend to back me up and i‚Äôm confident that i‚Äôll be seeing some real personal improvement soon.
My grandma told me her secret that no one knows other than me. :) It's a sad secret but she trusted me enough to tell me, so that maybe i can help her.
Finally vocalised how I feel about myself as a person and I believe it has set me up to get my life together and I couldn‚Äôt be more excited
I'm most likely getting a work transfer to the same city as my boyfriend. Half of our relationship has been an LDR and I'm so excited to really start our lives together
"I don't feel sad or down over ""*nothing""* and that tells me i'm getting better mentally and emotionally.   
The simple thought of beating my mental illness one day at a time makes me truly happy."
My father in law who is a great person and i get on  great with, 3 weeks ago caught covid 19, he was in a coma and on a ventilator for the last 2 weeks. Today they brought him out of the coma and removed the ventilator! Today is a good day!
I rescued a dog late last night and she turned out to be amazing.  Had never been on a hard floor surface, in a house or on a leash.  She‚Äôs almost mastered them and we got her last night.  Just got home from the off leash and now she‚Äôs passed out on the couch.  Great day!
"I got hired by an ambulance company :)
I've been working dead end jobs since I was 18 and I'm 23 now."
"My 3yo niece told me she loved me and that I'm her best friend again.

Made me happy especially since 2 days ago I was no longer her best friend, her kindy teacher had usurped my position."
I have been working 10-16 hour days on my app. Sometimes days without sleep trying to create a great game for people to enjoy. For the first time since march I went out and had some beers with my mates. Was great to have abit of time off and have a laugh.
" I jumped off a rope swing into a lake even though I'm immensely scared of hanging onto something and then letting go.

The feeling of falling isn't my kind of feeling and it could stem from an accident I had when I was four. It left me with 16 stitches on my forehead and a  wound that exposed my skull."
My ssd came in and I was able to install it and my PC is now better than it was before and I am very happy. :)
i got to see my boyfriend for the first time in a while today, and it‚Äôs a small victory but cooking dinner at my apartment with him is going to be the best meal i‚Äôve had in ages
It was my birthday! I met with my girlfriend and did my online lessons with her, then we went out to meet 2 of my friends. I saw my best friend for the first time since March. It was a really happy day for me and I think the others enjoyed it too.
I went through my facebook friend list and started messaging everyone i thought might talk to me to catch up with people. Even though I'm staying home and my GF recently broke up with me, I now have a date, & I feel personally connected and up to date with about a hundred people. Other people's happiness is contagious.
An incredibly boring one but I'm on night shifts and don't get a lot done... But it finally rained after weeks of heat!
Brother proposed to his GF! Both amazing people, and I'm just so happy for them! Am the luckiest person to have such an amazing future sister-in-law!
Seeing my 87 yo grandmother and making her smile with a visit, flowers and biscuits. She has broken her ankle, so she needs to be spoiled.
One of my clients told me that I‚Äôm the type of man who could wrestle a bear which definitely made my day
"My Nonna made the best goddamn pancakes in the world again

I also bonded a lot with my six year old cousin, so that was an unexpected pleasure, too"
Got a promotion, and am moving to a different better department, away from an asshole manager that I now outrank. More money, holiday and responsibility and my own office. Good fucking day.
I woke up and talked with my girlfriend living thousands of kilometers away. I am grateful we're still strong despite the distance:)
"My kids have been jerks all day but were super happy that I set the kiddie pool up. Their happiness. 

(And a beer while they splash around, that helps)"
I had an initial consultation with a therapist and she seemed really great! I have a few more consultations this week so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll work with her yet, but it gave me hope that therapy will help me.
I've been trying to adopt a cat that's been in the shelter since January and after going through the hoops and hassles of adoption fees and deposits, I got my girl home in time for her birthday (June) and she and I watched one of her kittens get adopted on our way out! Now she won't leave my side and she hasn't stopped purring since. Mama Ru (my new cat) says hi!
"My boyfriend and I both started out new jobs today. And everyone we met (virtually) was very nice and politely curious to meet us.

And one of my closest friends is about to give birth to her first baby!"
"Bit of a rollercoaster, but in the same 5 minute conversation I found out that my (28F) aunt (32) gave birth to my new cousin last night, but there were complications. The baby was in shock from a traumatic birth and wasn't breathing for her first 5 minutes and my aunt started hemorrhaging blood. After being rushed to the OR and having a constant stream of blood transfusions, she lost an equivalent of 90% of the blood in her body throughout the night. Thankfully, this morning she and baby are doing well, they are in ICU, and she is successfully breastfeeding! Albeit very weak and tired. 

I'm just happy to know I haven't lost a part of my family and that we have a new addition to love, once we're able!"
"I got a ton of encouraging replies to a depressed comment I wrote earlier. I was so overwhelmed by so many bad things happening both in my life and everywhere else, but after I vented about it in another r/askreddit thread, I got so many wholesome comments and messages from complete strangers letting me know I don't have to face my depression alone.

There's still so much good in this world and I desperately needed to be reminded of that fact. There are good people with good hearts here, and knowing that gives me the strength to keep moving forward through this difficult time. I needed that positivity more than I think anyone realized. 

Sure, Reddit has its ups and downs, but in the end, it's still so full of people who are here to make other people smile, and I think that's beautiful."
My daughter brought out a couple of yoga mats into the kitchen while I was making lunch and she started doing the downward dog pose while our little dog sat on the other mat in what we‚Äôre going to call child‚Äôs pose just for the juxtaposition. It was the first time I‚Äôve really laughed in a week probably.
I made a joke to my supervisor at work about how it‚Äôs so hot we should get ice cream, someone overheard and by the end of the day he felt so bad saying no to everyone that he‚Äôs getting us ice cream later this week
I uploaded a video of my piano improvisations to YouTube for the first time. I've been avoiding it for almost a year now, and today was the first time I had the willpower to deny my doubts.
"Helping a friend through rough patch, today they said ""You make me feel better"".   
Made me really happy knowing that."
I cleaned my room and showered. Then i was able to sneak in one episode of an anime and read some gay fanfic before going to bed. Great way to end the last day before school even if i didnt get my work done. [Help]
I was laying outside stressed as hell and closed my eyes for a minute and a warm breeze came by and made me feel comfortable for a moment.
"My 2 year old jumped on the bed for about 5 minutes straight, threw himself in a twist, looked at me and farted

Daddy has never been prouder"
Call center woman from the Philippines told me how friendly I was compared to the irate people she usually talks to
"Just finished volley ball session today! After all this covid and working really hard for my ""not in a good situation"" startup, it was just nice to enjoy weather and playing just for fun !"
Moved to a new apartment in a more quiet location and it looks like i will get accepted into my first choice of high school!
"A friend of mine told me I'm a good friend. It's rare, I often fuck it up, but man did it make my day. It didn't help with my home life as much, but it did truly make me happy. I'm happy. Thanks kid.


I do wonder sometimes if you check my reddit, if you do, then you know it's you  :)"
"My dad was discharged from the hospital! I pulled in to their home right at the same time he did with my mum. 
We very well could have lost him from a bad fall. But a quick surgery and some bruises to heal,  and he is doing great."
I watch Larisa Stow live on Facebook everyday for chanting, and when we do our daily ritual of shaking off thoughts and energy we don‚Äôt want, I laugh. It makes me happy:)
A friend sent me the perfect job posting to me.  What is special about this is that we couldn't stand each other a while back and have come to a place where we can cheer each other on.  Cheesy, but true.
I asked my crush out to play tennis. I know I might be rejected, I'm ready for that, but I had the courrage to ask her out. It's something I always struggled with and I'm making progress!
Was happy to see the mayor of Birmingham stick by their word and take down the confederate monument at lynn Park last night.
I got to spend the whole day with just my brother and 6yr old nephew. We went mini golfing, played Mario Kart, got snow cones and went swimming. It's been a while since we've had a day with just the guys.
I've put a bunch of stickers in my pen, now I can do all of my university papers with a smile in my face üòÅ
They delivered a Port-a-John to our house, which signifies that our renovation project is actually happening!

Literally two hours mucking about in virtual mud trying to get to crap trucks unstuck. Was a perfect tonic."
"All my friends are donating, marching, and spreading awareness of police brutality. Some of them are giving hundreds of dollars even though they're unemployed. 

I'm lucky enough to have a job, and today my CEO offered to match any donation to help the protest efforts. 

Seeing my friends, coworkers, and neighbors stand up for each other in a seriously meaningful way has buoyed my spirits."
I took a 30min walk with my parents, did  90min of Bikram yoga, snuggled my dog, had a nap, and cooked some delicious rice with lentils... all HAPPY things for me.
I managed to fit my bike inside of my car which means I can go places to bike around and that for some weird reason really made me happy
My girlfriend and I started to make plans to move in together in a few months. Once things settle a bit more. We both live with our families and she works in healthcare so seeing her with Covid going on has been difficult/stressful. This way we won‚Äôt have to put others in danger to be with each other.
Went shopping for ice cream and met an old friend of 14 years that I rarely talk to nowadays... Had a really good chat with him and a lot of fun talking about what he'll do after school.
I sent in the final paperwork to complete my internship. I'm about to be awarded my Administration Certification.
Been talking to this girl for a week, she‚Äôs very cute with a personality to match. We‚Äôve been and it‚Äôs been going very well, and I‚Äôm very excited to meet her once quarantine eases up. Thankfully I‚Äôve already met her before so it‚Äôs not a catfish, but I‚Äôm pretty happy rn. Also gonna watch Animal Kingdom with her tonight
My 9 year old came downstairs this afternoon with a fuzzy blanket, curled up on the couch beside me and fell asleep. No words exchanged, just needed her momma and some shut eye.
"Had my first session (online - still in lockdown here) with a new tuition student who has been approved by her school for government funded one-on-one support (me!) to help her achieve her goal of getting the science grades she needs to become a vet. It went great and I am so stoked to be able to help her achieve her goals!

I lost lots of private students and thus lots of income when the UK gov cancelled exams this year, and it‚Äôs made me really happy to not just be picking up new work but to be able to help a kid who really needs it."
I gave away 25 tomato plants that I had started from seed back in March. The last three plants were picked up by a woman who had been searching high and low for plants for her grandfather. Apparently tomato plants are sold out completely in my area. I had no idea. She was so excited and thankful... I think I'll accidentally grow too many next year too.
My Covid test came back negative and I am cleared to return to work tomorrow with the rest of the opening team.   üôÇ
I work retail. An older couple came up to my register needing to order a TV. While the husband was finishing at the register, she said she was going to go across the road to a hardware store that also sells garden items. When she said that she was going, her husband guessed right off why she was going there. It was cute!
Happened yesterday but i was able to complete my machine learning assignment in 3 hours. It made me very happy and i felt like i achieved something.
"My best friend‚Äôs dog cuddling me. 

There hasn‚Äôt been a lot of happiness here lately. Her boyfriend was a former marine, and he lost his battle with PTSD on Memorial Day. She is heartbroken, and I am heartbroken for her. I‚Äôve been staying with her ever since, and my husband and I have agreed to pay for her therapy so she doesn‚Äôt have an excuse not to come. I was put on lithium recently so I can‚Äôt really feel anything about it. I haven‚Äôt cried a single time, and it is very frustrating."
I was reading on the porch in the sun and my cat was hanging out with me, she decided the best thing to do was sit on the page I was reading.
"I watched my cat looking outside :) she then made a really cute yawn after a minute and went to sleep on her cat perch

(I recorded it)"
"I found elastic at my local craft store! I'm going to teach myself how to sew and make masks. I'm hoping to stockpile some as I go back to teach in the fall.

I recently had a birthday and received a card from my grandma who wrote that she only learned how to sew when she went to work at a local company that sold men's dress pants. She gave me her new sewing machine during quarantine and I've been trying to find time to learn now that the school year is over."
"Ended a bad cycle of not cleaning my apartment for a week or so. Showered, shaved, did the dishes, vacuum cleaned and emptied my fridge.
Then I played a couple of games of Warzone with a good colleague of mine.

Now I'm listening to music and chilling without the feeling of being a useless dude."
Got a sudden downpour right as I pulled up to my place. It was the perfect excuse to stay in the car and sing loud to some favorite songs until the rain chilled out c:
"Sorry in advance this might be a bit long (TLDR at the bottom)

I work at a laundry in a nursing home, where I wash the patients clothing and towels. All of the patients are super nice, but I have to admit some of them are especially sweet and extremely precious and have earned a special place in my heart.

Today, arguably one of the sweetest old women came up to me specifically and asked if I could wash one of her favourite pairs of pants (I usually collect clothing collectively from each department). I told her of course I could.

Near the end of my shift, her pants washed and dried, I figured I‚Äôd return them to her as I was already on my way to the storage room which is right next to the department she lives in. I knocked on her door and told her I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt what she was doing, but I had washed her pants and wanted to return them. Her face instantly lit up and she even teared up a bit, thanked me at least 5 times and gave me a proper hug, all the while telling me she wanted to pay me for being so kind to her. I told her I did not want her money, and that just to see her happy is always enough for me! She teared up again, and so did I. 

She has already made my entire week :‚Äô)

TLDR: Had the most blessed interaction with a sweet old lady :‚Äô)"
Just found out I earned a promotion at work for hitting my monthly goals 3x in a row!! üéâ(excluding being closed in April for covid)

It‚Äôs small, but I get to work at my office tomorrow for the first time since the lockdown. My job means a lot to me and changed my life a ton in the few months I had it before the rona. I fully expect to tear up at least a little when I walk in even though it‚Äôs just gonna be me and one other person there. This made my day.
My 5 yo son learned how to make an origami whale. Now we have pods of origami whales across the house...

I made an appointment to get my learner‚Äôs permit. The DMVs in my state closed on literally the day that I was first eligible to get it, so needless to say, I was pretty frustrated.
So because we can‚Äôt go inside because of corona my trainer said that we could do volleyball on the beach. It made me really happy and we had a lot of fun.

Nothing but a good time even when conditions aren't the best. You just make the best out of it and give it a 100%!
"I listened to a podcast with my dad, its one that I usually listen to but he said he would listen to it with me today. 

Me and my dad are very similar people, we share the same ideologies, have the same compassionate and empathetic qualities. 

However, we don‚Äôt share the same interests. He‚Äôs big into aviation and history. Whereas I‚Äôm more into sport and music. I‚Äôm training to be a primary/elementary school teacher. I would say he has ten times the amount of intelligence of me but suffers with dyslexia and therefore is skeptical of the schooling system and methodologies used by teachers. 

Through no fault of his own, he is sensitive around the issue of learning new things and the acquisition of knowledge and he sometimes feels insecure when I talk about my interests and how I pick information up.

So when he asked me to listen to one of my podcasts with me today, it felt really great."
I got to see my neice. She is 11 and the first person I knew I would love unconditionally for the rest of my life. I haven't seen her in a couple months.

So i got home and was so excited that i went for a run. Then i cooked something nice for myself and drank a small beer in the evening sun. 

And all just because i pushed myself to go swimming."

Definitely made me smile."
"After being stuck in a job I hate for 4 years, feeling so miserable and trapped that I considered killing myself several times, I got accepted to college. I might not be able to afford to go right now but it feels like a door was opened instead of closed for once...and it feels so good. 

Thank you for asking. My boyfriend is military and had to leave suddenly yesterday so I haven't had anyone to tell or talk to. It feels good to tell someone."

"I was able to prove to my boomer mother that the news media only shows you what they want you to see. 

Good Morning America showed the clip on the video of that guy in DC smashing the sidewalk to throw rocks and cause trouble when a couple peaceful protesters stepped in and turned him over to the police. 

Only problem was that GMA only showed about a 2 second snippet of the police taking the guy into custody as he was fighting to get away causing the whole group to fall to the ground, but it appeared that the police were using unjustified force.

I showed her the full video and she understood."
"I babysat a little boy I had never met and by the end of the day if he'd look up and I wasn't around he'd say, ""Hey! C'mon!"" Also his hair was so spikey and cute."
My friend invited me to join his mc realm, and I found a really nice place to set up a base, and we planned it all out, and if I can get it right, it should look pretty awesome, so that's cool!

I had a slice of cake which was nice. I spoke to my family, friends, and bf. I had the day off work. My air conditioner made me feel really cosy in bed. I've washed my bedsheets so they'll be clean later. I had a cold shower which felt good. I made vegetables couscous for lunch and I thought the veg would taste bad because it did before but it was nice. I sat in the garden and sunbathed and a pretend to be came and investigated me, and when I was running, a pigeon did the same. Loads of good stuff happened.
It was just a quick trip to the store with my sister, but it was nice to have some one on one time. We just got to chat and laugh about whatever, which doesn't happen often, so it was nice.

A lovely bit of kindness that I really didn't deserve.

There was a song I found on youtube, I loved it. It was an underrated song, his channel had few subscribers. And there was no activity in that channel since 2013, he seemed really sad.

"Today I was toying with the idea of buying property somewhere in Africa and I came across this apartments that I used to walk by when I couldn‚Äôt afford 20cents for transport to the shopping center. I liked the walk anyway...but hated being hopeless. I couldn‚Äôt see a time when I could own an apartment like that.And there it was at very affordable price too. 
Thing about the road was it went through a forest that had a river that then led to my village. It was quite serene and the birthplace of most of my dreams."
"Technically yesterday, but it keeps popping back in my head today and is still funny. 

My husband dropped my birthday cake. Like on the floor, flipped over, squashed on the floor dropped. He was just saying how well it fit in the cake carrier with the fancy lid and handle. Then one of the latches failed and the cake just plopped down. I dont think I've ever laughed harder."

I recognized I was experiencing a prolonged manic episode, called my doctor, and followed her advice to take a rescue pill and delete my social media. I mostly follow wholesome content on Reddit, so I don't feel like this is one I need to delete.

I hugged my grandkids today for the first time since the virus started. We had all been playing it safe the whole time, staying home and away from each other. The kids are old enough to understand a germ is making people sick and have done very well, but that first hug, man, that was really nice.
A new client said she went with our company because of my professional speaking and great phone etiquette üòä
I was able to prove to my girlfriend that she does in fact leave the kitchen cabinet doors open after she grabbed a snack and didn't close the cabinet door.  According to her mom, she has done so her entire life. We had a good long laugh because she is completely oblivious to it and was shocked when I mentioned it a few days ago.
I‚Äôve been looking for a job since April and haven‚Äôt heard back from anyone until today. I have an interview scheduled!
"Hasn't happened yet but will later today.

I will finally be able to see my mum after her being locked in another country due to covid since late march. Her plane landed last night and I am alowed to go to her hotel to bring her some items.

She wont be able to come home for 2 weeks but it will be the best thing to happen since covid started"
My boyfriend has been active in his support for the BLM movement and has been more vocal about it now more than ever. He used to not get political online but he‚Äôs speaking up and I‚Äôm so proud of him.ü•∞
My home got new windows doors and siding-a project 5 years in the making and it happens to be my birthday.
I am taking a me day after 20-ish days. I'm 21 and I can feel my body screaming for rest as I just woke up. I'm in a bad shape damn
"I finally cracked home-schooling my daughter. (A lockdown thing)

Simple when you know how ‚Äî although she gives no clues, I twigged that she‚Äôs a morning person so stacked it all up heavily early on and let her gently relax and allow her concentration to stray later in the day."
"Watched a video of a girl who was fighting a disease that made her bald getting her first wig. She was so happy and it made me happy

Yeah that‚Äôs about it"
My bf is a psychology student and his experiment results are significant. He will send his article to some journals
Silly, but a box of jelly beans arrived today -- there is a certain type that I just love and I can only get them at Easter.  I found a place online that still had some,and they came today.  Happy me!
I went fishing with my two older brothers. They suddenly called and I just took my bike, a camping chair and some beers.
My roommates cat came and laid in my lap while I played video games before I had to leave for work. Tiny but very fluffy cat too
A man rescued a dog during the protest from tear gas.  The saving the dog part made me happy.  The protest made me sad.  We'll not the protest, but rather that cops are not held accountable and are above the law.
I finished my degree and saw my boyfriend for the first time in 3 months due to Lockdown restrictions. We had a barbecue to celebrate, home made cocktails and lots of laughs.
"My girlfriend's son was terrified of any kind of bug/creepy crawly when we met. I, on the other hand, have grown up obsessed with weird little critters, and I've been trying to get him past his fear for months now.

Today, we did a bug safari in the garden and he loved it. Even plucked up his courage enough to hold a woodlouse and a millipede. 

My girlfriend has given me the green light to build an ant farm for him."
I'm a teacher (8th grade; so 13-14 year Olds) and I had several students reach out to tell me they're thankful they had me as a teacher and are sad they couldn't finish the year in person and that they learned a lot. This year was a tough year for me and that meant so much.
I get to see my wife smiling. Nothing special happened, she just saw me come home and smiled. It always brightens my day ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I got to kiss my middle school crush that I never thought Id see again <3

Edit. Just to clarify I had a crush on her while we were both in middle school not that I have a crush on a middle schooler"
My toddler waddled up to me and kissed my leg while I was doing dishes. By the time I looked to see what touched me he was already walking away to his next adventure.
My daughter came up to me first thing this morning and gave me a big hug. Then when my husband woke up he did the same thing. I love that hugging me is their first thought in the morning ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I work at a state park and helped reunite a lost little kid with his family yesterday. A random park visitor posted on our Facebook page about it, saying we have a great park and great rangers. I‚Äôve only been here 2 weeks so it made me feel like I‚Äôm doing a good job, even though I‚Äôm still learning :)
Got new glasses.  My old ones were so scratched up, it was like looking through a thin layer of fog.  World is so friggin‚Äô bright now.
My job called me asking me if I can come in for a few hours tomorrow....I love my job and I had to call out Monday due to car troubles and felt bad (they were understanding) so any opportunity to come in and get extra hours is always a good thing
I‚Äôm drawing something rainbow in my sketchbook everyday this month to celebrate pride in quarantine üåà
"I always get to these late but...

NY Announced that summer camps can run starting at the end of June.

I work in child care for a before/after school program and had the last 3 months of the year taken and cut short due to COVID.

It hurt me of course because I've worked there a while and am close with the kids but people also don't realize what the programs mean to the kids and families, so I'm happy they'll be able to have some kind of experience outside of sitting at home all summer."
I was late getting up for work because I had an animal pile on me. My two cats were side by side on my left arm, one dog was in my right arm pit, and my other dog was across my feet. Both dogs were adopted in the last eight months so moments like these are super rare since everyone is still learning how to live peacefully. The only thing that would've made it better was if my husband hadn't left for work yet and was able to join us.
I googled ‚Äúdo a barrel roll‚Äù, on my mobile, and watched the site load as it did a 360 rotation.  I‚Äôm easy like that.
I leaned the song on guitar that made me really want to play guitar. It‚Äôs the into to nothing else matters if you‚Äôre curious.
One of my projects was featured in an article on Tom's Hardware. It's definitely nothing impressive but I was pretty happy with with it and did not expect it to be featured.
I got almost every IV I tried for today. I‚Äôm a paramedic and my second job is for a pain management/anesthesiologist. We do spine injections every other Tuesday that require anesthesia. Then at the end of the day he paid me for last shift and this shift together in cash since my direct deposit didn‚Äôt go through.
I got my daughter to understand why black lives matter is a thing rather than all lives matter. Good learning day.
My wonderful boyfriend, with whom I dont *always* see eye to eye on certain political issues, told me that if my friend (who is half black) is uncomfortable where he is living now or in his neighborhood, he is welcome to spend time or stay with us if it will help. My bf knows my friend and they get along great, but I didn't expect him to be supportive like that. It was sweet :,)
Bought a Tacoma!! Dream vehicle for me, been admiring them since I started driving and now I have to call my own.
"My peppers are finally sprouting :) 

Took them a little longer than I expected and was worried rabbits/moles may have gotten to them, but low and behold I‚Äôve got about a dozen different pepper plants popping up!"
"I am sitting in excited anticipation for my husband to get home. I texted him earlier that I cut my own hair and that I am really concerned about how short it is...

....shhhhhh! I‚Äôm wearing a cheap blonde bob wig. He is going to have a heart attack"
Waking up and have morning coffee with my granny. I appreciate being able to spend time with her and just being able to chat.
Passed my classes for the semester, after worrying about failing my finals for almost two weeks. Super happy, and pumped for the next semester!
The officers involved in the tazing and arrest of those Atlanta students are now facing criminal charges.
"It was my boyfriends birthday over the weekend and I finally gave him the gifts I had been hiding for almost two months. He showed up at my house today with both of them! 

(It was a smart-bottle and a new wallet if anyone is wondering)"
My husband and I moved out of my abusive mother's house after some unfortunate events landed us there. I sat and looked at our belongings on the bed of the place we are staying at and cried. I didn't know whether I was happy or sad. And I looked at my husband and he asked me if they were happy tears or sad tears and I shrugged and he told me we were gonna sit and he was going to hold me until I figured it out or until I felt better and as he held me he told me he was going to do his best to make me as happy as possible. The situation may be shitty but I'm so glad to be doing this with him. I know I'll be ok now that we're looking out for each other.
I made it to the next round of interviews for a manager role! I‚Äôve always been an analyst, ready to step up!
Girl I‚Äôm interested expressed interest in me. She is out of my league. Like miles out of my league. She doesn‚Äôt seem to realize/care. Probably going to mess it up.
Got my car back from the shop. It runs like brand new.   It‚Äôs great to have the Buick back on the road.
Not today, but over the weekend my wife and I finally told our family we‚Äôre expecting our first child
I just had one of the best chats with my crush. I open Reddit before going to bed and this is the first post I see. What a coincidence!
I planted my beginner garden on my patio with my girl! Sage, basil, peppers, tomatoes, parsley, and coriander :) üå±
I executed a PERFECT 3 point turn in the work truck today. I drive a dodge Challenger, and that thing is way smaller than the truck. Made me feel like a boss.
I met my 1 1/2 year old dog‚Äôs brother. My little Maltese/Shih Tzu and I went on a walk and saw his dogpelganger. When the dogs approached each other the two humans (who are the children of the people who received the puppies from eye parents) got to talking and realized that our little guys were from the same litter!! Fourteen years ago my Pekingese had puppies and I always wondered what it‚Äôd be like to see one of them later, and even though that never happened it was fun seeing my little buddy meet his brother!
My neighbor saw my outside struggling to get my lawnmower started. We‚Äôve never talked before but he‚Äôs a mechanic. He has my lawnmower in his garage working on it right now.
"My partner woke me up early to take me down to the middle of nowhere to get these little garden wagons I‚Äôve been wanting since March! All of this before he had to work. 

Happy is an understatement"
A friend of mine, who is pretty much the most awesome guy on the planet, said he met someone to date. He deserves nothing but great things so it made me immensely happy for him.
"I was making pizza dough and a bee flew all around me during the entire preparation.
I felt like she was hyping me up all along.
Was happy to have a little friend to keep me company."
I bought my first car! It‚Äôs an older model that‚Äôs been well-maintained, and I bought it in cash so I don‚Äôt have to worry about car payments, either.
I recently rebuild a bike from 1994 as a single speed monster cross bike. Took it out for a ride today, doing laps around the lake while my amazing wife ran around the same lake. Perfect weather too.
"My grandma called to check in and for some iPhone help. While chatting I mentioned that I absolutely adored the old pictures she‚Äôd recently given me and especially the ones of her on vacation in Greece. Apparently she hadn‚Äôt realized those were in the stack and the joy and surprise in her voice brought tears to my eyes. She offered to send more and seemed astounded when I immediately accepted. 

Happy achievement."
I asked my 95 year old patient to remove his shirt so I could do an EKG on him and he asked me if I had an dollar bills and then proceeded to whip his shirt around over his head once it was off. My man still got it at 95!
I‚Äôve had four orgasms, three one hour naps, and ate a bag of yogurt covered pretzels for breakfast. It‚Äôs not even 2pm üôàüòÇ
Today i finished organizing family photos i recovered from a drive that crashed. I originally recovered about ten years ago, and they've been sitting unsorted since then. The photos are 15-20 years old and ready to be archived again!
Some animal crossing things. I got a piece of furniture in which looks great in my restaurant, and my sister got many sharks
"Someone I have a crush on called me cute .. literally today. Feeling pretty good.

To put the conversation into context.

Her ""Are you sure you're not gay?"" (Joking)

Me "" ... Yeah I'm probably gay.""

Her ""Well a lot of gay guys like you are really cute""

Me *fucking brain dead laugh*"
"- cashier eye contact had some love in it, a drip bit it was a pretty drip

Idk if I helped him get out of it he said I did-"
"I met a friend in need of a pick-me-up.
I gave her a hug and brightened her whole day.
Making other people feel good makes my day."
my boyfriend and i work the same job, but i usually get out of bed before him, waking him up in the process. some mornings he says ‚Äúno!‚Äù and bear hugs me and it is very cute. this morning was one of those mornings.
"I got $100 to do what I want with!
And I've been making a list of gardening stuff to pick up that I've started going through!"
"I painted for the first time in over a year. I had no expectations for my skill. It came out beautiful!

Also, my lizard was being *really* cute and I got a perfect picture before he moved. Exciting stuff."
My father is on his way home.  He's a truck driver who has been working nonstop since the coronavirus situation started.  This will be the first time he's been home in months.  I'm just praying he makes it safe before he's mugged by rioters.
I made dinner and dessert. After that I watched Interstellar with my mom. It's probably one of my favorite movies now.
My grandmother winked at me and joked a little bit. She's still resolved to beat cancer. She might not win, but she's fighting as hard as she can which is all I want.
I‚Äôm not feeling too well today. This morning my dog knew I wasn‚Äôt feeling well. He‚Äôs been in bed with me all day taking care of me.
Our pregancy genetic testing results finally came in today. We were supposed to have them back last week but they screwed something up and had to redo it so it's been a hard wait. They found no high risk factors for the major genetic disorders and we found out we are having a GIRL! No one in our families know yet and we can't wait to surprise them.
My entire fence line was replaced with a beautiful, sturdy, bright new fence! I had to get over my fear of talking to my neighbors to get this done and I‚Äôm so grateful to now know them better.
My wife wakes up later than me, so I cut some flowers out of the garden, put them in a cup and onto her night stand. I smiled from the smell, and then about two hours later when she sent me a sexy nude photo. It‚Äôs the little things üòä
My partner just texted and told me he's bringing me home a new stuffed toy!! I'm super excited, he calls it a new edition to my stuffed army.
I don‚Äôt really have anything in common with my brother and we rarely see each other but today i was helping him renovate his and his familys new home. We laughed up and were happy to see our unexperienced asses put my nieces room together perfectly on the first try with floorings, wallpapers, ceilings and such. Went to get some chicken nuggets after that. It was a fun day.
My therapist coached me through how to quit the job I hate while coming out on top. I‚Äôve been waiting to quit for so long but didn‚Äôt know how to go about it!
I had to talk to someone over the phone to cancel my verizon service for the place I just moved out of and the person on the phone was very friendly and we had a nice chat while he took care of everything.
For the first time ever I wore shorts at the beach!!! My legs are full of self harm scars so today was AWESOME
"My oldest daughter is both potty training and transitioning to a toddler bed, and she‚Äôs really happy/proud, so I am happy and proud. 

My youngest pooped and it all stayed in the diaper. That also made me happy."
"I was grabbing a drink from the grocery store this morning, and as I walked by two female employees, I heard one say to the other; ‚Äúhe has beautiful blue eyes.‚Äù 

I‚Äôve never been complimented like that, at least not that I‚Äôve heard."
Well I looked at the flat I wanted to rent for years but I'm a little pessimistic now because of my brothers credit history
Going over budget on a friends birthday gift intentionally and telling them I got it on sale so it was still in budget
I shaved another 14 seconds off of my best time.  I‚Äôve decided to run 1 km every day because I never work out, and in 1 week, I‚Äôve gone from 6:16 to 5:38.
A bird finally landed close enough to our patio that my cats could sit and chirp at it! They had a good day today:)
My 84 year old neighbor got a good report from her doctor today. She had a blood pressure scare on Mother's day but now she's doing great!
The final season of Fuller House came out. I know people shit on the show a lot but I really enjoy the sappy family story.
I have my daughter (4yr old) with me for 2 weeks for the first time since lockdown started and we had a water pistol fight with the majority of the neighbourhood so she could play with the other kids here and still be 2m away from them. Her laughs made my heart smile.
The one friend that I take for an example on how to be better in life told me today that I‚Äôm a source of inspiration for him. It feels good to know your doing good at doing your best.
I‚Äôve been absolutely slammed at work, doing 60-70 hours a week and we just found someone who actually WANTS to work and I have my first day off in 4 months on Sunday.
The coffee lady told me I had a nice smile :) which was nice because it was the first compliment I have received in a long time
We were having a 'Socially distanced' bbq at the neighbours house and the dogs started paying a lot of attention to one corner of the garden. Went over and saw a hedgehog! Pretty rare sight in the UK.
"I'm building a bathroom and I put all the drywall on today. Mud and taping tomorrow. I see light at the end of the tunnel baby and it feel so good. Currently celebrating with a beer. 


Cheers strangers"
My mom bought me a new pair of shoes, I‚Äôm 19 years old and like I rarely get financial support from them so I was very happy.
After an exhausting day of work, I had a jug of strawberry üçìüçã lemonade in my fridge/ freezer- perfect ice cold temp and slushy texture. SO. DAMN. GOOD.
I did the Boiler tests at work and didn't have to adjust any of the chemicals for the first time like ever, that was awesome! haha
Even though I‚Äôve been home for a couple months because of quarantine, today‚Äôs my last official day of high school and technically my graduation
"Okay. So. I‚Äôm in a group of friends. We‚Äôve been friends for about 15 years now. One of them hit rock bottom recently. Mentally and physically. The rest of us began to worry. And concerning him, that means something. We tried to reach him in any possible way thinkable. But we couldn‚Äôt. We even thought about giving up on him. Because we eventually got the feeling that there‚Äôs nothing we could do. Today, he finally broke the silence that was surrounding him. Told us about his problems and the situation. It was a lot to take in. It was hard. But at the end of the day, we spun some records, had a laugh and drank some beers. He‚Äôs on his way up. And so are we. Today was a good day.

Edit: happy cake day!"
Watched some videos of cops protesting with the protesters. It‚Äôs good to see something positive for a change
People posting the black squares on Instagram. I love to see such a unity among people in such a divided time. :)
I have a 13 week old Great Dane puppy and seeing how excited  her and my wife is when I got home from work makes everything seem okay. We all need to put out a lil extra love

My son came over to me and his fathers apt for the first time today and got to spend time with us and his little brother , without CPS or my family members shadowing over us all.. ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm filled with joy
My tomato plant had tomato fruit. I‚Äôve never done gardening before. Made me really happy. I‚Äôve been so worried about accidentally killing it that I‚Äôve been checking up on it literally every day.
I saw my whole city stand up and march for justice against police brutality and the murder of innocent black lives, all lives matter.
I woke up late to my fat cat curling up beside me waiting for his breakfast. It‚Äôs so cute when he practically half sleeps on me lol
This guy came into the restaurant I work at on accident. He meant to go next door but he came back 2 minutes later to order something. He was nice to talk to while I had to clean.
"My girlfriend has been going through a tough time recently and one of her friends had a small pizza and fries delivered to our house completely out of the blue. Its something small and silly but really made her day and it was great to see.

Also got to partake in eating it so that made me happy too."
"Backstory: I read the Warriors series in third grade. Then, my library only had the original covers. A few years later, the updated the covers to make them more modern and fit in with a typical middle grade/ young adult audience. The new covers are fine and I received those ones for Christmases and birthdays. But I‚Äôll always be nostalgic for the originals. 

Today: I was curious. I was planning on replacing my old Harry Potter paperbacks with the hardbacks. I knew the old Percy Jackson covers were hard to find, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting to find the old Warrior covers. But I did...and let out an audible ‚ÄúY E S‚Äù"
"I ran 8km.  I started a ""couch to 5k"" in February.  I'm now working on 5k to 10k.  That is so much further than I've ever run in my life."
Today is my birthday and despite all of the stress and anxiety with being a front line healthcare worker in Chicago right now, receiving calls/texts from friends and family really made my birthday amazing! They have lifted my spirits that have been suffering for months. I‚Äôm very fortunate and can‚Äôt stop smiling!
I finished AP exams. I took the last one today. Never taking them anymore since I just finished high school. Finally free from College Board
My friend that I haven‚Äôt talked to in a while sent me a message saying how happy they were to have me in their life
I got to drive to work to fix an issue with my computer password not updating. But I got to go to the building for the first time since March. This means I also got to be alone for an hour for the first time since March.
"I started a new job at a craft/fabric supply store after 3 years of being unemployed and a history of bullying and harassment in the workplace. 

I was straightening the last row of satin fabrics when my supervisor walked down the aisle and asked ‚Äúdid you do all this?‚Äù I suddenly worried that I may have done something wrong but she smiled and said ‚Äúit looks beautiful, great job!‚Äù 

That little acknowledgement was more encouragement than I got in 4 years of my previous employment. I was so happy."
"My two best friends where not talking to each other since March due to an arguement.

One of them told me earlier today that they were back in good terms."
I woke up this morning with a nice camper outside my family's house that I bought yesterday (I'm 21 and I own my own a camper!!)! I think I aced my math exam today! And I thought I had homework due tonight, but I don't! And my birthday's tomorrow!
I feel ugly and today a random girl passing by in a group said beautiful boy to me.( I was the only boy around ) I don't know if it was to laugh at my face ironically but I still liked the compliment. :)
I gave a presentation with my group in online class today and we fucking crushed it! The professor said he was really impressed that we were able to get testing done during quarantine. These past few weeks have been rough with school work but hearing him congratulate us after we put in the work felt so fucking good.
"I've been in a shit place for weeks now
Job sucks, chaotic home life and my back hurts. I always look forward to onion rings from this little mom and pop shop with a diner down the road. They've been out of those... until today. Eating those while crying in the car really made me happy."
I got to take my doggy into work today, he hasn‚Äôt been feeling good and found out he might have eaten a bunch of baby wipes that he can‚Äôt pass. I asked my boss if I would bring him in just in case he needed to go to the bathroom.
I had a pleasant conversation with a customer ( we call them guests at Target) and something as simple as that really made a difference.
"I work at my old school, and one of my old maths teachers who I used to think was terrifying but is actually lovely said she thinks I‚Äôve lost weight since working from home. 

Feels good ya know."
A Mickey Mouse plush came in the mail today... and it made me feel really happy, kind of a way to forget what‚Äôs going on in life right now.
I'm starting to notice I'm getting better at working out at home. No visible results yet though but I'm still happy about it.
"I got a Religious waiver in the Air Force that allows me to openly observe my Sikh faith. I've been waiting a year for it to get approved, and it just did.

Saying I'm happy is an understatement."
I laughed really hard during a phone call with my girlfriend. Laughing with others, especially someone you respect and care about is so good.
I got contacted by my dream company that the hiring freeze was lifted for a few positions and that they're moving forward with me. :) Now it's just the technical interview
"My twenty minute phone call to remove the hold on my bank account wasn't that bad. The guy on the other end was super pleasant, little did he know I just had the worst mental breakdown in months.

Thanks, guy."
I fixed the broken screen on my phone. The LCD display was cracked on the backside, after a battery-bloating failure. Managed to get it all disassembled myself (with help from a bit of google-fu), and installed the new display, and now it's working perfect again. Saved about 100 dollars.
Was able to get home from work during a pandemic without protestors blocking me from getting home safely.
I made a complete fool of myself and laughed harder than I have all year. Was texting my boyfriend and a complete stranger at the same time. The stranger was coming over to pick up something I had listed on Craigslist. My boyfriend and I were teasing each other back and forth and I sent him a racy text. Or, I thought I did...the horror I felt as I realized I just sent the message intended for my boyfriend to a random person on the way to my house was the stuff of nightmares! I have never texted an apology so fast. The person was cool and now has a funny story and I laughed at myself and have been chuckling all day every time I think of it. Could have been an awful mess; but, instead I got a chance to let go a little, not take myself too seriously, and not think about all the other crap going on for a few minutes.
My sister told me I was going to be an aunt. I don‚Äôt know how to treat kids but I‚Äôm excited for having the opportunity of teaching him/her things and to educate him/her,to teach her child more languages, to help her/him with maths and other subjects. I barely know how to hold a baby but I‚Äôll wait to be useful in the future, to help that kid to be happy when grown. It‚Äôs the only reason that keeps me going this year.
"Ohhhh I got a good and shitty one.

My family supports, pretty much as a whole, Bolsonaro, the fascist president of Brazil. I posted something in support of Antifa yesterday, and my mother and grandmother came to ""lecture"" me (mind you I'm a 29 year old lawyer studying Economics). Eventually my grandmother said ""You're risking your life, what if someone kills you over this post?"" ""Then I guess it proves me right."" and walked out of the room.

F U C K F A S C I S M"
My neighborhood birds finally started eating out of the bird feeder my girlfriend and I spent hours painting. It's been hung up with various bird seeds for a few days, and from what I've seen they haven't touched it- until today!
I met my dormitory friends after 2 and a half months of quarantine! We enjoyed a nice evening together with drinks and good stories!
I had a client specifically mention me in a positive review for my company‚Äôs BBB. It made me feel really appreciated!
A lot makes me happy. Even through all of the ugliness, I still find joy through my Faith, my marriage, and of course my pretty 2 month old daughter. Blessed beyond description.
My boss made me a loaf of banana bread because, and I quote, ‚Äúworking on your mental health is hard, but I want you to know it‚Äôs not going unnoticed, so I made you banana bread.‚Äù
I went on a walk in the park! It's beautiful outside and I haven't gotten to do it before. I loved it!
Finally got to take my ASVAB and came out with a 130 GT score, I'm hoping for something in Cyber Ops so I'm glad I got a decent score :)
It happened yesterday but some random middle aged guy in the grocery store told me I looked fantastic and I was absolutely killing it. Really made my day.
Brought my new born baby boy home from the hospital. Amongst the hate and violence in the world right now, we have this joy in our lives. I couldn‚Äôt be happier
It was show your plant day today at work, I dressed up in a ghillie suit, said I had no plant so I am a plant, and got to brighten the day of all my virtual co-workers üòä
Yesterday I showed a pic I saw on reddit to my 6 year old granddaughter. It was of a 'doggosaur'. Today I got a text from her mother thanking me SO much for convincing her child that there ARE doggosaurs because grandpa showed her one. She had the opportunity to share her newfound knowledge with her class! The teacher handled it well, thanking her for her addition. I laughed my butt off! I think it was the combination of daughters frustration and granddaughters absolute trust in all I say, so sweet! They make my heart glad!
Had my second interview for a new job. Got fired right before this covid shutdown happened. This was my first 2nd interview that I've gotten so far
I took my best friend shopping for a wedding dress! She was really nervous because she‚Äôs never tried one on before, but now she‚Äôs confident in the type of dress she wants!
I was able to assemble my desk without any help. I'm usually too weak to do anything, so this was a win!
We closed on our first home today :) as someone who spent her childhood moving to a new house every other year, I cried when we got the keys
I won an online raffle for a brand new car, 20k cash and fuel for a year. Today also marks the 4 week countdown until my first child is born, life is good.
Got to talk to my brother on the phone. It's always nice when I get to talk to him and our conversations flow well.
I turned 22 years old. Nothing special but just thankful to still be alive and healthy. Happy my friends are too.
Absolutely fucking nothing, my pc keeps boot looping and i discovered that i need to replace my motherboard
I ordered a fuck ton of snack food off walmart's pickup app and then when I brought it home I got drunk and ate a shit ton of it while watching youtube.
Saw a goose and said hi and waved as I was driving and it happened to flap its head up and down 2 times at me, his head turned and I drove by.
My brother-in-law is hospitalized with heart trouble.  My sister just let the rest of my family know he‚Äôs going to be okay.
My husband u/ironhidefire and I tried to play tennis, we sucked at it but we got out. Then we went on a walk and delivered a package to a neighbor a street over that was incorrectly delivered to our house and that felt nice. Every little bit of positive karma always makes me feel happier.
Today is my birthday and I grew up in a jw household so I've never had someone say happy birthday, but a friend did today. Little thing but it was nice :)
I wrote 456 words into my novel seamlessly in one go, and that's the most I've done in one go this week.
Had less than 5 dollars left to my name and my unemployment finally went through. 6 weeks of back payed unemployment came in today totaling 3500 dollars. I can finally pay my rent and buy food again.
"I stopped a car from backing into another in a very busy drive thru by laying on my horn. Both drivers were distracted.
Ain't nobody got time for that."
My son, in gr4, who has struggled so much in school (adhd/odd)is winning an award for most improved and best independent work. He's worked so hard and I couldn't be more proud :)
"Unfortunately it was another day where happiness seems to evade me at all points. 

I worry that the chronic lack of these days will compel me to apathy :(

Edit: after a few minutes of reading some of the top comments, I‚Äôve had my first happy of the day. Thanks y‚Äôall."
I had a great day grocery shopping with my wife. Been married 12 years and it's been way too long since we've had this much fun together.
My grandpa had heart surgery today and it was successful. He's quite old, so it's a relief that he made it through without any trouble.
I went on a bike ride, and ate extremely clean. First time getting back on my health kick since covid-19 shut everything down...
My family took in a homeless woman for a few days who was in Washington during the riots.. it‚Äôs been interesting to hear her stories.
Stupid but these chewy Chips Ahoy brownie cookies. It's a chocolate chip cookie with a brownie Center. These are my new jam LOL.
I finally moved into a 1bedroom apt from a 3 bedroom cus money, and it took 13 hours to move, my body is so sore but this feeling of being done while im recovering is the best
I actually fell asleep,,, we don't talk about how i was only able to do that during the day just be happy i slept at some point.
I filled up a baby pool with water for my dog. Sat outside, drank some tea, put my feet in the water and watched him jump in and out of the pool and play. Tomorrow is his 3rd birthday. He brings so much joy to my life.
Mine doesn't seem to be original in this thread, but I voted for the first time today! The process was way easier than I expected, but I suppose a big part of that is most people did mail-in ballots.
My best friend in another country visited my newish Animal Crossings NH island and gifted me 2 million Bells and a bunch of furniture.
"This is a amazing question. So I am going to Ask my friends and give you their response, because they don‚Äôt have reddit :) 

Me: I finally got my screen replaced and I get to do it with my dad, gave us some bonding time.

Maddy: ‚Äúi‚Äôm getting chicken wings‚Äù

Kylie: ‚Äúmy sister found an old cd that i though was funny‚Äù

Hayden: ‚ÄúI got to talk with you and I went swimmingü•∫‚Äù"
"I sat on my balcony and fell asleep in the sun while listening to summer music.

It makes me feel so good I feel like I can take on the world."
"I own an online business and added my voice to the black out Tuesday movement on social media. Two people decided to attack me for my views (that law enforcement should have oversight and be held to a higher standard, and also that no one should ever feel scared for their lives when they step outside their door... Etc) a couple of people attacked me for my stance, one told me I should be ashamed and one told me my opinions are totally one sided and she would never buy anything from me again.

I went to bed feeling a bit shitty but when I woke up I had a whole slew of messages of support for my stance and for saying it as a business. It made me happy to realise I am not a total nut bag for my opinions - which were actually based on research I did for a law paper last year so peer reviewed and all. Anyway this hit me with the warm fuzzys this morning and I'll be happy all day now.


Eta - I wasn't jumping on I've been silent on sm for a few days when normally I post every single day sometimes a lot, and I wanted people to know why. Giving space to this historic movement and watching listening and learning is more important than anything I would ever have to say but also my customers and friends are used to hearing from me so letting them know is why I posted."
I had put some canned cat food up on freecycle.org  It's my cat's brand but they didn't like the flavor.  So I wanted to hand it off to someone who would use it.  The nice man who picked up the cat food brought my three kitties a huge thing of cat treats as a thank you!
"I got a very large and unexpected back payment of child support. The timing has never been better. 

What happened to you today, kind internet stranger?"
Went back to my childhood home to pick up a package that got accidentally delivered there.  Just happened to get there as my old neighbor was walking her two retrievers, whom I hadn‚Äôt seen since they were puppies.  Got the pet them and catch up.  It was peaceful and wonderful.
My husband! He makes me laugh every single day. He gives me goofy looks, sometimes breaks out into dances, coordinates long secret handshakes with me... He just poured me wine while I wrapped up my last meetings of the day, all the while he‚Äôs cooking up a spinach/mushroom/onion alfredo. I just love him.
"After nearly a year of unemployment and gig jobs i finally got an offer to move across the country and make good, livable money. They company is even paying for my plane ticket and is housing me for the first month.

I never thought id ever get a job with perks like that."
"My fianc√©e and I recently split. It was awful. 

There were good reasons too though. Problems with her family. I had issues from my family and childhood that were starting to surface and affect us as a family. 

I got therapy. Found out I was carrying so much baggage from how I was raised. Was carrying around so much anxiety that I didn‚Äôt even know was there. I just thought it was normal to have narcissistic parents and be a constant ball of stress and anxiety and worry. 

I changed so much, and thankfully she‚Äôs seen it. She‚Äôs changed too, both of us for the better. 

We both agree we weren‚Äôt ready before and rushed things because that‚Äôs what everyone told us we were supposed to do. 

But we know we love each other. And she knows that I love her kids as if they were my own, and they love me just as much in return. 

Her family is religious, and since I‚Äôm not part of their religion that will be a conflict, even though she‚Äôs not religious either anymore. They‚Äôre her best friends and important to her. 

To answer your question though:

Today I came over to help her out with a few things. She went to have dinner with her mom, but kissed me for the first time soncw we split and asked me to be here when she got back. She wants this to work. To try this again. Just a lot slower than before. 

I have a chance at having my family back again, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Life is all about chances, and I won‚Äôt waste this one."
I cut off a toxic friend and finally stood up for myself. Afterwards I reconnected with a mutual friend who had just done the same and we spent the afternoon telling each other stories about the shit our TF put us through.
It might not sound as bombastic as some other replies in this thread, but I got to spend some chill time with my SO, and that always makes me happy!
"I‚Äôm a parcel courier and a woman told me how much she appreciates what I do. I wasn‚Äôt even delivering a package to her. Be nice to your delivery person, it‚Äôll make their day!

Edit: and No! I don‚Äôt know where your package is!"
I was coming home from work and saw a random guy dressed up as the red power Ranger riding his bike down Main Street. üòÇ
I was able to see my boyfriend, even if it was for a short period of time. He always knows how to make my day better.
I put an offer on my first house and it got accepted and taken off the market today! 5 years ago I would never have believed I'd be able to do this on my own.
A friend came out to me as trans and she said I made her feel really safe and valued. She also said was grateful with how relaxed I was and how I asked how she would want to be referred to and what not. Felt nice man.
"My stepdad supporting me for wanting to move out.
Hes the best man I know to this day and hes been so very supportive of me throughout. Im glad hes more accepting and patient. Dont know what id do without him"
I finally finished cleaning the house. Been in a mental funk for a while so it's nice to have a clean space.
Being greeted by adult Chinese students (who are learning English) with intros such as We stand with America, we support the change and a mumbled Fight the Power this morning.
Technically a couple days ago but it continues to make me happy. Bought my girlfriend a rabbit for her birthday, due to the lockdown I had to keep a hold of him for a couple days but when I finally got to give her the rabbit her reaction was priceless, she sends me pictures and videos of them together all day and I think he‚Äôs really helping with her mental health. So that keeps a smile on my face.
My teenage daughter came outside and hung out with me AFTER telling me how lucky she was that I am smart with school stuff. (I worked as a math teacher and tutor for many years before moving into administration). I have helped her a lot with schoolwork this year.
A student told me I was their favorite English teacher they ever had and somehow made writing essays less daunting and more fun :)
I harvested my first crop of the season in my small garden, probably about $10-15 worth of food. Makes me happy.
Discovering my manager decided one day to put little ‚ÄúYeet‚Äù stickers in hidden locations throughout my workplace. Every time I stumble across one now it makes me smile. They‚Äôre so silly, childish and unexpected but damn it they make me happy
I went (social distance) kayaking in a brand new kayak with my best friend who I haven‚Äôt seen in months!
I‚Äôm 25 and finally learnt how to ride a bike today. I got on one for the first time ever three days ago and eventually cracked it today lmao. Ngl it was really awesome.
My best friend is helping me work out. He‚Äôs a very athletic gymnastics coach. I‚Äôm a potato. A very large potato. A 385 lb potato. But two weeks ago I was a 395 lb potato. Today he pushed me harder than I ever pushed before. It was so hard but I never ever thought I was capable of doing what I did today. That made me happy and proud of myself and thankful to him.
Honestly absolutely nothing. It‚Äôs been a miserable day but seeing others have nice moments has cheered me up tremendously.
"My husband never buys me a birthday present or Christmas present. It used to break my heart; I thought he didn‚Äôt care. And today I realized: my husband never buys me gifts for holidays, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt buy me gifts. Every time he runs out to do errands, he always brings me my favorite drink. Sometimes he‚Äôll come with a random bag of snacks he saw that he thought I‚Äôd like. When I get grouchy or I have a bad day or it‚Äôs the middle of the night and I‚Äôm hungry, he will get up and go get me whatever I want even if he‚Äôs tired too. He lets me pick where we eat EVERY TIME. He always randomly buys me orchids because they‚Äôre my favorite flower. I was angry at him today and he walked in with a case of beer he thought I‚Äôd like.

Today I learned that while I thought my husband didn‚Äôt care, it was just that I didn‚Äôt understand his love language."
Holding my little dog really near me and watching her scan everything outside from the window, she is just so happy by doing that! :)
Saw one of my patients who came in for knee surgery running in the rain. Made me proud that I did that, I helped fix her when she couldn‚Äôt barely walk.
"I got to lift weights in a gym again.  First time in almost 3 months.  Yeah, yeah, ""you meatheads don't care about the pandemic you just want to workout"".  Nah man, lifting weights is a major boon to my mental health.  I ain't an elite bodybuilder or powerlifter, it's just something I love to do.  I've had so many negative days during this shutdown due to not being able to do a thing I truly enjoy.  But I'm back now and I'm feeling great... Although I'm going to be very sore tomorrow."
My boss gave me a voucher to spin a wheel to get a random gift card. The guy at HR let me just pick what gift card I wanted and I choose 25$ at Mcdonalds. Should have picked the Fred Meyer gift card but I can't be unhappy with free fast food.
"I went to a friend yesterday and she let me borrow a bunch of children's books in Dutch so I could read more to help me learn and I read one of the books today!

I read De Gruffalo (The Gruffalo, in English), which is a book my parents read to me in Hebrew when I was younger. It's a really simple and repetitive book, but I learned a few words and had fun trying to read it out loud with different voices, which made getting the pronounciation and accent right difficult

Tomorrow I'll read it again to make sure that I still know all the new words and then go look for the book in Hebrew, which I really hope we still have"
Got to go back to work after being furloughed for over 2 months. Seeing my coworkers again has definitely lifted my spirits amidst everything going on right now
It wasnt as hot/humid as I was expecting for my walk home from work. It was still pretty toasty out, but I was expecting to be dripping sweat by the time I got home.
I texted my friend and asked her if she has ever had a pickled cucumber, she said no. Later I asked her if she has ever had a pickle and she said she has.
Someone who I thought randomly ghosted me last week messaged me and apologized - I was able to articulate to them how they wronged me, and how it made me feel and they were able to understand and we were able to make a resolution.
It‚Äôs my first year on the football team and the coach told me I‚Äôm doing really well for my first year. I know it‚Äôs small but it made my day
Mowed my lawn. Always feel really accomplished and proud even though it's not complicated and I do it all the time. Makes me feel pretty good every time.
I just woke up, I had work all night. But that I got to talk to the love of my life today. Even though I scared him because he thought I ghosted him. (My phone died)
The last DnD session of our minicampaign is in an hour and one of my exes is in a happy relationship.
My dogs attacked me with licks and then went on an all out battle for who gets to lick my face, the saga Continues as they are currently still at war
I graduate high school today, I just deposited the largest paycheck I‚Äôve ever gotten, and I‚Äôm about to work a shift with my best friend tonight.
On my drive to work I saw an elderly couple taking an early morning walk and holding hands. Somehow it lifted my spirits.
When I woke up I was laying in bed, thinking how wonderful an iced coffee from Dunkin‚Äô Donuts would be. I was really dreading driving there to get it though. When I got up and walked into the kitchen, my boyfriend had already gotten me coffee and a sandwich from Dunkin.
My dog and I motorcycled to the dog beach and there were a bunch of kids protesting. We honked and waved, and they all flashed us the peace sign back. Then it was low tide at the beach and we had [so much fun](http://www.calamarichris.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170924_Nena-DogBeach06.jpg) running around in the shallow water.
I work as a jokey so I back in trailers and there was a truck that was kinda blocking a dock door I was using. The truck driver saw that and moved to the other side of the lot and out of my way without me asking. What a nice guy :)
My 14 month old laughed out loud. He‚Äôs not very verbal but today I heard him laughing with his siblings.
I had surgery for the first time as well as going under anesthesia for the first time and I survived. It was only gallbladder surgery but I was really scared
Today was my youngest daughter's first birthday! Seeing her destroy her cake with the biggest smile on her face just makes you forget about all the bad things going on in the world for a little while.
I stayed up all night talking to my friend and she texted me at around noon today telling me that she was having a bad day and that I helped put her in a better mood, I had no idea she was having a bad day I just wanted to talk to herü•∫
My neighbors 9 y/o daughter offered to watch my 4 y/o so I had more time to study for my exam. It's obviously a symbiosis because she'd be bored out of her mind without any company, but it really gave me the break I needed to focus on my work.
Started my own business in late January. Today I got 3 new prospective clients, had a really good online meeting with one in a different city (would be a big statement project!), and one that is ready to buy a big order. The past few weeks have been insane - My pipeline was pretty much dried up aside from current accounts, and in the past 2 weeks I've added 10 new opportunities.
 Today I found a old movie that I loved as a little kid (still a kid technically) but I love this movie and I‚Äôm so happy to be watching it again (the movie I‚Äôm talking about it ponyo)
My mother's late birthday present finally came in from the mail. I've gotten her a Nintendo Switch Lite, along with Animal Crossing New Horizons. She literally said that she shouldn't have it but I basically had to shove it in her hands because it's literally hers now.
Had a pulmonology test this morning. Had a fun time chatting with the technician about being a zookeeper and martial arts. He was a cool guy and was interested in learning some ecology facts.
My boyfriend and I are having perfect couple of days after we had two very difficult months and today we were having great connection. Nothing particular, nothing major, we didn't even have time to see each other, but we're finally functioning as we should and it's beyond amazing!
"Dad and I just put our first ever batch of jerky in the oven to dry.
Looking forward to a delicious treat at the end of the day!"
I went shopping and went through every single aisle in the supermarket. And I was able to buy a washing machine. So happy to get out of the house and to be able to buy a washing machine. I‚Äôve been wanting to buy one for so long
Such a small thing but I had an interview for a job today. Been in a real slump the past 2 months and it felt great to get ready and dress to impress.
"Before this COVID shit, I would volunteer at a cat shelter (my mom is terrfied of cats, so getting one is impossible).
I was telling my friend about how I missed the cats, and she sent me a bunch of pictures of her cats and a couple days later she sent me a picture of this adorable ginger they found abandoned in the park. Made my fucking day.
Also motivated me to save up to get my own cat when I move for college (I'm planning to register it as an emotional support animal)."
"I hit my first 10 lbs lost mark. I weighed in at 245, 3 weeks ago and this morning I weighed 234.7. 

I have always tried dieting and exercise but lose hope and quickly lose and gain back the same 10 lbs and have never gotten below 235 before. Today, that changed."
Found out I'm going to be moving in with my girlfriend. For months we've been house hunting and just found out our home application got approved earlier today!!
I was able to confront a person who lost my headphones over 2 years ago so they will pay for them. It took me that long to speak, but today I did it.
My dad called me and we spent approx 45 minutes laughing, telling jokes and planning on having a beer tomorrow after he get off work and start his 3 month vacation.
I learned how to mow a lawn today. It sounds kinda stupid but I had some quality time with my dad. It was nice.

A classmate told me on a video call that my piano playing filled a place in his soul. He was probably joking, but it still makes me happy
"Found out my great grandma would have agreed with me on my opinion of baby showers.

I think it's stupid to have the shower before the baby is born. Anything can happen up until the birth, so why have a big party before everything is 100%? I mean, don't count all your chicks till they hatch, right?

Baby showers should be after the baby is born. Yeah, sure, anything can still happen, but the odds are far less.

Turns out, my great grandma used to bitch and complain at baby showers because she felt the same way I do.

I'm glad to know her blood runs in my veins."
It's not much but I got some receipt paper and made a paper sword. It made me so happy for some reason
"I saw one of my best friends in person for the first time in 3 months.

As if that wasn‚Äôt good enough, he brought homemade cupcakes with him."
"I got accepted to university with a 7000 Euro's scholarship!

For an international student I do feel lucky."
I deleted Facebook and Instagram, freeing me from yet another social media that took up time in my day
My friend wasn‚Äôt really into BTS but I really was, so I respected her opinion and didn‚Äôt really talk about them, but today she texted me with a video they posted the other day and she said ‚Äòthis is so funny!‚Äô So that really made my day knowing she went out of her way to watch one of their videos and genuinely enjoyed it. :)
My mom suprised me with homemade strawberry milkshake. Just strawberries, milk and sugar. Shes precious.
I found the tv series I‚Äôve been looking for on Blu-ray! It‚Äôs been out of stock everywhere I looked, but a neighbor was selling their copy.
I bought a new bed for the first time in my life. It‚Äôs being BUILT and delivered in a couple of weeks. I turn 40 in 6 months. It‚Äôs another ‚Äúadult‚Äù thing I‚Äôve knocked off the checklist. I may be alright after all.
Me and my brother are building porch stairs in our front yard! Its something that we're first timing but its fun doing it!
My son copied a noise for the first time ever. He is four.  We are trying not to get our hopes up too much that it wasn't a fluke but it makes me so happy I want to cry.
I finally met my neighbor. Her name is Joyce. She's 83 and lives alone. Super sweet, loves flowers. I'm gonna put a card in her mailbox with my cell number in case she ever needs anything.
I celebrated my third anniversary with my amazing wife. We're 30 now but have lived together since we were 20, got married in 2017. We evaluated our marriage together today on a dinner date and came to the conclusion that in all of our years we've never felt our love slowing down. I still get butterflies when I think of her, and I'm very blessed to not only have found the love of my life, but to have done so very early in it.
I got a job! I've been looking for months so this was a HUGE break for me. I am so relieved its unbelieveable.
Me and my girlfriend talked about marriage a bit, makes me so happy because I wanna spend my life with that perfect beautiful woman!
I bought my daughter a skateboard and hopped on one myself for the first time in 7 years (guess how old she is) and it was the most fun 2 hours I‚Äôve had in a very long time.
"Some guy on breddit had a neat bread recipe and pan, so I asked for the recipe.  He gave it to me.  I lamented having no yeast. He wished me luck.  Then I got a bunch of yeast by a stroke of weird luck.  

It is the only good internet thing to happen all week, and I don‚Äôt believe in luck. 

In other news, I deleted my Facebook app, thereby severing ties to everyone Important to me that I‚Äôve met in the last 30 years."
The sunrise coming over the mountain this morning. Felt good to space out from everything going on every day and have a moment to yourself
My dog who we brought home to keep comfortable till we could schedule his final vet visit is back up and running around. His hernia is now manageable and we can actually afford his surgery now.
My local African American owned restaurant had to shut down early because they ran out of food because of all the local patronage showing up in droves to support the business.
Today was the 40th day in a row I committed to yoga practice. I've never done any type of yoga before, and I'm amazing how much stronger I am. I'm getting more comfortable with stillness and being in the moment. And I'm not even close to being bored of it.
"There's a bird's nest outside my kitchen window and a robin has been nesting on it for a while. Today I got to see her feed her babies. It was so damn cool. 

I would protect those baby chickies with my life."
I dropped my son off at his new job, went back and grabbed the rest of the family and went to the park with my DIL and my three grandkids! We walked around, took pix, saw the biggest most beautiful park with waterfalls, ducks and geese and afterwards I bought us all frozen drinks! Also found out that this is a dog friendly park! We're taking them next time too!
"My spaz husky got out and I chased her a mile down the road like a mad man thinking she was going to get hit by a car. The car coming toward us pulled over, a mother and her daughter jumped out and helped me wrangle her by the collar. Then the daughter used her jacket as a makeshift leash, and they drove my dog and I back to my house.

I asked them how I could repay them for such kindness and they said someone paid for their food in line at Burger King and they're just paying it forward.

Faith in humanity restored for now."
My co-worker and friend of seven years told me he‚Äôs happy to see me and that he got the better end of the friendship deal. I  disagree, I definitely got the better end. üòä
I went to get a brain MRI done, and the lady that gave me the IV for the contrasting fluid beforehand, was super funny and sweet and made me feel very comfortable before an uncomfortable thing.
"After 2020 being a complete disaster in my personal life, I got my acceptance email to transfer to Embry-Riddle to study aerospace engineering. I started college in 2007 and quit in 2013 without finishing to join the military. I get out in December, and will finally go back to school in January. I'll only need 2.5 years to finish.

Everything bad that has happened to me this year is GONE. I'm so happy!"
Came home from a productive day at work, opened a beer, threw ball with my dog and watered my tomato plants.
One of my staff members spent at least 20 minutes telling me how much she appreciates me and enjoys working with me. That everyone we work with has become a family and has helped her through some very difficult times and have helped her grow. We both cried.
I finally uploaded a video to YouTube for the first time in five months. My mom and friends all called me to tell me what a good job I did. It made me so happy.
"A lady saw my empty tip jar and started my day off with a 5 dollar tip. She handed it to me but I put it in the tip jar and she said no I want YOU to have it. 

I told her don‚Äôt worry it will go to me. After she got her food she returned 15 minutes later and I was worried we had messed up her order. She had ordered the wrong item and tipped again on the next order and made me put the money in my pocket to assure it went to me. 

I was crazy busy the whole hour we had interacted and once her next order was busy she gave me another few dollars when I brought her out her food. 

It felt good to have someone acknowledge how busy I was and appreciate me being able to maintain a smile behind my mask while not making customers in the Togo window feel rushed. I appreciate you Diana, you made me smile."
Seeing my 8 week old smiling when she sees me. She‚Äôs my whole world, and for a little while, I‚Äôm hers too.
The student I work with made a really pretty art project out of natural materials. So that made me happy :)
"Not much this week at all. 

My pregnant spouse just got admitted to the hospital for the second time in two weeks (and I can‚Äôt see her due to COVID restrictions), my job‚Äôs stress level has sky rocketed and my brother got diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. It‚Äôs been rough."
My uncle is finally able to afford the treatment he needs for multiple skin cancers on his body. He begins his treatment today and I have never been happier seeing paramedics at my door this morning.
I saw a video of a homeless man who had all of his belongings burned during the protests receive brand new belongings like a new tent, air mattress, clothes, and food. He seemed incredibly happy and it really just made my day
Its my younger brothers birthday and we spent most the day in our inflatable pool in the garden that was filled with warm water and lots of bubble bath just chilling in the sun. (hes 14) we also had a water fight with water balloons and now we're sunburnt cuz we ignored our mom about suncream but it was worth it because we had fun.Quarantine has definitely made us spend more time together and broken his brain because no matter how many times i throw my pillows at him he continues to wake me up early when hes bored.But us trying to drown each other in a relatively flimsy inflatable pool filled with bubbles made me happy.
I hit plat rank in Apex Legends. It's not a particularly high rank per se, but I've never been really great at games so it feels like an accomplishment to me.
I went out to help my mom with her errands and I saw three individuals (at separate times) that I haven‚Äôt seen in years and one twice in one day.  I found it to be a funny occurrence....and I guess not seeing people for months does it too. It made me happy.
I finally finished the first book of script I've ever done. I feel proud of myself and accomplished after all those hours.
Got a new room, carpet wa spit down yesterday morning. Spent the afternoon and evening yesterday and all of today putting in a bed, couch, mini fridge, and stereo system and TV. It‚Äôs smaller than my old room but I don‚Äôt have to share it with my brother anymore so it‚Äôll be much more fun
I'm a little late on this one BUT I'M FREAKING PUMPED. My wife and I have been waiting to hear back on an appraisal for our house that we're selling, in order for the seller to be able to be financed from their lender. Well a few weeks have gone by which is unusual, but not completely unheard of. Well I just got a call from my realtor and the appraisal came back and now we can close on the sale. And we can finally build on our land that we've owned for a few years after a lot of anxiety and stress through the whole process. Well my friends, I can finally see the light.
Went kayaking on Lake Michigan; was totally by myself; felt like having the whole lake to myself :) Clear water and beautiful weather!
I had a very lengthy conversation with my sisters about race (we‚Äôre white). It was reassuring that we are all on the same page about fighting for PoC and putting action behind our words. We grew up conservative and haven‚Äôt always seen eye to eye on social issues and haven‚Äôt all always cared, but with us all becoming more liberal in recent years, we are all ready to take a stand. We are going to start educating ourselves and zoom calling every week to teach each other what we‚Äôve learned and continue to challenge each other‚Äôs thinking. It‚Äôs a small thing in the broader fight, but it made me happy to now my family has my back on social justice issues.
"Here in Small Town USA, we have a program to feed the kids of folks who have been thrown under the economic wheels since 2008...and now the post virus depression.

Today, we got a bunch of food donations and later a $1,000 donation.

Let the hate play out and tear gas roll in other places. In this place we're feeding our hungry kids."
I got a good paying job after being unemployed for 7 months. I'll get my first paycheck one week before my savings would have ran out
I shot -3 on the DiscGolf course. That‚Äôs average for me but it still feels good throwing the shots exactly how I have them drawn up.
Girlfriend of about 4 months told me she loved me for the first time! It‚Äôs both of our first serious relationship and we‚Äôre taking our time with it.
I work in a vet clinic and today a client left a very kind review on our website that said I was very helpful, informal, and kind with the euthanasia of their late Labrador. It always makes me happy to know I‚Äôm making the sorrow process easier to handle. May the goodest boy rest In peace.
I am a 14 y/o american but i live in the UK with my mother. My baby sister, my dad, and my step mom live in the US. I usually visit my dad for summer but since COVID is going on, i cant see my baby sisters 1st b-day. I got to talk to my sister on facetime today and everytime i do i love it and i make the most of it. Let this be a lesson to everyone, every second counts. :)
I work at a Humane Society. Today someone brought us a stray cat for intake into our adoption program. He was uber sweet, already neutered, and in great health. I scanned him and found he had a microchip. I contacted the company to receive his owners info. I did some research on his owners address in relation to his found location to make sure he wasn't dumped or abandoned. He was found only five miles from his home, and I found a lost kitty ad from a little over a year ago, posted by his owner on FB.  I excitedly called them up. They were so surprised. After over a year away from home they couldn't believe he was still alive, let alone found in good health. I set up an appointment and they picked him up to take him home this evening. It really warmed my heart.
"My daughter participated in a peaceful protest, as an ally, today. She says and does hard things, she‚Äôs full of conviction, and she has a sharp mind and giant heart. 

And I did that. Me and my husband, her stepfather."
I go back to work tomorrow. I‚Äôm a barber, and it‚Äôs not much and things aren‚Äôt perfect, but being deprived of my passion the past 3 months really had me depressed and stressed out and finally reaching out to my clients and getting back to doing what i love feels like a huge weight off my shoulders.
My avacado was perfect: no bruising, no browning, and just firm enough to cut into slices for my salad. It was a good day.
My dog hopped up on the couch and nudged his head under my chin, asking for cuddles and pets. He got ALL the cuddles and pets!
The grass in our backyard is a little overgrown. Sometimes there's a rabbit or two back there, but today there were five. I watched them for a little bit, and it was very heartwarming.
6hr late...foundout 20mins ago, which is 8mins until midnight. When I have checked my email that I got accepted into an university after not being in school in close to 7 years. :D
About 6 months ago I moved to the other side of the country from my family for my husband‚Äôs job. Today I got to talk to my little sister on the phone for quite a while and it made my day. She is graduating this weekend and I decided not to travel due to Covid and elderly family members. I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt be there so it was nice to talk.
Played tee-ball with my son  (3) on a real baseball field for the first time. He hit the ball off the tee but refused to run the bases, he just wanted me to tag him. Then we sat on the bench until it was his turn to bat again. No one else was there but us.
All my coworkers finally received their government issued covid-bonus. A lot of people were truly struggling and were beginning to worry about putting food on the table. This us a huge relief for a lot good people.
Showed a public defender that he was a punk ass, went to the neurologist and he says I'm brain cancer free, cut my grass, trimmed my bushes,  read my new book on my porch. I got to say today was a good day.
A customer told me to have a nice day and he said it in a way that I knew that he really meant it. It's made my day better.
"My sister is building a NEW house for her and her family, which means in 6-8 months I will be purchasing her old home for myself!! Me and a couple roommates will live there. It‚Äôs awesome! I love her home, and every time I looked at show homes I‚Äôd always compare them to her home. Soon it‚Äôll be mine

Although I‚Äôm extremely nervous as my job security took a major hit and the future is very unpredictable."
I bought a beautiful peice of fresh salmon and tons of fruit and vegetables to grill tomorrow with some wine. Stoked to sit on the porch with my SO and chill
I had the a temporary root canal  filling and had a hole that made me uncomfortable. today i had it permanently fixed
Connecting with my black nephew for the first time in almost a decade and lending support as the protests continue. I haven't been around because of my mom and things she did to me in the past. He told me how life was going and I'm proud of everything he's done since then.
i found out that i‚Äôm going to rehab sooner than we thought, like prolly tmrw or thursday. and i know that i need help and i‚Äôm finally ready to put in the effort to get better so i‚Äôm oddly excited to go.
"My coworker told me today that she wasn't surprised I got a near perfect score on my performance review.  It was my first one as management, and after 8 months of trying to get this leadership thing right, it was good to hear from someone that works directly with me that I'm not completely failing my duties.

Edit:  Also, my dog whined for ten solid minutes when I got home because she was so happy to see me."
New cat came nextdoor recently. They already have a another cat. I met the both of them today and petted them. Im in cat heaven.
I managed my 4th day of doing everything I needed at work. May not sound like a lot but my concentration has been gone and got more done today than 2 previous weeks combined.
A local business dropped yummy cupcakes to our station to say thank you on national first responders day.
"A spam caller called me and I responded in Spanish, they got frustrated and hung up on me!

P.S. I'm white"
I talked to a doctor about chronic fatigue and he confirmed I likely have sleep apnea. I'm potentially one step closer to a good night's sleep.
I completed a 19 hour drive and am laying in my own bed for the first time in two weeks :) it is a wonderful feeling!!
I was supposed to meet my girlfriend in Australia, be together while she studied. Well, corona happened so that got delayed indefinitely. Be celebrated today and she surprised me with a passport wallet. It's something super small and simple, but it made me so hopeful for the future.
A baby bird I found that had fallen from the nest three days ago survived and flew away today. I watched the mother bird feed it from a bush that I placed it in(I couldn't find the nest) for those three days. It made me feel good I helped give it a chance at survival.
I'm 32 and have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. I finally made a call to see a doctor about it. Its not till the 11th but I already feel better.
Today is my Birthday and rock climbing gyms open today as well! Spending time with family rn so ive had a great day today
The Indian dude (Rahul) in DC who opened his home to like 70 peaceful protesters last night so they didn‚Äôt get arrested and/or brutalized by the police. The man‚Äôs a damn hero.
After being rude to a member of my staff, a customer tripped on the stairs making herself look foolish.
My crush hugged me cause he was proud I'm helping myself with my starvation problem. Really made me proud of myself as well.
I‚Äôve had the best 24hours. Finally due to slight relaxations on my national lockdown my family was able to visit the garden of my wife‚Äôs mum and brother and sister. We sat out in the sun ate barbecue and enjoyed life again. Then today we went to my wife‚Äôs dads house where we saw them for the first time in weeks too. We swam, had some lunch and again spend time together again. Obviously all in the open air at a distance. Then once home we got on a video call to my parents who are still in protective isolation. We had a fun quiz and put the world to rights. I‚Äôve had a great day with my family and it‚Äôs extensions. We don‚Äôt usually manage all that on Xmas day. Every cloud and all that.
I was in line at the grocery store and I glanced up as an older man in a non-power wheelchair was trying to wheel himself and push a cart in front of him at the same time.. A woman with a child and things in her arms stopped and asked him if she could help him do his shopping.  This kind of stuff keeps my heart warm in a cold world.
Me and my girl friend went for a 10 mile hike in upstate NY today and a little bumble bee followed us and kept us company for about 7 of those miles
Phone call with my dad, listened to him talk about how excited to have gotten a new, much better job after working at the same shitty place for the last decade and a half. Very nice to hear him talk so positively about his career for a change
My mat leave is coming to an end. I'm lucky I'm in Canada so its been paid mat leave. My work is shut down until Nov and they're paying their main employees 70% to stay home. I've been waiting for confirmation that I will receive the same. Been nervous and worried. But today I got confirmation! And I get to stay home with my beautiful child! I'm very lucky and very thankful.
I helped a woman who had an infant go through self-check at Walmart. She had two carts totally full. Then I helped her take the carts to the parking lot and load the bags into her car. Then we exchanged names and chatted a minute about the crisis at hand. It was just a nice human interaction especially during these tumultuous times. I‚Äôm white and she‚Äôs black, but I didn‚Äôt help her for that reason. I helped her because she is a mom with an infant and I remember those days trying to juggle everything. It took about 30 minutes from beginning to end. I would do it again! The act of kindness made me happy.
I got a good paying job today. I'm really hopeful this can help me save up to pursue my dream career.
"My uni teacher just said that my thesis was really well written and said I should publish it! I'm really insecure about everything in my life, so that was a really nice boost in this difficult times...
Sorry if I wrote anything wrong, English is not my first language"
I got into my top choice program at my university! it‚Äôs a competitive program most years but this year the cutoff was unusually high. I barely got in (my average WAS the cutoff) but I still did and that‚Äôs what matters! super relieving :)
"Not necessarily happy, but hopeful. This sounds incredibly pathetic, but here goes:

My overall life situation sucks right now (fired in March, single dad, living with parents) and I've been craving companionship. But speaking with my aforementioned roommates, they're looking into temporarily helping me adopt a dog in their house."
I GOT HIRED!!! After being laid off for 3 months I got a web dev job! (I‚Äôm still in college so I was as financially strained as other but it definitely feels good to know I will being having some cash flow again)
I've been the only one stocking wood by hand at my lumberyard for months. A vendor held a golden ticket event of sorts where they hide prizes in between stacks of wood. I was the first to redeem one!
I was told I have a very very high chance of getting a job with decent pay. This‚Äôll be my first proper job if I do get it!
My partner and I took our 10 year old dog to the dog park today. He had ACL surgery a few months ago. Today was his first day back after months of slowly building up his strength.
I rode a bicycle for the first time in almost 10 years!  I have multiple sclerosis with balance issues among other things so this really was a big deal for me.
I called my gf who live 8 hours away and ranted about my stress and she just listened and supported me. And then we talked about a new outfit she bought that makes her feel pretty and I‚Äôm really excited to see her soon!!
Today, I paid off the last of my court fines, and celebrated 18 months clean and sober! Feels FANTASTIC to have my life back.
"I was at the protests in NYC today. When a couple of friends and I were leaving and about a block away from the march, a man on a bike slowed down and told us to ‚Äústay safe tonight‚Äù.

I appreciate that not only as a gesture of solidarity, but also as a subversion of what you expect when a man stops a group of women on the street. Instead of being catcalled, we were given kindness. I think that‚Äôs awesome.

#blacklivesmatter"
I was given a bid for $10,000 to repair my busted sewer line from a reputable company after initially receiving bids in excess of $25K from other companies. Covid completely drying up my business for months and my first child being due in less than 3 months has been stressful enough. Adding the equivalent to buying a new car on top of all this had only made matters worse. This was a tremendous weight lightened(definitely not off) from my shoulders.
Me and my daughter were on the balcony watching the protest.. she screamed ‚ÄúHELLO!!!‚Äù and people waved back. She had a massive smile on her face. It was beautiful.
This is so simple but...The new brand of almond milk we bought tasted so good mixed with coffee. I just tried it for the first time today
My senior (19 y.o.) cat had a series of seizures yesterday and I woke up to her alive and well this morning. Every day I get with her is a blessing that I'll forever be grateful for.
Woke up still pregnant at 22 weeks with a healthy baby (I had a previous loss due to premature birth at 20 weeks back in November)
"I have been on a disciplinary action for the last year at my work due to not meeting my expectation, which has put me on probation and essentially made me prone to being fired. For the last year I have been constantly stressed and worried about my job and has leaked into feeling dissatisfied in other aspects of my life. Over the course of the past several months I have exceeded my expectations. Today the paperwork to lift my probation was completed! 

AND I‚Äôve been doing so well that my boss asked me to start mentoring people who have been struggling lately (which is almost everyone in the midst of this pandemic). 

It‚Äôs so nice to breathe fresh air again and to be successful at a job I always knew I could excel in :)"
I haven‚Äôt listened to music in a couple months. I just started revisiting music I listened to when I was growing up.
I made it home from work. Always makes me happy since I‚Äôm extra afraid of dying in a car crash specifically on the way home from work. I don‚Äôt wanna die after I work all day so I love making it home safely.
I went to my first cross fit gym session and sucked. I can't wait to kick my own ass and show the love of my life and myself that I can be a true fighter!
I didn‚Äôt have a panic attack or horrible anxiety and felt the dark clouds in my head part for the first time in months. So today was the thing that happened that made me happy. üòä
I was given an award today at work for preventing a lady from walking out with over $500 worth of merchandise. I‚Äôve been having a rough week and the award cheered me up immensely.
I cleaned the absolute living *shit* out of my house today, for the first time in months, and made significant progress on my novel! It was completely impulsive, and now I want to put a system in place that keeps this going!
I jumped with my kid on his trampoline. Then we lie on the trampoline and watched the stars. It‚Äôs so much fun explaining space to a 4 year old. He is all about space and was telling me how he wants to be just like buzz lightyear and go to the moon with me someday ‚ù§Ô∏è. So wholesome.
I got to work alongside my favorite co-worker, who happens to be my best friend, and when our shifts ended at the same time I took her home and we had a nice conversation on the way.
"I finally filed for student allowance. I was supposed to do it for like, a month already. But things are hard and my motivation‚Äôs in the shitter.

But I finally did it."
I used to listen to this one hour long track that always made me happy, but I lost it 15+ years ago and no amount of online searching could find it. My friend just emailed it to me and said it was on his old hard drive from way back when he originally showed it to me. I'm dancing!!!
I got my first dirt bike and I finally got to ride it today and my dad and brother helped me get comfortable and I crashed into a fence and flew 8 feet up into the air and 6 feet away from my bike and my brother took me out to get some drinks
"YES!

I caught a tilapia!
It makes me happy-a!
.
.
.
(I wonder what my encyclopedia says about my new catch.)"
I found out that my hiking backpack was all moldy from storage. But I also found out that my tent and everything else inside of it was untouched :)
A coworker was posting some racist shit in a group text that everyone was joining in on. I finally stood up for myself and told them all I don't stand for that shit. Today my boss told him he isn't welcome to work with us anymore and told everyone else he doesn't tolerate violence or hate speech. I work in a pretty conservative, blue collar industry so was happy to see my boss shut that kind of talk down. I hope those guys take a moment of self reflection tonight.
My girlfriend said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù to me. She says it multiple times every day but it gets better every time she says it to me üòä
"One of my friends told me how much I mean to them today. They told me that when they showed their coming out post to some friends, they didn‚Äôt bat an eye and didn‚Äôt seem to care. They said that when they showed it to me, I had the nicest reaction of anyone and it really made me happy. ‚Äú I was kinda sad because I had been super proud of myself. And then! You came in all like ‚Äúomg that‚Äôs so great good for you!‚Äù And it made me super happy‚Äù 
Also, if you‚Äôre seeing this please don‚Äôt look through my Reddit I know you have reddit."
This started yesterday and continued today. My hubby of 37 yrs offered to put on some music while I was reading and playing solitaire. I asked for some 'Britpop', which he answered by putting on a mix of Oasis, Blur, Arctic Monkeys and a few others. Somehow it came up that I thought Noel Gallagher did all the writing and Liam did all the singing. Hubby loved to educate and test me on this, so after a couple examples, he started a game of Liam or Noel. I'm a natural and I even figured out when he threw in a Blur to confuse me.
i picked up a milkshake and got to deliver it to my boyfriend whom i haven't seen in a couple months :)
"I visited my grandparents with my 2 year old daughter today. My grandfather has alzhemiers and dementia and somedays he really struggles to remember people especially my daughter.

Because of the COVID situation our visit was through a window, we were outside and they were inside their house. It brought tears to my eyes to hear him say ""Thats pops girl""."
I had some good laughs today with my mates even when I wasn‚Äôt feeling it.  Feels good to know that I was part of that.
"I was very patient and kind to a curious squirrel. After about ten minutes of saying very nice things to him, he climbed out of my tree and groomed himself beside me on my stoop.

Archibald and I are now best friends. He likes the tomato basil lentil snaps, and prefers when I speak to him in French."
I was furloughed and then put into a placeholder position for a month working overnight shifts. I was told last week I got my old job back and today was my first day back. The amount of ‚Äúwe missed you‚Äù and the level of enthusiasm for me being in my original role really had me feeling a lot happier than I‚Äôve been in a while.
"One of the best SEO influencers brought me onto his team, I got several new clients, and I mentored a few people who left me fantastic reviews and helped launched my buddies course.

And I hit Diamond 2 in Starcraft. :)"
Due to covid I've lost my job and unlikely to find another for a while - my experience is in organising large gatherings of people. To help me get through it, i planted a whole bunch of vegetables in the garden to cut costs and today made my first meal using things Ive grown! It feels so good!
I finished my art that has been on hold for a week. I may not be good but I was really satisfied finishing it.
One of my best friends told me that she‚Äòs pregnant. This made me so happy that I am posting my first comment after years of lurking. I‚Äôm just soooo happy for her and her fianc√©!
My mom got me some loose leaf tea for my birthday. I enjoyed a cup of earl grey tea. It‚Äôs not much but that little bit of peace and warmth was nice.
My English teacher was proud of me for getting a price that I wrote out into the world. You can check it out if you want https://www.wattpad.com/user/Fireball78
"My FWB giving me a hug and telling me he appreciates me.

We aren‚Äôt in a relationship, we are just really tight and bang occasionally. He‚Äôs a little rough around the edges but he‚Äôs an amazing guy anyone would be lucky to be around. 

It‚Äôs nice to feel appreciated and have that level of comfort and lack of judgement"
My best online friend in a game asked me to play with him exclusively. Just yesterday I felt kinda neglected and was tired of playing in a big group, since we were playing together only for months. I missed the talks, the laughter. Everything. And then this message appeared. As if he could read my mind.
When I was tidying up, I found a long lost dog toy behind the couch. My dogs were thrilled and I was happy to witness their joy.
Today is the funeral of my friend who sadly ended his own life at 17 years old. This morning, the hearse came to pick him up and the entire street was covered in people to see him off (we are in NZ where social gatherings have reopened). There were so many people and while it was so sad, it was such a glorious act of humanity. Please know that if you‚Äôre feeling similar to how my friend did, there are so many people who care.
Being alone in my area of the store for like 3 hours so I could take my mask off for a little bit and whistle to my music. Y'all know how hard it is to whistle with a mask on?
My extremely small hometown police department posted a simple pride flag photo on Facebook. I know it's not much. I know it probably could be a diversion tactic. But, I'll take something completely out of the ordinary for this evening and be happy for a step forward on that.
"My daughter told me that ""I'm the funniest daddy ever"" and also that ""I can fix anything!"" I'm not that handy or funny but I'm glad she thinks so."
My ex and I are slowly getting back together. Today I took off work and we laid in bed and watched YouTube videos all day and had Sonic delivered for lunch.
I meditated with a group of people around the world and we listened to each other about life and just supported each other without judgment.
"My grandma knew I‚Äôd lost my favourite clear nail polish so she went out of her way to find it for me. She got me 2 bottles because I only gave her the brand name (my mistake) and she didn‚Äôt know which one I preferred so she got both :)

Also made a cookie recipe I haven‚Äôt looked at in ages and they turned out amazing!"
I finally opened up to my mom about how depressed I‚Äôve felt. I have lifted a heavy weight off my chest.
I reminded myself that even though you might not speak to me again, I have lots of fun little memories. Thanks for reminding me that maybe someone out there could care for me, even if that isn‚Äôt you.
I avoided social media all day, got home, played a little bass with a small amp made out of an Altoids can, thought it was funny so I uploaded a short video of it to IG. . . Then I started seeing posts of black squares on everyone‚Äôs feed..
I was working at an apartment complex today installing light fixtures for their swimming pool, and this small Chaldean woman who lived there came up to me and asked if I needed anything to drink. It was a small act of kindness but she totally went out of her way to offer it to me and my colleague. So sweet.
Went to the skate park over lunch and had a nice shred session. I'm almost 40 and grateful for every afternoon that I still get to enjoy my hobby
Went to Tim Hortons for a coffee. Girls working at till were sweet and were making jokes. I laughed along. When I got my coffee, there was a smily face on it. Made my day.
I bought a colourful lamp awhile ago that I adore and the bulb exploded because I left it on too long, I couldn‚Äôt find a replacement anywhere but today I managed to find one :))
"One of my little girls happened to burst into our bedroom this morning while the wife and I were getting caught up on the night's happenings on the news. 

There happened to be a woman in tears speaking on screen. My daughter watched for a second, then turned and asked ""why she crying?"" 

Wife and I didn't know what to say so I just responded with ""shes very sad"".

Her response: ""oh...maybe I give her hug, make her feel better?""

Made us both very happy.."
My 4 month old bunny insisted on helping me clean her poop box. She climbed on my lap and tried to bite the little scooper and she pulled bits of hay from the box. She is so tiny and soft I love her.
"My little brother (still lives at home) went with me and helped me find a load of landscaping gear to help my parents, who both suffer from depression, finally clean up their yard. I just got a call from my dad who was almost in tears thanking me and he talked about how things were looking up despite the virus

TLDR; my depressed dad called me and talked when he doesn‚Äôt very often"
My partner encouraging me to apply to more law schools rather than settling for a law school in my area that doesn't have a program I'm genuinely interested in. I've been struggling with figuring out my selth worth and I have been having negative self talk where I think that I cant be accepted anywhere else. She told me that I can and will be accept many places. So that made me feel pretty good and motivated.
My 2yr old was walking around the house in my shoes.  I also heard my wife get peed on by my newborn. Laughed for awhile.
"I got to attend a wedding for one of my oldest and best friends and his wife who has over the years become a great friend on her own accord. It was a private ceremony held in my friend's parent's backyard, officiated by the bride's father (one of the chillest and funniest ministers I've ever met), and I had the luck of attending with me and my brother being the only non-family guests at the ceremony (a number of other people virtually attended through a zoom call). It was originally going to be a ""normal"" wedding with lots of guests but due to the pandemic it had to be a small private affair and I felt very lucky that I got to attend."
"My mother thanked me several times for taking care of her. She has dementia and she doesn‚Äôt always say things like this. She never was a feels/mushy type personality. Makes it feel
Somewhat better."
Got the news that my newborn got the all clear to come home tomorrow after two and a half weeks in NICU.
My job is going to let me work from home indefinitely since I bought a house 2 hours away from the office. I didn‚Äôt expect it at all and was looking for new jobs.
"Today marked 11lbs down.... I've been intermittent fasting and doing a 1200 calorie diet. 

I haven't done anything like this before, and I've been overweight for 9 years now. It makes me feel good that even though I hate everything about this diet, I'm making progress. I know I'm dropping the weight fast because I'm overweight, but it's still encouraging to me :)"
I got to talk with a friend that I haven't talked with in a while and saw it was your cake day. Happy cake day!
Worked out a way to not have to transfer locations for my job. I‚Äôve never been this happy at a job and the idea of having to leave was not something I wanted to deal with.
Gyms are open and I can finally start losing the weight I packed on over the quarantine.  Got my first workout of freedom in today.
Filed a wage complaint against my former employer earlier this year; after I left, I was told I wasn't owed any additional money when my pay schedule and simple fucking math showed that was a lie. I didn't expect anything to come of it, so was pleasantly surprised to the tune of a couple hundred unexpected dollars today.
My son graduated from high school today, via zoom. It should have been in person but with the way things are currently with the virus this is the way it had to be.
I was in a zoom meeting for work and someone randomly suggested we all take shots, so we did. It was so funny, I miss my coworkers!
Me and my friend helped a random guy buy pads for his gf. Made me happy knowing there are guys over there that are not ashamed that we women indeed do bleed lol
I just did my valedictorian speech today. This is more of a lifetime goal than a happy occasion. I was a pretty bad student when I was in elementary school. I was disobedient, had bad grades, and was just overall a shitty kid. My parents were always disappointed in me and always knew that I had potential. I decided in 5th grade that I wanted to become better with school and wanted to be successful in life, so, 8 years of hard work and having 4.0 my entire middle and high school years payed off. What also made me happy was that, a month or so ago, I got accepted into MIT and will head there in August to where I can soon become a technological engineer at spacex. I have some pretty big goals in life, but I will work and achieve those goals.
Jumped outside on the trampoline with my little sister in the bright and beautiful sunlight, with green leaves all around.
I pushed myself and went for a run. I‚Äôve been pretty depressed with everything that‚Äôs happening in US. I feel better. üëç
I‚Äôve had heart pain and panic attacks every day of every minute for about a month, today was the first time I actually feel like I got a break.
I saw a protest happening on campus near where I live and it gave me some hope. I hope all the protestors out there are okay though...
I had a great wholesome conversation with a person I met on Minecraft and we had a great conversation about religion and depression it made my frickin day.
"This is gonna get buried but I‚Äôve been casually throwing unsalted peanuts in my backyard and today the squirrel and the crow that frequent my backyard (absolutely no reason for that) teamed up today and walked over to my glass sliding door! 

Now that makes me happy but more than that my dumb cat finally was awake and down stairs to SEE IT instead of sleeping upstairs like he normally is. 

So to make a long story short, he is now glued to the window and keeps coming over and meowing at me like ‚ÄúOMG DID YOU SEE WHAT WAS OUTSIDE!?! IT WAS CRAZY!‚Äù And then running back over to the window.

I love that little nitwit..."
At the park with family holding my infant, kids were playing baseball and hit a pop up foul ball, they yelled heads up so I covered my baby‚Äôs head instead of mine. My cousin saw that and said aww what a good dad. It made me feel good
"My boyfriend got into his respiratory therapy program at school after trying for the 4th year in a row. 

It‚Äôs lottery based which sucks since he has really good grades. It definitely made me happy cry for him! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Its my birthday and my friends came over and spent time with me.

 Dont worry, in Germany it is allowed to have visitors again."
"My husband had work for the first time in months. We have our own small construction company and I work as a lunch lady. Meant the world today that we might have some discretionary income. 
Plus my flowers I planted in the fall are blooming!"
"A long line of protesters walkeing past my office building peacefully. I work on the top floor and heard them. Looked through the window and there they were, there were busses stopped that were honking their horns and by the time I got downstairs there was still a hefty crowd going down the road. No one getting hurt or anything. 

I work about 8 blocks away the white house so they'd been walking for a good while."
I saw more posts of people differentiating peaceful protesters from the looters and borderline criminals
"I got a record I've wanted for a long time.  Bill Evans - You Must Believe In Spring.  Washed over me and brought me to tears.  Nothing like wanting something so bad and it turning out exactly as you hoped.

Everything else today was absolutely garbage."
I have a favorite dog at the daycare.  She‚Äôs a beautiful red golden retriever.  She was the last one to get picked up today, so after I finished shutting everything down, we did a photo shoot together.  She loves to model!
My wife and I's garden is doing fantastic and we bought an above ground pool so we can enjoy the summer regardless of unemployment and the protests happening. We planted 2 different types of peas a week ago and they are already getting to the point where they are climbing the trellis and our romaine lettuce is ready for salads. It's really uplifting seeing your hard work payoff.
"**An older lady out on a walk by herself today told me that my yard and garden was coming along nicely this year.** 

I have been landscaping and gardening my way out of a dark hole during these past few months, for hours a day, getting dirty, muddy, cut up, bruised, chased by bees, wasps and hornets, crawled on by ants and other weird fuzzy things, and it feels like no one really notices. So it was nice that someone had noticed it and was brave enough to speak to me while I was working on it all.  Thanks, Lady!"
Somebody [flew a plane over my city and drew a smiley face in the sky.](https://www.reddit.com/r/itookapicture/comments/gvgt2z/itap_of_a_smiley_face_in_the_sky/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
I helped figure out a major incident at work, even though I knew very little about the system I was working with. Made me feel like I actually know wtf I'm doing lol
"I got to see my apartment for the first time.
I'm finally moving out of my abusive parents house into a place more my own"
I talked to my boss today about how I feel like I need to find a job that‚Äôs better for my personal situation, and he was 100% supportive of my decision and is proud that I‚Äôm trying to better myself and keep growing, even if it means leaving the company.
I found out that I won't be needing radiation treatment.  If all is well in three months time, I'll be on my way to remission.
I got to work on the toy chest I'm making for my baby girl. She will be 1yr old in two weeks time. I get vast amounts of satisfaction from this work. Thank you for asking this question today. I needed a boost.
"This will get buried but:

I quit my job. I was managing a jewelry store filled with toxic people, and my upper management did nothing to support me. I was constantly being stepped on for trying to help people and always getting taken advantage of. Currently taking the steps forward to join the Navy, and I couldn‚Äôt be more relieved. 

The only issue is now, I‚Äôm in a really bad spot financially and will have to break my lease on my apt and live out of my car for a couple weeks. But that still doesn‚Äôt beat the mental torture my employees put me through and now I‚Äôm in control of my life again and that beats being anywhere I‚Äôm not happy any day out of the week."
My friend moved back to our city and I got to see her for the first time in months! My cat was very excited to see her
I met a customer who had the same name as me, drove a Volkswagen, that is the same color as mine and is even diesel made me super happy for some reason.
I finally left the house, walked a while and listened to music and suddenly, the music sounded 1000√ó better
Seeing the power of the people behind #blacklivesmatter. Shame #alllivesmatter isn't getting the same attention
I graduated high school today! It was kind of weird because i walked across an empty room on camera, but it was still so exciting! I can‚Äôt wait to go to college and experience the world!
Spent online playing with my friends from a different country. I am 20 now but it's been my dream since 2014 to have a squad to play with and laugh with.
I started a Fiverr (online service) business for VFX editing (as a way to be productive during quarantine.) After a month of no orders, I finally got my first customer and he gave me a 50% tip!
"I'm a day closer to my first grad school class. And it's what is getting me through life at the moment. 

A bad undergrad GPA and I'd never thought I'd get where I am. I'm grateful for the chance and I'm going to try not to blow it."
I've been working on losing weight since the start of the year. I have a habit of roller coastering when it comes to weight loss. Do well for a few months, lose 20lbs but then gain it, and some more, all back. I weighed myself this morning and discovered I'm down 30lbs since January. My goal is 70lbs and I'm so excited I'm almost 50% of the way there. I can't go to my family because they belittle my accomplishments. So I'm sharing it here.
My SO wasn‚Äôt feeling well, and I slowly helped her feel better throughout the day by doing little things. Also, sharing dumb jokes with my coworkers. Great post, by the way. Making people recognize some good things.
I made a ton of progress on a 1000-piece puzzle that is pretty much just sand. I hate it, but I love that I‚Äôm almost done.
Second day in a row that the sassy kitty of the two has laid next to the chill kitty. This is two years in the making ü•∞
I passed a math placement test which allowed me to pick my classes for the fall! Huge monkey off my back!
I was walking out of Costco and a little girl waved at me! I think maybe it was because I might have looked like a princess with my blue eyeshadow on lol.
I got to talk to my brother today.  I've been worried about him and I cried and made me laugh and made me feel safe.  He's my younger brother and I love him so much.
After the hotel I work at was shut down for 2 months due to corona I was at work again. I really didn't think that I would enjoy it that much
"I looked at my partner on camera after he was remotely helping me with a computer issue and realised how much I love them and how lucky I am to have found them.

The feelings of just knowing they are the one is something I haven't felt before - it is still quite early on in the relationship but I am honestly so sure that I'd be happy to spend my life with the sweetest human I've ever met. I really hit the jackpot with them and it makes me super happy after so many times of getting it wrong."
I officially graduated today. I am the first person from my family who went to University and then went for Master's. It was a virtual convocation and even though my parents don't understand english, they sat through the whole cermemony to just see me getting a degree. This was the best day as i could make them proud.
My community recycling center opened back up so I was able to clean out the stuff from my garage that's been accumulating for the past 2.5 months.
"My dog and cat are currently snuggled on my lap. This has never happened before. Normally my dog has too much energy and my cat is not about it. Somehow, the stars aligned and they decided my lap was where they both wanted to chill.

"I finally got *Fallout 3* to finally work.

I enjoyed the first 2 Fallout games when they were new. For various reasons never got into any of the sequels, and after a while was too depressed to play games of any kind.

Last month I installed and played *Fallout: New Vegas^ and played it through. Terrific game. Crashed a lot but there was a month‚Äôs worth of stuff to do with side quests and DLCs.

So now I‚Äôve gone back to the game before it, and I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôve got another month to explore the wastes."
I talked to my mom and one of my sisters. It‚Äôs a hard day. I attended a peaceful protest yesterday. There are more I will be attending this week. I am grieving for POC. After I spoke with my family, I decided to cook some comfort food. It helped me festers a bit.
I walked my dog with my friend and her dogs  her dogs were really excited to see me. My dog was really excited to see her too. She‚Äôs a good friend.
A simple thing, but my daughter was with her dad for the afternoon. The first thing she did when she came through the door was bring me a can of Coke Zero she bought me from the shop whilst they were together. She‚Äôs 5 and so adorable, this really did make me smile.
My dad came home from working on another island for nearly a month. My mom died 6 months ago and they had been married almost 45 years. We've been leaning on each other a lot and it's really good to have him home, even if he has to leave again soon. It's hard for him because he's so isolated there, and he's a really outgoing person who thrives on interaction. So yeah, really happy to have him home for the next few days!!
I saw a video of a girl putting on a wig. Made me really glad I donated my hair knowing that a kid out there is smiling because of it.
"Mine is kind of stupid and selfish, but I got a new TV that I can actually hear.

We've been using the same TV for 12 years and no matter what receiver or speaker combination we used, I could not hear dialogue very well and it always sounded muffled. I have pretty bad hearing and it drove me crazy. We finally bit the bullet and got a new TV and it makes a HUGE difference. I can enjoy watching stuff again and not ask about the plot every 5 minutes because I missed something."
For one this thread. It's nice to see positive stuff when reddit if full of stuff from the protests in the US but another thread about seeing people in cars and realising that they are actual people with full lives because it reminds me how everyone on the Internet is the same and I love and cherish that thought every time it pops in
My 6yo daughter found out she is really good at frisbee. We played catch for about an hour and was catching just about everything and has a great throw. I‚Äôve decided to train her as an elite disc golfer.
I just got off the phone with a hopeful mentor and think I've decided what area of my field I want to specialize in. I'm excited that I've found an area that might be a really good fit.
My dad made pretty good shrimp tacos, I also got a really good sandwich for lunch that I just realized I still have some left over! Yum Thanks for reminding me
My girlfriend got selected for a new job she really likes. She is so excited and that makes me very happy.
I was about to say thanks for making me realize that I haven't been happy about a single thing today but then a kid flipped a pool float trying to jump on it and I got a good laugh so I guess that counts.
I got my USB to DC adapter so i can use my portable charger to power my synth so i can make music on the go!
I figured out a way to prop my phone up against my glass shower door so I can watch porn while taking a shower.
Honestly what's made me happy today is OP's responses to the comments. So thoughtful and just fucking lovely.
A toddler came up and hugged my dog while we were on a walk at the park. Only sad that I didn‚Äôt get the picture
Not today, but yesterday I got accepted into nursing school. I am so proud of myself and ready to start my path to become a nurse.
An old colleague reached out to me with a possible job.   I‚Äôve been looking to change for a while now.
"I ran my first ever half-marathon (21.1k / 13.1mi)!!
I did only in lieu of the official one I was supposed to run on the weekend but it was cancelled. 

I‚Äôm so proud of myself! I only started running last year and couldn‚Äôt even run a 5k this time last year. 

Go me!!"
"I'm nearly 60 but while I was waiting at the atm today the even older guy using it (maybe 80, white hair, one of those  walker things) asked me for help...all he wanted to do was withdraw $20 but he'd somehow gotten confused and it was asking him to deposit cheques....so I showed him how to press cancel and then how to  get $20....and he was happy.

And I was happy too....I'm unemployed and old, it feels nice to be useful and helpful...."
I came home and my boyfriend was sitting in the living room in nothing but underwear watching star wars and he handed me a margarita.
My puppy associated the front door with needing to go outside to ‚Äúpotty‚Äù. We‚Äôve only had her for a little over two weeks, so it was a great accomplishment in my eyes
I went to a chiropractor and left with a couple adjustments and a much more positive outlook on life. My back pain has been getting so bad lately.
"I cried. I was watching the second to last episode of Travellers on Netflix. Spoiler alert: David dies. And I just started crying. It was such a beautiful scene, but still so sad. He was my favorite character. Like Marcy put it: ""he was the kind of person that made humanity worth saving"". I saw myself in him, and I think we would be friends. I don't cry very often, once every few months. I believe last time was in December. But when I do, it all comes out. Months and months of feelings in one, good cry session. And I feel relieved. So yeah, even though I feel like shit right now, I also feel relieved. Oh, and maybe worth mentioning, I finished reading Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets for the 26th time today.

P.s. you should all go watch Travellers on Netflix, such an amazing show!"
Assembled a new telescope for my daughter.  She‚Äôs 9 and had plenty of questions while watching the SpaceX launch the other day.  Figured I‚Äôd double down on the space thing.  I‚Äôm happy to be her Dad.
I work in retail and a customer was very friendly to me. With how divided the U.S is today, with how violent the protests have been, and with the pandemic going on, it was nice to feel that friendliness coming from them.
Adopted another fur baby üíñ this will be the second cat we have adopted, and we also have a rescue pup of 4 years now üò¢
I took the day off. Ever since this whole pandemic started, I haven‚Äôt really been able to. Finally, after much contemplation, I called in. Best day to relax with my boyfriend (since it‚Äôs his day off too), and laugh, and just have some time to breathe. May not get a lot of attention for this post, but I want to say that I‚Äôm truly happy in this moment. And I hope all of you get your happy moment today as well :)
"My new skin care routine is working. My skin is starting to clear up and look more hydrated. I am positive that if I keep doing this, I will get back the glow that I used to have.  

Also, remembering that it has been a year since my ex bf broke up with me thru text and not crying over it/him anymore."
I usually dont comment on any post, but my first son was born yesterday and I've never been this happy in my life. :D
I got just the biggest damned giggles and laughs out of my 4 month old daughter.  Not the first time I've pulled that off, but it does just about make my day every time I do it.  Also, I finally pulled the trigger on buying some good quality watches that I've been eyeing up, and when I went to buy, it turns out that one of them was eligible for a buy one get one free sale, so I actually got 3 watches instead of just two!  Today was a good day.
"I was looking at the sub r/fairytaleasfuck and showed my husband something that could work for his d&d campaign he is dming. He kissed me on top of the head and told me I am fairytale as fuck, very affectionately. 

It‚Äôs the little things."
My daughter snuggled in to me while we were on the couch. It lasted 3 seconds and decided that the dog looked more snuggly.
I got home from work and the moment my ten month old saw me his face lit up and he immediately crawled over to me.
I recently cut my hair super short and today my 4 year old goddaughter has been telling her parents she wants her hair cut like mine. :)
My daughter running to me like she hadn‚Äôt seen me in days after I was only gone for possibly two hours.

While having coffee and looking at my phone there were no corona virus updates and no protest news for like 15 minutes i enjoyed the 15 minutes to meditate and think about things im grateful for.
I love my coworkers and today I started my day off with a home-baked lemon cookie and some company compensated coffee. Every day is what you make it :)
My mum is soooo stressed right now and I ran her a bath with candles and music and let her borrow my body cream - she looked so happy and relaxed afterwards it made me smile from ear to ear
I gave some resources to a struggling new player in No Man‚Äôs Sky. I played some games with a friend I hadn‚Äôt spoken to for a while.
Received videos of my dog sunbathing in the backyard. Think about her all day, booked a flight few days ago to go back home. Miss her a lot so my mom makes sure to send me any videos and pictures she can!
I participated in a protest and demonstration in downtown Pittsburgh, and while it was tense, it remained calm and free of violence until its conclusion. Both sides conducted themselves in a respectable manner. It was a little glimmer of triumph and hope.
My wife went in for an ultrasound for our first child (due Dec. 9th) and everything is moving along perfectly. I‚Äôm so pumped to be a dad.
"I watched 'The Fly 1986' movie.

It was frickin' gruesome, but my family and I liked it for some reason."
My bike got a flat so i had to wait in a parking lot for a friend of mine to come pick me up. Then a jeep rolled up to me and it was two girls and the driver goes ‚Äúmy friend thinks your cute‚Äù so i run over to the car and get some phone numbers. I felt pretty alpha I‚Äôm not gonna lie.
I saw like a 7 - 11 yr old Kenyan boy receive a presidential award for inventing a wooden machine to clean your hands.
A close friend of mine told me she ‚Äútalked/thought about me at least once a day‚Äù and I almost cried tears of joy

I started a job yesterday and had my second day today. Everyone there is just so incredibly nice and so willing to help with anything I‚Äôm confused about. It‚Äôs a popular retail store across the US and i was never expecting it to be as amazing as it is. I‚Äôm already making friends and finding myself so happy because of it
I read through many of the responses to this question, and there was true happiness. God I needed that.
I just cooked up the nicest dinner.  And now I‚Äôm enjoying a glass of wine listening to music that I love.  I‚Äôm allowing myself 15 minutes to read the news of the day, and then the iPad gets shut off and I‚Äôll relax before bed.  It was kind of a shitty day, but all that melts away when I‚Äôm faced with my real life.
saw my best friend misspell ‚Äògrind‚Äô. they said ‚Äògrint.‚Äô they always get so mad abt it and its so funny so it gave me the biggest grin. the notification for it went off seconds before the one for this, so. why not.
i caught up with a close friend through video call. also spoke to my college advisor about my enrolled classes!!
On Mother‚Äôs Day we adopted a 3 month husky puppy. Today the shelter called us saying that one of her litter mates was returned, and we‚Äôre going to go get her tomorrow ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
I got in a motorcycle accident this morning... but my cute neighbor came by my place and made me food, did some dishes and rolled me a joint. Also, she wasnt wearing a bra and had a very thin white shirt on. It was worth the crash...
My sister who is 17 lead peaceful protest in our town of people of similar age. She didn‚Äôt organize it but she helped put it all together. People yelled at her and she held her ground. Couldn‚Äôt be happier
"I stood up to a co-worker that was bullying another co-worker and he toed the line and went back to work.  The bullied co-worker came to me later and told me the other guy apologized.

Felt pretty damn good to finally well up some gumption and hold some jackass's integrity up to them.  In my defense for butting in, he gets bullied a lot and it's really starting to show, and I really feel sorry for the guy.

Edit:. I also went up to the guy and smoothed things out afterward.  We found common ground and everything worked out."
"I live in South Minneapolis and there is a lot of stuff going on in my area rn and so it can be hard to keep a smile on my face.  However, today at work (I work at a daycare), I had two things happen that stood out.

\#1 I have a 4 yr old boy in my class that had asked me if he could paint at lunch time.  I told him he could paint, but would have to do it after lunch and nap.  He begrudgingly waited, but kept asking me if it was time to paint yet.  Well the moment nap is over, he wakes up, struts up to me, looks me dead in the eye and says, ""Uh, duuuuuude.  It's after nap now.""  Needless to say, I had a laugh and kid got to paint.

\#2 A little girl told me how much fun she had playing outside with me.  Nothing too out of the ordinary, but it's the simple things."
I fell asleep watching a show with my boyfriend and woke up to him just looking and me with the cutest look on his face. I love him.
"Today was 8th grade promotion here. Very happy and proud of my child being at the top of the class and getting ready to move on to high school.

It was a very strange event and different from my own experiences, but this is what they know and are pushing forward to the next chapter."
My baby has started dancing. There‚Äôs something about that little booty shake a baby does when they‚Äôve just learned to stand up that‚Äôs so adorable!
Had some chicken soup made with love from my mama. This is a rare occasion now but she used to make me chicken soup like every week as it is cheers me up
"I'm a city boy, grew up loving horses and taking riding lessons. I moved across the country to a rural town in Montana. Horses everywhere. Yesterday, I met one of the neighbors who is training a young quarter horse, and she said I'm welcome to come down to visit this colt any time.

Today, while out for my evening walk, I stopped by to visit with the colt, and I put an apple in my pocket before I went out. When I got to the neighbor's, I fished the apple out, ducked under the fence rail, and walked up to the colt. He came right up to me and was a gentleman about eating the apple.

It's been years since I last interacted with a horse, be it riding, tacking up, feeding, or just sitting quietly with them. Today was heaven. It's been heaven since I got out here, but today was especially wonderful."
I marched and peacefully protested police brutality and the death of George Floyd with my community and it was such an amazing turnout. we don‚Äôt see that kind of solidarity coming from a small town in the south often at all so I have a renewed faith in my fellow citizens. That makes me immensely happy.
Delivered my bachelors degree today and got admitted to the university I wanted for my masters degree only 10 minutes after. It's been quite a nice day!
Not as good as everyone else‚Äôs but I got my first ace in rainbow six siege! I‚Äôm only rank 15 so I hope other siege players will understand how happy I was
Able to spend time with my sister. Sure we were only traveling to pick up a mattress in the middle of a storm but it's been a long time since we were able to chat in the same space since all the craziness the past few months.
I started a new job about a month ago. I‚Äôm starting to get a hang of things and today I accomplished a lot at work!
I got my son back from his dad today bc my work schedule has been so HECTIC the last six weeks that prevented me from being able to get my son from day care....for six weeks. It was wonderful getting my little dude back. ‚ù§Ô∏è I missed him so much
My art supplies are coming early. Not a big thing, but this means I'll have the proper supplies to draw so I can commission stuff online. This is the first time I'm really able to do this, and I'll be able to help my mom out a little bit, since it's not like I have much necessities for myself to pay for, but her on the other hand, she's pregnant. It means I'll have more money for cosplay and stuff, too. I'm more excited than happy, but i guess they are pretty similiar
So my whole life ive always struggled to do basic math up to the point that drove me to serious depression, and bullying from students and teachers. Till i did some research and found out that there is people having the exact same problems that i have, i then realized that i wasnt im fact stupid but that i just needed the proper help and i just had something called ‚ÄúDyscalculia‚Äù
My Kung fu class (over zoom right now) had a dance party thing, and people got to dress up in weird, funny costumes. It was really nice to see everyone happy

Day 5 of having 2 precious new kittens.  They've REALLY opened up in the last 48 hours and are getting comfy in their new home.  They're super sweet and playful.
"I‚Äôve been going through some tough personal problems and I under stand I need to practice my social distancing but being able to go out with my few extremely close friends today was really nice and relaxing even though it has to be cut short it was still a whole lot of fun being as a friend I can see often managed to hang out with us :)

Hearing my mom laugh out loud with happiness despite her alzheimer's while we were having a conversation
My roommate and I recently agreed to pay rent in cash. A day before rent day, I didnt counted the rent money my roommate gave me. Later, I noticed she was short by $20 and regretted not checking first. Told her what happened and it seemed like I wouldnt get the $20 because she was convinced she give me the correct amount of money, but she later surprised me by finding a $20 bill in her car and giving it to me.  Im so happy i have a good roommate because she could have lied to me. It could have been a $20 lesson, but still learned I should always check.
The girl I've been seeing (mostly digitally, but one really nice socially distant picnic) hinted that she's excited to see me again. And we text a solid amount. It ain't much but she's really keeping the ol' heart ticking.
I planted two trees for a woman from my yoga community and then I picked up a dying house plant from a woman through my local gardening group‚ÄîI think all three trees will live.

"My kid said mama. He‚Äôs seven months old. 

He‚Äôs been saying, ‚Äúmmmmma!‚Äù Lately when I leave the room or put him down. 

But today when he woke up, he looked at me with that gummy smile with the tiny little tooth pokin out the bottom, and he cheesed so hard and kicked his fat little legs so hard, and he said the magic word.

I‚Äôm a first time mom and I‚Äôm hooked. I live for these little tiny baby moments. If I didn‚Äôt know I was so in love with him before, that just did it for me. Kid‚Äôs awesome. My little bitty best friend."
I bounced back to come out no worse for wear mentally than when I went in. That's not always guaranteed, especially recently.
I got new fish! :) It‚Äôs my first time having a pet and I am really really happy! My fish are named Nebula and the Mafia! The Mafia includes the Godfather, Mafioso, Donny, Badabing, and Badaboom. :)
I was able to run two and a half miles without stopping :). Just last week I could barely run a mile. I'm in the middle of summer workouts btw.
Finally talked to the person who fucked my life over. I told them what they did to me and they actually apologized. It made me feel great. Now I‚Äôve started working on myself to finally regain what i lost that day.
"My wife smiled at me. 

She does it almost every day, and it always makes me happy. Yes, even when we have been arguing."
I‚Äôm always late to answer these awesome questions! Here‚Äôs mine anyway: my wife is a firefighter/paramedic and her covid results came back negative!!
My dad survived a ruptured colon and is on the mend. I cannot visit him until he is out of the hospital but today I feel so incredibly happy.
My best friend and I saw this chihuahua puppy sticking it‚Äôs head out of a moving car and we both ‚Äúawwwed‚Äù simultaneously and the said: ‚Äúit so ugly tho‚Äù AT THE SAME TIME! It was amazing.
"Ok so here goes, I had voted for Trump in 2016 because I thought he would be different. It was the first election where I had really gotten into politics and started delving deeper into the folks who were already in congress and senate and saw the cracks and flaws in the Democratic party. Although Trump was like a 16 year old trying to express his ideas of policies I agreed with him in his ideas and how he treated the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù even though I knew he wouldn‚Äôt be perfect with the way he expressed things I figured maybe something different would bring new ideas and change. 

Fast forward and at every roadblock and challenge this man has failed so miserably it almost makes me tear up, the experiment that is a Republic/Democracy that our forefathers had fought for was being shitted on. Now I also understood that really since the turn of the 20th century politicians and individuals in power spit in the face of how beautiful the idea of democracy is and was. But what makes this man so despicable to me is how horrendously bad of a leader and Representative he is.

A leader is steadfast in his decision making and leads from the front but more importantly sets the example for what others should do including and most importantly doing the right thing!! and showing humanity. 

What happened today that made me happy was my best friend shedding a tear today when we met briefly for a talk. He always respected my right to an opinion and decision when it came to the election and stayed my best friend but when I finally told him I regret that decision and that it would really haunt me he started crying and hugged me. When I asked him why he said ‚ÄúThe fact that when things got really bad in the world and your conscience shined through everything else, that lets me know the kind of character and person you are...‚Äù 

Sorry for the long post but I just felt I needed to let that out. Thank You for listening and stay safe."
I figured out that since I took the initiative to pay $150 more a month to go to my car loan, I will be debt free before I am 30 y.o.
I planted some flowers called Vinca Cora. My grandmother was named Cora and she loved flowers and gardening. She even had a favorite blouse the same color of bright pink as the flowers. She was one smart, funny lady and this is just another way to remember her.
My brother and uncle watched some of my YouTube videos while I was pretending to be asleep, knowing they would never acknowledge my creations while me being awake they did while I was asleep. I didn't knew there was such thing as a soul smiling and laughing but I realized it does happen and I was smiling all the way.
I complimented someone on thier fine work in knifemaking and expressed a desire too see such creations appreciated and shared. They responded with gratitude and determination too give thier best efforts in creating beutiful culinary masterpieces.
I finally had what you‚Äôd consider a relatively solid dump instead of the brown rain I‚Äôve had the last 3 weeks
Today was the first day I‚Äôve seen the sun in almost 3 months, and it was because my old best friend decided to hang out with me. It‚Äôs been a really rough time and I haven‚Äôt felt this happy in so long. I hope you all have the same happiness that I felt today.
"I took a giant therapy llama and alpaca to visit my residents at their bedroom window in the nursing home I work at. Their faces were  priceless. 

‚ÄúIS THAT A HORSE AT MY WINDOW?!‚Äù"
I finally figured out my paternal grandmother‚Äôs last name so I could work on that side of the family tree! Now if only I could figure out why it seems like her ex-husband (my grandfather) didn‚Äôt exist before he enlisted in WWII.
Our interns started yesterday and I got to host a Family Feud game for them and they all said I did really well and were very thankful :)

I shot an 89 making my last three rounds an 89 and 87 and an 89. Consistently breaking 90. I am happy.
I received a $3 tip in cash on top of the regular $6 pay on the app, and when I picked up my next order from Arby‚Äôs, I planned on using that $3 plus 79 cents of my own coins to buy a large milkshake, but then the worker gave me the shake for free. This meant that I got $6.79 worth of tip on top on the $6 initial pay of the delivery.
My three year old nephew took a video of himself walking around in the backyard and set the phone down and whipped it out and peed right next to the phone. Then he pulled up his undies and pants and picked up the phone and continued talking to himself. His mom happened to find it while deleting all his videos. It was so funny seeing his little pee stream almost hit the camera lmao.
I got to meet chickens as part of mentoring for getting urban chickens! They were so curious and friendly! :)
My daughter just graduated from middle school. They held a virtual promotion ceremony due to Covid-19 where families watched a pre-recorded event. It was bittersweet as she has been at this school since age 2.5 (she‚Äôs now 14). She has known most of these kids for virtually her entire life. It was sweet to listen to the memories that impacted these kids and left an impression. Little things that they have done or said to each other that at the time seemed like nothing in kindergarten but 9 years later finding out that it made a difference. Smiles and happy tears.
I‚Äôm a voiceover artist and was booked for a job.  It‚Äôs been so slow since Covid and I was psyched to work today.
"My sister and I spent her birthday teaching my 7 year old daughter how to play Pokemon Go.
Her joy was infectious. Every time she caught one she jumped and cheered."
A little kid came up and ordered a snowcone, he told us to put whatever on it. When we gave him his snowcone his eyes widened and he said, ‚ÄúOMG this is the best snowcone!!!‚Äù I literally could not stop smiling.
I did an artistic nude photoshoot for the first time ever and as an insecure shy person that was a huge accomplishment and I‚Äôm so happy I stepped out of my boundaries!
Took my first overnight studies today for my sleep disorder! One step closer to determining what exactly I have and how to treat it.
Today the clinic called me to schedule my mum's first radiotherapy session. She's already had a surgery to fully remove the breast tumor and she didn't have to undergo chemotherapy. So many blessings so far. She starts tomorrow and I'm hopeful. I've been keeping her company through this journey and I'm glad I can help her when she's already done so much for her children.
Drove down to Southern Utah with my sister and my brother in law, hiked the narrows, saw a ghost town, and now set up camp before dinner so all in all today‚Äôs been a pretty good day!

I've been running the childcare for essential employees in our area and today we did water rockets and it worked very well and everyone had a lot of fun it was super cool
I was able to drive my car for the first time today after not using it for over a year. Several mechanical issues plus the inability to pay for that or the registration meant I had to keep borrowing family cars which I hate to do. Needless to say I'm very happy today.
I just bought my little sister a plane ticket to come and live with me! I‚Äôve been feeling lonely lately and I can‚Äôt wait to spend time with her!
I made my stepdad laugh real hard. I told him ‚Äúdid you know lions can be gay?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúoh, I didn‚Äôt know that. That‚Äôs fascinating.‚Äù Then I said ‚Äúyeah, they have real gay pride.‚Äù He got a kick out of that
Did a DJ set for my neighborhood (on my front porch) and live streamed it on Facebook!!!  Just trying to bring something positive in these dark times.
The office manager at the plastic surgeon‚Äôs office where I work noticed the weight I‚Äôve lost this year and complimented me. So nice to have that kind of validation!
My girlfriend came home from work and immediately started munching on the stuffed Paprika I made this evening. She‚Äôs cute when she gets fed.
Nothing much to report today, although yesterday was quite happy, but I hope to see this question repeat on this subreddit, it‚Äôs really heartwarming to see people telling happy stories here.
I started my 6 day vacation. It's the most days off I've in a row since I graduated highschool 9 years ago.
I was able to give my 2 hens a bunch of corn on the cob and sweet peppers. They get super happy and excited and I love to see their joy.
My cat has been kind of sick and really aggressive because of a bladder thing for the last two months basically. Today was the first day he was able to go outside and it was nice to see him happy and lounging in the sun, being gentle with people and other animals.
I bought myself my first drill to use at work and at home. A Milwaukee compact kit with a bit set including magnetic bits. Made my cream when I unboxed it
"I‚Äôve been waking up early to watch TV shows with my friend on Netflix. We live in different time zones (I‚Äôm in Korea and she‚Äôs in the UK).

My boyfriend hugged me tightly while singing me a love song, I've never felt so comforted and loved in a simple, physical way before.
(Spoilers) I was watching Re:Zero for the first time and the mc (Subaru) was kinda cringy, until the final episode of season 1 he wasn't as useless as before and he finally confessed his love to Emilia, 10/10 would recommend.
I barely ever talk to my dad and older brother. We had an impromptu conference call and talked for like an hour. It felt really good üòå
Got told they want me to go from from seasonal to full time at work and I managed to get my internet installed the day I move into my new place!

"It's a small thing, but a streamer on twitch said goodbye to me when I had to leave to let my phone charge.

I dunno if it's because I'm kind of a regular viewer or if he just does it whenever he sees someone is leaving in chat but it still made me happy. That and chatting with the other nice people in chat.

I don't think he has reddit, but if he does and he somehow sees this then thanks sparky!"
I got my Furlough money through!! Turn's out sitting at home all day is the best paid job I've ever had.

I have been really depressed about the situation of the country and my mom texted me this morning and it helped me out. My family rarely reaches out to me, I am initiating 90+% of the time. It was nice.
We reopened yesterday. I work at a child care center and the stories from the kids who potty trained made me smile! They were so proud to tell me they had underwear on and go poop in the potty!

To scared to do it myself I‚Äôve been putting off my dogs nail trim for a long time .Dog grooming salons are booked for the next month but my dog (Yorker Westie mix) need a nail  trim BAD.

A local Bubble Tea shop celebrated their 3rd birthday, and they have a special tea with multi flavored boboa, sprinkles, and a Kabob stick with a mini cupcake, several round marshmallows, and a big round gummy covered in sprinkles on it. They only do them this one day a year and I scored three for the second year in a row.
I slept more than 4 hours for the first time in almost a year. I have pretty bad insomnia, so it‚Äôs a rare occurrence for me to get to sleep quickly and stay asleep for longer than a few hours.
The 5 dollar scratch off lotto ticket I had, won me 25 dollars. Put a smile on my face after this last week.

"This post. 

Because it made me remember there are happy parts of my day, despite it being shrouded in self-doubt and anxiety. The dinner with my in-laws, the kiss with my amazing girlfriend, the sweet release after a few days of constipation. It‚Äôs the the little things. 

‚ÄòTis a dangerous avenue when you over synchronize your self-worth with productivity."
I was tired this morning, but I got my Fat ass up and went to the gym. I ate well, I worked hard at my job, I joked with my coworkers, I listened to my favorite podcasts, and I smiled. Sometimes we have to make what is considered an ordinary day, and realize that ordinary can be extraordinary
I finally disconnected from a very unhealthy, toxic relationship after years of guilt and shame. Blocked it. Wow. What a feeling. It‚Äôs over.
"I found an Attack on Titan game for Oculus Quest on the SideQuest store. It's simple, but amazing.

It's called Attack on Quest for anyone wondering."
"Found a teammate in a video game I play regularly. Our playstyles clicked immediately and we went on an 8-0 run before calling it. 

Feels good in an otherwise usually toxic game"
I work collections. It fucking sucks but it's a job. But today was a good day. I was reminded that even though I'm collecting, I can still improve someone's life just by listening, providing sympathy, and keeping a helpful tone.
"I just got into my new apartment after about a year of struggling and three different residences!

I moved out just before I turned 16. I attended college and worked part-time. My SO worked full time and did college.

My first place was on a farm, couldn't leave the driveway for the entire winter, got gassed out by our landlords diesel projects in the garage next to us. The guy was nice, but a shit landlord.

Second place was with a very mentally unstable roommate who ended partying 24/7, eventually costing us a shit ton in repairs and a lease.

The third was my girlfriend's abusive fathers house, plaid the long con of being nice, but once we were trapped he went back to his old ways. Long story short had to get the law involved so we could move out safely. 

Fourth place, I moved back in my dad's house. Was okay, but very small room, and two siblings (13 and 16) who are getting drug addictions and in lots of trouble. There were a total 9 people living there with 4 rooms. Not terrible.

My spouse and I haven't had a proper place to study almost our entire college career. As of today, my desk: https://imgur.com/a/KG8NgNy

Tl;dr Hadn't had a nice place to stay for a few years, struggled with college, have a new apartment and everything is so insanely perfect :) new desk too"

"A stranger paid for over $300 worth of life saving medications I take daily.
He paid for enough medicine for the entire month. I didn't know what to say or do I was wearing a mask and my work uniform and all I could do was thank him before returning to work."
I couldn't afford new bikes for my kids (they've grown too big for their old ones) so I got them scooters. I was worried they would be disappointed but they had a blast and are excited to get better with them!
My husband calls me every day after he gets off of work to make sure ive had an okay day and to see if he needs to stop and get anything on his way home. Well today, I guess he could tell in my voice that something was off and I had a crappy day. He gets home, and he got me a bag of my favorite chips c: made me feel so much better because I didnt even say anything about having a weird day lol. He just knew.
My boyfriend and I went on our first date in awhile. Part of that was going bowling where I bowled my best game with a score of 112!

"My four year-old neighbour, Eliza, came over for a masked, backyard social distance visit.  Eliza and her family have a new dog and we were discussing dog names.  


Eliza told me her Grandma has 28 dogs (actually 6) and started naming them.  She told me one dog is named ""Hot Guy"".  I was marveling about the awesome Grandma, picturing her out on her porch, calling ""Hot Guy, Hot Guy, get in here, now!"".  


I thought about the things I say to and about my own dog, and thinking of renaming him from Mack to Hot Guy so I could say something like, ""Hot Guy is sitting on my lap"" and ""Come on Hot Guy, it is time for bed"" and even, ""Hot Guy your butt stinks!""  (He is a Boston Terrier - farts can bring the house down).  


Turns out Grandma's dog is named Hawkeye.  But we spent a whole day laughing and it was awesome to be light-hearted.  


Dogs are awesome and kids are great!"

And then I bought myself tacos from my local (and boarded-up) shop to top it all off üëåüåÆüåÆüåÆ"
I'm nine months pregnant and depressed, so I haven't been able to find the motivation to do much at all. Today, I took my kids to daycare, worked eight hours, and picked my kids up from daycare. It really wasn't a lot, but it gave my self-esteem a huge boost.

I held myself accountable for a binge eating episode. I wrote down all the calories I ate as I ate them instead of hiding away in my psychological hole and pretending like I‚Äôm not overeating. Good first step. Had a 3,100 calorie binge.
"I actually managed to get some school work done today. Bit difficult for me usually because of my complete lack of concentration, but managed to write around 2000 words and get up to date on my coursework. Edit: That feeling of closing all the tabs after you've finished the work is what made me the most happy I think.

My friend also made a meme about me. Sounds stupid lol, but somehow something as simple as knowing your friend was thinking about you even when you weren't talking to them is nice :)"

I learned that playing recordings of adult bird calls to baby songbirds can soothe them a lot while they‚Äôre being rehabilitated because it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre listening to their own parents, and for some it allows them to learn special songs! It was so cute to watch baby birds stare at me wide-eyed all afternoon while I played them recordings of what they‚Äôll sound like some day. ü•∞

(Or something along those lines) so I got some praise from my boss which was nice. :)"
I quit my job in the beginning of March before everything started closed due to covid because I got a new job. The new job rescinded the offer at the end of April and I was devastated because I live in a major city with no income and no unemployment due to quitting my job voluntarily. This week I got an offer at a new job and today I got approved for my dream apartment. Things are starting to look up.
I‚Äôm kinda late to this thread so idk if anyone is gonna see this. But today when I went grocery shopping, I bought my dog this new toy and he freaked the fuck out for like 10 minutes when he started playing with it! There hasn‚Äôt been a ton in my life to make me happy in the last 2 years or so but my Rocket-man has made me so fucking happy I love him so much!
"My baby kitten that looked like a newly hatched chick when we brought her home fell asleep besides me. She is 4 months and weights 4.2 lbs now.
She is growing and only getting even cuter every day.
Also she gave me rimworm, but we both healed now.

We brought her home after my 14 year old pup died and I think she is a worthy heir."
I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face. It‚Äôs been a really long time since I could laugh like that.
My toddler pulled a carrot from the garden and realised where our carrots come from. He rushed inside to get the carrots in the fridge and was holding them both up in comparison with the widest grin ever.
The cutest little baby Australian Shepherd ate the flowers off my porch, and just as he was getting in trouble, I intervened with pets and snuggles. Met a cool new neighbor out of the deal and told her that sweet guy can eat all my flowers.
My best friend cross-stitched and sent to me the likeness of my very sassy dog with the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fucking delight‚Äù on it. Made my day.
I deleted both Facebook and Instagram accounts. Happy? Yes. A little lost as well? Yes. However, this is the beginning of no longer being a slave to lies and deception.
I took a nap and didn't have to hear how life is going to hell. For 3hrs and 34min I was in a state of blank serenity free from worry and strife............then I woke up buuuut I'mma turn in soon for the night.
"My brother just moved out of our abusive mother's house and my sister and I the eldest brother helped him move all his stuff.
 We got to hang out in the park, had Boba and Frozen Yogurt in a nice sunny day.
 We are all happy to finally have this moment of commencement, and that we get to move on with our lives into better things together."
My girlfriend told me she loved me and can‚Äôt wait to see me again. She‚Äôs visiting her family in another country. Always makes me feel good.
"A month ago I saw a female duck get gang duck raped... I assumed she was impregnated and just hoped to see her and her ducklings when they hatched..... well today, I saw her and the [ducklings](https://imgur.com/a/VM26vs0) !  

And she chased away to male ducks when I was feeding her. You go girl!"
My brother he walked into my room and asked to borrow my phone, I asked what‚Äôs up he just said ‚ÄúI bought us wings.‚Äù Whata dude.
"After reading all the doom and gloom news from last night, got an unexpected IM from a coworker that just said 
>OOOO My new computer speakers just got delivered!

Took everything I could muster to not bust out laughing in my cubicle. (Yes, coworker was WFH)"
"I read the replies to this post. 

Today was a rough day... thank you fellow Redditors for making me smile."
I saw this post and decided to start a little daily journal of writing at least one good thing that makes me happy everyday! Today‚Äôs is that I decided to start this, and that I made my moms recipe for spicy cabbage (which I love and haven‚Äôt had in a long time since I live 6 hours away from her now)
I took a walk in my local park and the children's play area had been closed off since what feels like forever. Well, today I finally saw kids playing there again, all within a safe distance. But I saw their smiles again.
Boyfriend and I went out onto our Queens apartment stoop to peacefully protest the curfew with signs when a guy who lives down the block passed by with his friend and asked to take our picture and chat with us. Turns out his sister lives in our building and they‚Äôre all Nepalese. We all ended up sitting (distantly) on the stoop drinking cold Bud Lights he offered us and talking for over an hour about life in the US. It was an unexpectedly beautiful moment.
Had to work. I hate my job. I'm anti social and depressed. The situation the country is in is awful.  I work with shallow, unintelligent people and I hate it. I haven't slept more than 2 hours in like 3 weeks. My meds don't work any more. Fuck. I just keep waking up to everything being more and more insane.
My car started for the first time in a while after completely taking it apart, to them go on and not want to shut off... had to disconnect the battery to get it to shut off...
Protesters in my area were peaceful, police acted with professionalism and compassion, and nothing was burned to the ground.  Good day.
I got on an online game for the first time in about 4 years and it was an amazing experience. I met a dude and we became friends! I left because of the anger and toxicity. I was diagnosed with manic bipolar disorder 3 years ago and I finally got on my medication and stayed on it. I lived with so much negativity and emotional turmoil that I could barely handle normal society.
My daughter, who is four, made our neighbor a bracelet. The neighbor is a 6 year old boy she has a crush on. The awkwardness of her attempt to give him the bracelet, and his reaction were pretty funny. Reminded me of an easier time in my life.
My friend FINALLY understood how hurtful it is to say ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù in response to ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù
"I received gifts today from 3 different friends from 3 different countries. It was a great surprise :)

It's the wishlist gifting surprise thing that we're doing!"
Played 8 hours of league with some online friends. Never met any of them before but it‚Äôs really cool talking to someone everyday and not get tired of them
My parents bought a 10-pack of toilet paper from China and each roll was about 1/4 of the size of a typical toilet paper roll. Each roll was so ridiculously small that we laughed about it for five minutes.
My little two year old sister gave me some popcorn with a smile on her face. She really loves popcorn and is usually very very very selfish with it.
Made my best friend laugh whose been worried about financial problems and getting an internship, I made a goofy picture and sent her and she couldn't stop laughing
My grandma was being annoying so my sister took me out to a park to walk around and get away from the house for a while
I work alot. Single dad. Got to hug my kids and tell them goodnight tonight. Great way to end the day.
My dad has been feeding a raccoon off of his deck for a few weeks and today she brought three baby raccoons with her and my brother sent me a video.
My brother began to reconcile with my mom after a decades-long disagreement. I haven‚Äôt felt this kind of hope in a long time.
Realizing I love my newborn with every fibre of my being as I watched him sleeping. He looks so peaceful. I‚Äôve never been this happy.
Me and a long time friend are going to play Minecraft soon! We haven‚Äôt talked in ages and we used to play Minecraft together years ago.
I saw my childhood best friend today at his first job interview. Big news! He got the job! I‚Äôm so proud of him!
It was birthday and I got to see family for the first time I a long time with some restrictions being lifted in my state.
Today, our cantankerous 4 year old Chihuahua/Beagle mix started playing with our our 6 month old Chihuahua/German Shepard puppy for the first time. It‚Äôs been a week of them not getting along very well, so this was great to see.
I dislocated my knee recently and today was the first day I was able to go on a walk (I still have a little limp tho üòÅ)
Cleaned the back yard, mowed the lawn, and threw some steaks on the grill!  Still loving being stuck at home.
"There‚Äôs a really cool lightning storm that‚Äôs been going on for more than an hour, the sky hasn‚Äôt stopped flickering once. It‚Äôs awesome. There was a bolt that looked like a spiral that was really cool. Watching it reminds me of when I was a lot younger maybe 6 or 7, and i was with my grandparents at their cottage. There was a lightning storm happening and the power went out (it was in the night) I was kinda scared at the time. So we sat in the main sitting area of the cottage where there was a big window that overlooked smallish lake and just watched the lightning while cuddling together. I remember calming down significantly, mesmerized by the shapes and flashes. There was one that went into the lake and the whole lake light up very brightly. It took your breath away. That night I also experienced some of the loudest thunder I have ever experienced, but somehow sitting there with my grandparents, I wasn‚Äôt that scared 

So I guess what made me happy is remembering that one distant, almost forgotten memory with my grandparents."
"I work patient placement at a major hospital in a bbn large area. Basically, if you're admitted in the hospital,  it's my job to assign what room you're going to, which nurse takes care of you, and who your doctor will be during your stay. 
It can be incredibly stressful,  today was one of those days. 

We were FULL. Every room in the hospital had a patient in it. No one was being dismissed so I had to hold people in the Emergency Room for an average of 8 hours to get placement. 

At the end of my third 12hour shift of this mayhem I managed to place everyone in a room and made the average wait time 10 minutes.  

Happy patients makes happy nurses. Happy nurses makes for better healing. I love helping heal people, both patients physically and staff mentally."
First time posting.  Super tired terrible day at work but when I get home my boys always cheer ‚Äúdaddy is home‚Äù and give me be hugs.  My one year gets up from his nap and just starts smiling and runs to give me a hug.  Love it!
Finished my work, Played basketball, drank beer...i also didn't have to use my AK...I guess today was a good day.
My boss finally let me be a server at the restaurant i have been working at for a few months and it  went really well.
"I planted trees for the first time! Also had an awesome run. 

Lookout for any newly planted red cedar in Oregon. They might be my little guys!"
I got to sit down and talk to my brother (from a distance) for the first time in 4 months. It was so nice.
"I fed a peahen and peachick that live beside my house.  We have only recently become acquainted.  She is a graceful, yet cautious lady, and the peachick is just the cutest little hopper.

I forgot about most of the world‚Äôs troubles for about 8 minutes today."
I was starving & on a VC for work & my amazing partner went & got me a foot long meatball sub. That‚Äôs love üíï
It was yesterday, but the girl I like told me that I was her favorite person to talk to and that was the yearly compliment
My first-year uni students, without exception, kicked ass on their first presentations. Proud as hell of the hard work they put in.
Absolutely nothing, on the flip side there was absolutely nothing bad either. It was an uneventful, calm day during these crazy times and boi i missed my peace and quiet.
I went back to work after almost 3 months and didn't miss a beat. (background: FoH Food Service/Ohio, USA)
I am attending a conference for work virtually this week. My co-worker and I signed up to present when it was supposed to be an actual conference. We presented today and killed it. Felt pretty good.
I watched the new Eric Andre film ‚ÄòBad Trip‚Äô. Had a good belly laugh the whole time, and it was nice stress reliever right now
I got a perfect score on the Reading section of the accuplacer and did well on writing so now I can dual enroll at my local college at the age of 16!!!
Honestly I found $1600 yesterday but im still happy. It was long lost ‚Äúvegas money‚Äù that I guess I didnt lose hahaha
"My family had a gender reveal for my sister. It wasn't lost on me that we were privileged to do so and it really brought some sanity to our whole family. Take care of eachother. ""EQUALITY OF SOULS"" -probably someone badass but I have been saying it for years ‚ò∫"
I put my phone down and went to the dog park with my girlfriend and our dog. It was such a wonderful day.
Someone played Amazing Grace on the trumpet at a protest today and it made everyone pause for a moment.
Me and my coworker had a good laugh at a couple of work related activities while performing a system upgrade for a client.
"My mother who we are caring for at home and is deathly sick managed to surprise everyone and get out of bed for an hour. She went through photos with us as we sat with her. 
I‚Äôll always have my regrets about how much time I didn‚Äôt spend with her, but right now I‚Äôm so happy that we miraculously got just an hour of quality time together. 

Hold your loved ones close x"
"Probably way too late to the party for anyone to see this but it made me happy so - 

The guy who embezzled my dads company whilst he was on his deathbed and then proceeded to do so when my mother stepped in, one of the jobs he fucked them on turned up wrong. We now have the proof we need to chase it up above board. He‚Äôs been stung with a big ass bill that he needs to settle by Friday or we‚Äôll be taking it further. 

Revenge is best cold kids. Big shout out to me ma for warning me against going and doing what felt right at the time"
I was feeling down today at work and two of my coworkers hugged me and asked if I was okay. I felt cared for :)
I broke my toe a few days ago, but there are plenty of things during the day that make me happy, we've finally had a bit sun here and enjoying the fresh air and birdsong has been fantastic :)
Took my 2 year old to the beach with Mimi and pops. The smiles, laughter and squeals from on a child  playing in the waves and sand are priceless.
My high school finally found my transcripts so I can go to college in the fall! I graduated so very long ago in 2002 so it took them 2 months to find them. I'm guessing also due to the pandemic.
Reopened my clinic after it had been closed because of COVID....now to see the 3200 backlogged patients üò¨
My best friend/puppy/Frenchie had an exam by a veterinary surgeon and they said he doesn‚Äôt need surgery üíì

My cousin (who is my best friend and I haven‚Äôt seen in a while) got back in town and we went on a long run.
I got to hang out with a friend for a few hours today after she got off work. I haven't been able to see her in months between our jobs and the pandemic.
My 5 y/o is very proud of herself that she is strong enough to drag her 10 y/o brother across the floor. And the fact that he's all about her doing that cracks me up!
I finished the final draft of my thesis. This is my 6th year and it‚Äôs been exhausting. The past couple years have been full of shame because it‚Äôs taking me so long. Hopefully within the next couple weeks I‚Äôll be a bachelor in astrophysics.
"The person I‚Äôve been in a ‚Äòsituationship‚Äô with for the past month and I made it into a ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô today :) 

She‚Äôs my first official girlfriend!"
I knocked out a ten hour task in four hours. My back was bothering me, I was grumpy and I didn't even know where to start to fix this one bug. But I powered through with the help of a second cup of coffee and figured it out just after lunch.
Kinds negative but found out my ex wife‚Äôs life is in the absolute shitter. I know I should want good for her but I‚Äôm still a little bitter about her cheating and wiping the bank accounts when I filed for divorce. Karma
Seeing all these subreddits using their platform to give the Black community a stage ‚ù§Ô∏è Black lives matter!
A friend of mine got covid 19, So i spent hours of my day trying to make him happy, sending memes, sending virtual hugs, telling him that everything was gonna be okay and If he needs me, i'm just a call away. Now i know he's smiling, he's taking care of himself, and he knows that i'll be there whenever he needs me. (I'm a spanish spoken, i tried my best at writing this in english since y'all's comments are in that language, thanks for reading, good evening)
"First unemployment check arrived in the mail! I‚Äôm a restaurant manager who has another 6-8 weeks to go until reopen. 

S/O Florida for the 6wks pending approval"
I had a hot shower.... was also my kids birthday and thank goodness for technology bc I got to see him and watch him open and enjoy his presents while far Away. And I was formally promoted. Today was a good day.
My boyfriend and I found our neighbor‚Äôs cat after he went missing for three days and we were able to return him to her safe and sound.
A man was going around giving officers and protesters hugs at a protest. I wasn‚Äôt there but it was a beautiful video.

Edit: I just saw a video of a nurse that was split from her daughter's reunite with them"
Made a friend outside the whitehouse named Tyson. I noticed that he was playing ‚ÄúFuck Tha Police‚Äùon a small speaker, so I pulled out my forearm sized speaker and played my riot music playlist.

No new disease activity and no PML. Which is good news."
I found out my summer job is happening and 19 minutes later was offered a higher position for it. Haven‚Äôt heard back from my boss yet but I‚Äôm hoping the training for it won‚Äôt effect my families vacation that‚Äôs been planned for months and I mentioned during the hiring process early March. So we‚Äôll see probably in the morning how it‚Äôll work out ü§ûüèª
I woke up knowing my kids and I are safe (relatively speaking for now) living in a small town in the Midwest. Hard to breathe thinking of those in the opposite position
"I found out my daughter will graduate. 

She was a bit behind at the beginning of the year, and there was a delay in her electives this semester. She's been working her butt off, I'm so happy it's over."
Finally I got a raise, I will be able to pay my bills more easily and spend more time with my parents
Did a reddit live for the first tome and had a really amazing time. Also landed a crooked grind for the first time on that stream and felt hella good about myself.
I had lunch with a friend, something that he suggested. I know that‚Äôs such a minor thing, but it actually meant a lot because it‚Äôs pretty rare that I get invited to things/hang out with someone unless I initiate. Especially with the quarantine isolation, being with a friend and just talking about whatever while eating some nice Thai food and just relaxing.
Put together a computer. Just waiting on one more part and then the challenge of cable management shall begin.
literally nothing. i got awarded funniest thespian but it just feels bad because every day i come home from whatever and just depressed. i didnt win the one thing i was actually running for and i had a lot of homework. srry for the bad attitude.
I got recognized in my company newsletter as one of the top 2 performers for Q1. Super happy as I only just started there on Dec 2019.
I did pretty well on an interview that fits perfectly with my major. I don‚Äôt hear back till Thursday though... I also modified my backpacking pack to hold a first aid kit in a more convenient place and it turned out well.
I‚Äôm a bagger at a Publix (regional grocery store) and a lady who has been shopping there for many years bought a bunch of buy one get one free and gave the free one to a cashier she had befriended over her time shopping there.
We had an office meeting that lasted half the morning, and I didn‚Äôt need to pay attention. Been feeling overwhelmed was a nice break
I talked with my older sister that lives 15 hours away on the phone for a few hours about family. It made me feel whole.
I spent the day with my momma. Her body was working against her today, so we didn‚Äôt get to do much, but being with her was blessing enough.
I finally picked up guitar again after 10 years. Didn't do a ton but did some basic lessons and it was really fun!!
Found a sweet bird of paradise plant in my condo‚Äôs trash. Also went on a nice run for the first time in years.
"Just got an email from a prof, due a timing oopsie, one of the three major projects for our class was cancelled and we all get 100% on it.

üôÑ Also might be some additional satisfaction from the irony of a prof that can't take constructive criticism in a class whose major component is learning to take constructive criticism.  And after a particularly (ahem) snippy response when pointing out the reason everybody was mis-submitting assigniments was because they were following the syllabus, deciding to keep their mouth shut about something odd they saw in said syllabus when entering it into their online calendar.  Some kind of oopsie that would be easy to fix at the start of the semester but it wouldn't become obvious until the end of the semester. Where it would be impossible to fix. üôÑ"
My boss told me to leave the grill to go do something and said he had it, I come back and the order is burning
"Won a BR Solo today.

Everything else was crap. Wife may loose her nursing job because she spoke up about her being extremely unhappy with her position. So instead of helping her find something else that fits her better they will most likely fire her. So there's that."
"Broke up with my ex. Seems cynical, but things REALLY weren't working well between us (dead bedroom, among other things), and its wonderful to be free again.

The cherry on top is that it's been a super friendly, amicable, and low stress breakup. We're going to remain friends (after a few months apart) - which we both want. Among other variables I'm not going to get into. But God...I feel free and as if my life is in a better place than it has been in **years.**

This is a sad bookend to an important chapter in my life. But its also the start of a wonderful new one!"
We bought a house :) been grinding away at school and work to get to a level to afford a nice new house. Today was a good day and I feel like we have started a new chapter in life.
I learned that the DIN (drug identification number used by pharmacy databases in Ontario) for cannabis is 42000000.
I had a really bad mental health day and a friend of mine noticed and ordered me surprise Thai food. Almost brought me to tears
"I have been in a foreign country for almost a year now. I go down from where I live to this same cafeteria to get breakfast every morning, there are always the same 5 men working there, they barely speak English and I don‚Äôt speak any of their language. 

However we always say good morning to each other and they always manage to put me in a good mood. 

It‚Äôs kept me happy during these long months away from home."
We moved from Hawaii to Virginia in the midst of a pandemic. Today, after being in our new home for a month, we finally met some of our neighbors. It's been a pretty depressing move, so this was a great boost for us.
"im having a very tough time at home rn (i recently came out didnt go to well) and i told m friend how i felt so empty and useless cause all i did was a 10 min workout and they replied with ""but you got up, you are still here, breathing, fighting, living, and even while doing all that you still found time to workout, i think you are strong for that"" and it really made me happy for the first time in 5 months"
I saw a Facebook post about an old friend I knew while in the Army who is now a police officer, they were saying how kind and understanding he was and that he is how all officers should strive to be. It made me so proud to be able to have called him a friend.
"Protests in all 50 U.S. states today. 

For the first time in a while, it makes me proud to be an American."
My sister came out as trans and my parents were really accepting without hesitation. So that makes me feel better about the day when I get the courage to come out as ace and demifemale and change my name
Today it's been three years since my dad passed from a brutal cancer. I woke up with a heavy heart in what's supposed to be a shitty melancholic day, then I turned to cooking. I made my first sourdough bread and it turned out surprisingly great! I had no hopes it would be even edible, but it's actually the best bread I've ever baked! Such a small thing but It made me genuinely happy and hopeful.
I got to be inside a school today for the first time in months (I never thought I‚Äôd be saying I was glad to be in a school but here we are)
"I hosted a call on zoom about protester safety and what to do when you spot looters. 50 hours over 4 days of planning and coordination finally done.

I am so tired but I finally got to show 100 protesters in my city how to be safe.

I need a beer and a good 12 hours sleep.

I'm happy."
Found out today that even though my furlough has been extended a few months, I still officially have a job to go back. At least for now and that's all that matters at the moment. Huge relief.
I‚Äôm gonna shoot ya straight here boss.  There ain‚Äôt much to be happy about right now.  Kinda in a slump.
I participated in a protest which made me feel like I am actually part of something bigger than myself
I made a window box for my cat over the weekend. I wasn't sure if the cat was using it while I was at work, so I put a security camera in there and my cat used it for 4 hours to nap in.
My baseball practice got canceled today because my coach couldn‚Äôt make it but I still went, 1. because my little brother still had practice 2. My dad and I were planning on playing catch while waiting for my little brothers practice to end. Luckily one of the older groups let me practice with them for the day, it did indeed excite me especially because some of my friends from house ball last year were on that team.
i moved into a new house two days ago and i only realized today that it's a 20 minute bike ride to my work! i'm going to be so fit this summer!!
Went to a peaceful protest, saw some friends/colleagues there I haven‚Äôt seen in months, saw an awesome dog.
I've been talking to my ex alot because we are still friends. Today she needed help and I was the fist person she called because she trusted me and knew I'd help her. So I got to help out a friend
Quit my job last week. Suggested an exit interview which I had today. Told my manager's manager that she was the reason I was quitting and spent an hour and a half detailing her incompetence.
"I had a full meal today, I found some great new online clothing stores to shop at after finding out that my favourite one was against black lives matter, I spoke to my friend & girlfriend (my two favourite people in the world), and I finally felt good with my own appearance while wearing a new outfit.
I think today was a pretty happy :)"
Last month my bf left me, he left the apartment where we lived together and I was really depressed, as a consequence, I barely ate and showered. Today gas bill arrived and it was less than 30% of the usual amount. That made my day!

Got to hangout with friends after a few months of not seeing them due to work and covid. And we broke out a new boardgame called mansions of madness. Super great boardgame with friends
I feel so welcomed and appreciated and cared for at my new job. So much so that today I texted my new boss about how happy I am with her and everyone else and she returned the good vibes by saying that they‚Äôre lucky to have me.
I got a little dressed up, put on makeup and attempted to curl my hair (unsuccessful as it does NOT hold a curl) to go hit the 3 local thrift stores and Sam's Club... People treat you much nicer when you look nicer! (Scored a Fiestaware creamer for $3! And got the velvet hangers I was seeking to unpack summer clothes to decide what needs to go to consignment!) Then I came home and made blended Watermelon cocktails with some fruit I cubed earlier and watermelon/cucumber vodka!
Took a walk through the neighborhood with my 5yo during an afternoon work break. We've been struggling to find a rhythm as a single parent and only child both at home all day during Covid, but today just worked.
Not today, but a couple days back I got back in contact with a good online friend who had deleted his old discord account couple many months back after saying some vague ominous troubles plaguing his mind. Sadly his life isn't doing to well mentally, but I'm so relieved I didn't lose him forever, I get to be there to help him through life.
After I cried in the bathroom reading about the lives lost to recent protest I watched an episode of Too Cute, and the puppies made me smile bigger than I have in a while
Me and the boys are celebrating a bday. We're not all related but we grew up together so were brothers in my mind. He turns 22 today.
Supporting a guy upset in the park and later him asking if I wanted to play some frisbee with him and his 2 buddies. We did . Felt old school, like kids again in a pre- COVID time in the park.
"There was a group of four baby Robbins on my door step this morning!
I also realized that it is my cake day which Means it has been one year since I tried to commit suicide. Thank you people of reddit for bringing me so much joy!!"
Me, my wife, and my daughter went on a bike ride and scooter ride around town. Then, we are dinner on the town square. Wonderful evening.
Reading all these posts on this thread is the one positive thing today that made me happy! Thank you all for sharing your happy moments!!
This is such a great and positive exercise! I keep what‚Äôs called a ‚ÄúYear of Smiles‚Äù jar that I where I put a note of 1 thing a day that made me smile. It‚Äôs a positive way to end the day, a super fun to look over at the end of the year, and helpful in disparaging times. I recommend it! I just use a simple mason jar on my dresser to do it.
my crush is actually breaking up with her douche bag boyfriend and leaving her fake friends thank god!
I‚Äôve started losing weight again after gaining a bunch during the quarantine. It‚Äôs not much but gotta start somewhere
I went outside to watch the protesters and ran into an old friend and ended up marching with the people for a couple hours. It was soooo chill.
I met a good friend online. As an introvert and someone who really sucks at socializing, it means a lot to me.
Three little kids knocked on my door this afternoon selling random fun-size packs of candy. Bought a single pack of MnMs and ate them for dessert :)
I'm new to reddit. It would be cool if I could have good conversation off here. Happiness is hope for tomorrow
"I‚Äôm feeling a little depressed so my boyfriend is ditching work for the afternoon so we can go have coffee, do some retail therapy & spend some time together.

So very grateful to be with a man who keeps my mental health a priority."
Had medium level anxiety all day, but reading a Reddit thread about anxiety, seeing how many people experience it, helped me feel not alone/abnormal, a huge weight off my chest. Thank you Reddit :)
While explaining my plan to a co-worker i accidently draw a shape that resembled a penis, like the ones you draw in middle school... I noticed and we chuckled
"It‚Äôs my birthday today and my family is taking no chance in forgetting to wish. Every five seconds I hear, HAPPPPIIEEEEEBIIRRTHHDAAYYYYTOOOOOYOUUUUU
Just made my day"
Discovered Post Malone and his latest album called Hollywood Bleeding. I‚Äôm a punk/metal through and through. I scratch my throat with baby lullabies when I was young. But I didn‚Äôt know Post has that talent regardless of his lyrics (some are nice actually). It made me dance, it made me constantly smiling after a bad break up. I appreciate his talent and creativity.
I was invited to a group chat with my 2 best friends since middle school who I havent kept up with much. We laughed and chatted like old times, they remembered me.
"I found a new gaming YouTube channel that picked me up out of a depression I've been feeling for a week now. Just about cried when I realized I was actually smiling and laughing for the first time in a while. 

It's the small things that seem to make the biggest difference"
Hundreds of people in my small suburban town joined together to protest systematic racism in support of Black Lives Matter. It was beautiful.
I spent the day in Tomales Bay and in the redwoods... So nice to get away for a day... before curfew and while sheltering in place and it is was beautiful and it was 80 degrees.  Happy.
I jut graduated in animation and my classmates and I finally got see the fruits of our labor on our completed year long short film project.
My twitch stream had an average viewership of 6, and I had a few people in there chatting with me. It made me very happy. :-)
A professor sent me a mail asking for my CV, he does this to the best students of his class so he can recommend us if somebody asks him.
I did a good thing. My friends did a good thing. I felt closer to God. I could smile because of love and how beautiful life is when you live in peace and in the presence of God. Religions are not the truth. God is the truth. If you look for Him if you really do. You will find him. And you will be happy and peaceful. I love God. I love life. And I love fighting for kindness.
I built a tent with sheets that covered the entire living room for my 2 year old son. He had so much fun laying in there eating popcorn and watching cars 3
"I work as a home health aide. I had a client today who is back from rehab after 5 weeks.  She glumly remarked that she would need to check on her cactus plants tomorrow, as they hadn't been watered in weeks and she hadn't checked on them yet. I got up, walked into the other room and lo and behold they were all perfectly fine. The look on her face when I told her, ""You're lucky you didn't pick orchids, your cactus are all fine,"" that is why I do my job. She was so freakin' delighted. She was even happier when she realized  that the aide coming tomorrow can water them for her."
Finally got out of debt to Tom Nook, only to find out that he puts you into more debt. That made me laugh and I'm not telling my brother.
"My son graduated.  

Born two months after 9-11, graduated in a parking lot during a pandemic and race riots, while the President spouts fascism from a bunker in the White House."
My best friend has been driving shitty cars that always seem to fall apart on her for the past four years, and today she was finally able to buy a barely used 2018 model. The smile on her face when she showed me it made my entire week.
Finally got a paid remote internship position after 100+ applications and my original summer internship being canceled due to Covid. Grateful that I can worry about finances less while still getting some work experience in!
A massive storm came and knocked out muy power and because of the storm, frogs were coming near my back glass sliding window and my cat saw them. The frogs didn't make me happy, but seeing my cat happy made me happy.
One teacher.. LITERALLY ONE changed the entire trajectory of my life. From nearly expelled to graduate school. Unfathomably undervalued and underpaid, a good teacher who makes learning fun is the shizletonschamwham!
Tell my kids to the park and was able to how about my parents despite the dysfunction in my marriage family is everything
I finally got to spend an entire day with my gf and her family. Indian families are sometimes very orthodox, so it was kinda like a whole new step for us. Haven't been able to stop smiling whenever I think about it.
My gym opened up and I got my first workout in, my boss called to discuss bringing me back to work soon, and tomorrow is my birthday. All good things!
I was sitting alone in the park feeling kind of shitty and this cute dog came up to me for pats and the owner was really nice
"My doofus of a dog got so excited to see me that she flung herself onto a chair next to me and nearly flung herself off it as well but I managed to catch her in time

I had only been in my room for an hour with the door shut 

There are two other people in the house who were in the same room as her

I‚Äôd hardly been in my room the whole day before that with her"
My husband helped me with my first essay as an online college student. I have been afraid to go back to school to finish my degree, and he knew that so he showed me the ropes of upper division online college.  It made me really happy.
My 4yr old son headbanging to 90's metal, him laughing his butt off at my making goofy faces & voices, my daughter finally being able to spend some time with a friend, finding the last remaining chocolate ice cream in the freezer.
I finished an assignment at work today and the top boss is pleased with it! Will be a supervisor soon and getting an employee under me to manage. :)
Been a quite day for me BUT my wife made me my favourite meal today and that genuinely put me in good mood for rest of day üòÑ quite simple but effective
I got through monster hunter 3 ultimate with my close friend and we're moving on to monster hunter 4 ultimate. Shit is tight.
Someone I‚Äôve grown very close to over the last month shared their feelings with me, and the feelings are absolutely mutual and it‚Äôs nice to have that confirmation.
My brother got to play with one of the neighbor's kids after a few months of isolation (they distanced themselves). Nice to watch him be happy.
I just spotted a chameleon in my backyard. For the first time in my life, saw it for real. Didn't try to pet it, just stood there observing her for hours. Beautiful creatures.
"I know I'm late, and will be in the pit of nowhere...
But. I was able to eat breakfast without any of the 7-10 possible problems I incur every time I eat."
When I leave my door cracked open my dog likes to patrol the house and open all doors. She comes in and checks on me to make sure I‚Äôm okay before going back out to the rest of the house
Applied for a job I really want after the markets been dead for months due to Covid so hopefully that‚Äôs a sign of good things to come And tried a new wine that was really good :)
My five year old daughter just came out of brain surgery to remove a tumor. Surgeon said it was a best case scenario.  Still need pathology, but step one complete toward her full recovery.
It's 10 days until my wedding. It's going to be small, and not what we originally wanted or planned, but I get to marry my best friend and I'm so excited to have him by my side forever :)
Came home from work and found that my kids both spent the day on creative projects:  son made a very impressive Sai weapon out of wood, and daughter crocheted a pair of slippers. Both blew me away with their skills and the results.
At first I really wanted to say nothing, but as I was about to press send I started to realize how much of an impactful negative events can have on your mood and, and realized that I actually have so much to be happy about, I got a 90 on an exam today and just realized that apple music is unapologetically promoting black artist, so I‚Äôm definitely happy about those.
Prolly may get lost in the sea of comments here but today was my first day back at the gym since my nearly fatal hospital visit October 2019. I became septic from an infection and nearly had organ failure. I used to go to the gym daily up until that point and I got a clean bill of health not too long ago. As soon as my gym reopened from covid I went in (today). I feel amazing. I missed being able to take care of myself and have that independence.
My mother was able to have her other knee replacement surgery and it went great. She is home and walking around feeling great. The fact she will be able to walk pain free or at least less pain and possibly ride a bike for the first time in 20yrs makes me happy.
my cats. they happen everyday but still. a little background, im clinically depressed and a freshman in college (now home cuz of covid) but when i was in the dorms i was extremely suicidal. like i tried to hang myself nearly everyday but things got in the way (bedsheets too stretchy, belt slipped thru the door, etc) so i wanted to bring one of my cats as an emotional support animal (i knew my cat was the only thing that could keep me alive at that point) which requires a letter from my psychiatrist, but due to a past incident, he could no longer write letters for ESA‚Äôs. my parents knew i was very depressed (they had no idea i was trying to die, but they knew shit was rough) so they brought my cat anyway. she truly saved my life. of course i was still suicidal but if she hadn‚Äôt been with me in my lonely single dorm i would NOT be here to type this. this cat seriously saved my life and i owe her everything for that.
"I had leftovers at work. Coconut curry chicken with rice and veggies my S/O made last night. 
Still bombdiggigity"
I am a student and my school year just ended. I might have to leave the school (my fault but not my accord) I learned a lot today. I mean, I sat down at my home desk and STUDIED for once in a while. I learned about the American Civil War.
I'm a few weeks out of a break up. I spent an hour long car ride singing along to disney music with my best friends today and I haven't felt this good in months.
I protested for the first time today and it went really well! We marched through the city and it was peaceful! My boyfriend and I also just our dream apartment after we were previously denied it and we can move in tomorrow!
Definitely late to the party but I got to bottle feed a baby sheep at the zoo I volunteer at!! Watching him get so excited for his bottle is one of the most heartwarming things to see
"Cool idea for a thread, my daughter did really well with her physical therapy today and it always makes my day chatting to her therapists for an hour or so.

Also got through most of the laundry pile woop woop #dadlife."
Took a really wonderful poo. A good poo always makes me feel great! I think it‚Äôs under-appreciated by many. Have always had bad stomach issues and it‚Äôs not all the time this happens. Don‚Äôt take it for granted!
Most days I would say something super simple, like the majority of these responses. But today I got a $14k raise. So, that.
Steve King (long time racist white supremacist POS) just lost his senate seat today, so happy he is no longer my representative.
Did a first official scheduled stream today on twitch and there was actually someone who watched and chatted to me. It made my day haha.
My boyfriend seriously asked me if chuckie finster‚Äôs (from the rugrats) parents were still together then he realized what he said. I almost cried from laughing.
My bf let me play a full session of dnd after a long time of not playing because of my ex bf wouldnt like how I was playing with other males. My bf also made food, made sure I had enough water. Even gave me a cup of my favorite tea, i tried so hard not to cry infront of everyone because I'm not used to being treated this way.
I‚Äôll be moving in temporarily with my girlfriend so I won‚Äôt be exposing my family who is at high risk for the pandemic while I return to work. She had offered for me to move in weeks ago but I was nervous about it. When I told her today I‚Äôd be willing to give it a shot her face lit up and told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited, I‚Äôve been rooting for this.‚Äù We‚Äôve had to be careful about spending time together obviously over the last several months and mostly had to resort to video chatting. It became very rough at times, but after seeing her face light up about the news of us being able to spend all our time together, it made made me so fucking happy. SO fucking happy. I can‚Äôt wait to finally spend all my time with the girl I‚Äôm in love with, again.
My 7 year old son and his sister are spending the night at their Grandma and Grandpas. He texted me before bed and said ‚ÄúWill you sing me a lullaby or read me a story?‚Äù So I sent him a video of me reading Goodnight Moon. He wrote me back about 10 min later and told me ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and that he loved me. My mom said he was asleep 5 min later. It‚Äôs a great feeling to feel needed even when he‚Äôs getting in some good Grandma and Grandpa time.
It was my birthday, I got int he car to drive to a Dr appt and 2 of my favorite songs came on the radio and all the lights were green!
Today was my birthday. First real adult one. I played video games and made some music. Felt a bit down but my dad surprised me with coffee during my lunch break (he lives almost an hour away) which was nice.
I'm 33 weeks pregnant and have been in quarantine due to covid for 13 weeks. Today I went for a -socially distant- swim in a friend's pool. The freedom, weight off my bump, seeing my friend, and getting away from my neighborhood for the first time in 13 weeks was bliss!
So a good start to my morning but basically I was playing animal crossing new horizons and kicks is at my island today and he was selling a Foldover-top backpack which is basically a backpack that has camo on and backpack was a different color! And the camo was the arctic camo or grey camo what you like to call it. So yeah now that I have the grey color I really hope there‚Äôs another color that has the camo of purple, teal and pink and I don‚Äôt think that exists but if it does I‚Äôll would be so happy
"I got my second gun (MP7) gold on modern warfare in 1/3 of the time it took me to get my MP5 gold and hit 155 for the first time!

I‚Äôm not a gamer so it‚Äôs the first game I‚Äôve actually sat and enjoyed playing even though I‚Äôm not very good at it! I‚Äôm also someone who just doesn‚Äôt complete things and just gives up half way through so it‚Äôs great having something not mind numbing to do whilst in quarantine and getting the guns gold is something to work for!"
Tried out my new roller blades :) only skates for like 20 mins because my back hurts very quickly, but it made me feel like I got good exercise at least ‚ò∫Ô∏è
My cat that‚Äôs been missing for 4 days came home. He was stuck under the neighbor‚Äôs couch (I have no idea ... her caretaker heard him crying today. I don‚Äôt know how the neighbor didn‚Äôt hear the last 3 days). He‚Äôs tired, dehydrated and hungry but he‚Äôs alive.
I got a job at the dog shelter I‚Äôve been volunteering at for months. Now I‚Äôm gonna get paid to do something I love, for the first time in my life. Also, happy cake day!
My dogs met me at the door to proudly show me they had discovered THEY can make the tennis ball bounce if they drop it while standing on their back legs, now they can play fetch with each other while we‚Äôre at work. It was cute enough it almost made up for the fact the ball had been part of the rope toy now laying in hundreds of colorful strings all through the house..
Reconnecting with old friends that I was afraid I annoyed or wasn‚Äôt good enough for. Turns out they had missed talking with me as well!
I walked into my garage and the light turned on automatically and I took a moment to relish how cool we have technology to do that.
"I'm on a crusade to like every comment in this entire fucking wholesome ass thread.

Edit 1: more curse words for *fucking* emphasis

Edit 2: I THINK I LIKED 1000 GOING FOR 2000

Edit 3: 2000 done but I don't think I can carry on. Someone carry on my dream please..."
(Not today, but a week ago) some kind redditor didn't give me gold, he bought me Terraria! What a great person
lately my girlfriend has been thinking about her future and she picked up Sculpting and it‚Äôs so awesome to see such beauty and passion in her. Makes me really happy :)
I blew my biggest bubblegum bubble yet and when it popped it got all over my nose but I was still pleased
It was my birthday. I was expecting it to be mundane day, but it turns out that my friends and family had all been in on the planning and gave me one of the nicest surprises my life. It showed me that I was loved and appreciated. It made me immeasurably happy.
I got a selected for a position that many others who outrank me were in the running for, really makes it feel like hard work pays off!
Did the Diamond Casino Heist twice today in GTA Online and made two million dollars. Surpassed sixty million in my bank. Nothing much but it was a nice bunch of cash for me
"I'm in a collab thing for TikTok, and every single day me and the 28 other people in the Discord server for it talk to each other. We make stupid inside jokes, and just be weird in general. But we also care about each other like family. I usually come to them when I'm feeling sad or unwanted, and we all cheer each other so much that we start to cry. I just feel super lucky to have them in my life.
Edit: I already forgot to mention that I've just vented to them a little bit ago (along with another person in the server) and we all constantly talked about how much we love each other and it just warms my heart."
Participated in a peaceful protest with my neighbors and it was incredible. We knelt for 9 minutes to honor George Floyd and my knee hurts but it was worth it because I still get to feel pain, and I can breathe. It makes me happy to have been on the right side of history today.
I decided to go back to school.. after almost 15 years. My professor graded one of my papers and told me that it was magnificent and that I‚Äôd be an amazing (job title). I‚Äôm not even planning on switching careers. I really just wanted to finally finish my degree. But now that he told me that, I feel extremely confident and know that if I ever do want to try something else, I can.
I helped a beautiful girl out at my store. I work at a AT&T retail shop and normally have been dealing with the crazies. In comes this girl who, not five years ago I would have never even attempted to talk nor look at, comes in and we have an above average interaction. Lately, I've changed some habits around and  was hoping for signs of improvement and I have to say that interaction definitely made my day go by a lot smoother especially with everything that's going on. STAY SAFE MY FRIENDS. AND IF BY SOME CHANCE YOU'RE READING THIS, I would love to continue our conversation at my store or elsewhere :)
I've just finished work. About to go for a walk. And after that I'll play with my son. Happy times for me
Spent time with family, people who I'm close to that lost a loved one yesterday and it made my heart full. During covid I have felt isolated and being able to do that tonight was very beneficial to my mental health.
I taught my friend how to play his new guitar. I started by showing him all the anatomy of it and then taught him come as you are and the first couple of bars of nothing else matters. Biggest smile I had on my face for weeks
Realizing that I lost 30lbs in the last 10 weeks, another 30 to go. But I never even thought that I will be able to do it and it wasn‚Äôt even that hard (but I‚Äôm a big guy).
I washed my minitruck, picked up some fresh chucks. And called out of work and convinced my homegirl to also and we went swimming in the river and had sandos
I cooked today for the second day in a row!  With everything that‚Äôs happening in the world and working on managing depression, this is a huge win!
Finally managed to get my weight below 100kg (about 220 lbs) for the first time in years! Really happy today, hope you all have a great day too!
My co-worker and I shared a genuine laugh because we have the same sense of humor and it's very, very stupid.
I came out to my sister, and was absolutely terrified. To my delight she accepted me for who I was. I've been riding the happiness since.
I‚Äôm currently in a residential home due to mental health reasons, I just got home though for the night and fuck I‚Äôve missed home so much
Someone found my cat 4 miles away from my house and returned it to me, been missing for nearly a month, thought she was gone forever.
There's a bumblebee that likes to bumble outside the window while my boyfriend and I are working from home - my boyfriend's named him Frank, and Frank graced us with his bumbles again today :)
My son has been depressed lately and we have been worried. Today , he was smiling and said he was feeling much better since we discussed it and we are getting him help. It was a good day. Teen years are difficult.
"I ran a 5k after 3 months of not running or working out!
It was absolutely hard but it felt ao nice afterward as if something gloomy has cleared up in my brain."
I received an email letting me know that the poster abstract I submitted for a conference in October was accepted. The conference will more than likely be virtual, but this will be my first time presenting on my research. I‚Äôm so excited!
The girl I like messaged me to compliment me on something I had written and presented for our course over zoom, we've been talking for the last few hours
my small, predominantly republican town held a peaceful protest today. never thought i‚Äôd see the day and it made me proud and happy.
Had a crappy day, but a phone call with my boyfriend (which i cried during) who is halfway across the world from me still made my day.
My bf‚Äôs cat sat down and let me pet her extensively with her eyes closed and purring (SHE CHOSE ME) and gave me a couple play bites and licks to keep going üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
"My friend (if they read this they will know its them) told me that they had a good day, he has struggled with some things and helped me when I struggled.

He saw both the sunset and sunrise.

He makes my life worth living.

His happiness matters more to me then anything else."
"I was closing at work and a customer walked in to pickup the last order (I work at a restaraunt)

We've been doing curbside for the past 2 months so this is like the first week since we opened up carryout and customers still aren't really interacting with us inside the store

Bro first came in set a $20 down and asked if he could use the restroom. When he came back he slowly started giving me his change in tips ..first the pennies.. then the dollars.. then the silver coins. Meanwhile he was talking to me and my coworker/bestfriend.

Dude was blasted but we don't really care.. at first he asks us when we close. It's around 9:20 sm and we close at 9:30, so we tell him this and he says ""oh, but wb that table?"" And he points out a table filled with a family of at least 8 who're gonna stay past closing time. We agree that we can't really leave until they do and that it sucks. Anywho we keep talking, he goes on to say sm about ""do y'all want this food on me?"" And I'm thrown off and I blurt out ""no, we're good, thanks you don't have to do that"" and he laughs and says he's jk. Then he says pretty much that he bet his friends that he could eat all of his food w/o the help of his friends bc his friends said he couldn't and he asked us what we thought. We're like yeah, nbd it's one pizza. He's like yeah but like it's a large whatever.. then prompts: what if I get really really high tho... bro actually
Why the fuck am I typing this shit out in a lil dicky paragraph when I dont really even give af umm end of story another dude walks in mid sentence of this guy he turns around *our friendly high guy* and looks at him and says ""alright imma go"" and leaves and that shit had me and my friend dying for a solid 20 mins after a shitty shift"
About 9 or 10 months ago a pregnant cat came up to my door and I took her in. She gave me 4 beautiful babies and today the last 2 finally got some interest! One has an official adoption date and the other is being seriously considered!!!!
I‚Äôve been having a really hard time lately and have been very discouraged with everything and I had expressed to my parents crying about a week ago that I wasn‚Äôt exited for anything coming up in my life, most prominently my sixteenth birthday. My family isn‚Äôt exactly poor- we‚Äôre very fortunate for the things we have but we don‚Äôt have a lot of money for anything extra. I‚Äôve been in bad need of a new computer for a long time since mine broke, and the MacBook I was looking at would take me forever to save up for with me unable to get a job for a bit. Today I was informed that my parents would be getting me the computer I wanted for my birthday, and that tomorrow we‚Äôd be going to get it. It‚Äôs not about the computer necessarily, but that my family made sacrifices for me so that I could have what I couldn‚Äôt achieve myself for a long time. That my family would go this far to give me an awesome birthday I initially thought was going to be terrible. What made me happy was that my family is truly supportive of me, not that it took an expensive laptop to show me that. Sorry for rambling. :)
I went on a six mile walk with my young nephew. Love that little guy and hearing all the things he wonders about.
Very bittersweet. But of the 12 people at my work 8 were fired due to Corona and 4 were kept including me. Massive relief for me but gutted that my colleagues lost their jobs.
Told everyone I was feeling lonely since I can't go out so we all spent the day messing around in Animal Crossing and Smash Ultimate. Real wholesome!
I went to a park with a friend, we broke had a mutual crush on each other. We sat underneath a pavilion and watched the thunderstorm, which we both love. He asked me out and we kissed and everything as super awesome. Stuff like that doesn't happen often to me.
 Caught up with all the sibs in one hour long chat session. Getting us all together at one time is a rarity.
"My cat came back walking after being thrown away about 2 km from here by a neighbour.

It took him a whole night. He ate and slept a lot afterwards."
"Our family has always had the life goal of owning a restaurant and running it together. Nothing is set in stone yet but it‚Äôs beginning to look like it‚Äôll become a real possibility.

We know the times we live in is going to make it tough but it‚Äôs a dream and we have to chase it. 

I have faith that we‚Äôll become a success and I couldn‚Äôt be more proud/happy of my family. I love them all"
Wasn't today, but I got a mic so I can practice my singing while playing guitar and it's helped keep me sane for the last few days
there was a stray cat on my back porch during my morning smoke this morning. i made it some food (some steak ums) and gave it water. it didn‚Äôt eat any in front of me, but when i walked away it ate almost all the food then ran off.
"After 8 years since running cross country in high school, I started running again in quarantine. I do about 5-8 miles 5 days a week now. Today I hit the gas and found that extra gear and it made me very happy. 

I graduated from college on March 20th so its been very tough. My mountain bike was stolen in April so I knew I had to find an outlet to stay sane."
"Your today was my yesterday ;)

Yesterday, my day was actually pretty awful. I've been feeling quite depressed lately, and I was supposed to have a zoom meeting with friends (when the world is normal, we have an activity all together on a tuesday night, so instead of the activity we do some games online while talking together), but I canceled last minute because i wasn't feeling well.

Because of the zoom meeting, my BF wasn't coming for dinner, so I could have my evening online with my friends and he would visit his mum as he does every tuesday.

When he went back home he texted me to know how my evening was and i told him i wasn't feeling well so i canceled my zoom call. Less than 20 minutes later he was there to give me a big hug (before you say anything, in my country, we have the right to see our partners during the quarantine even if we don't live together - we can see a quota of 4 people maximum each, so for me that means his mum, his sister and his niece. My parents live 2 hours away and we're still not allowed to go further than 100km from our home, so it made sense to chose his family as our authorised people)

Anyway, seeing him made me happy in an otherwise crappy day!"
I got complimented on the first cake I‚Äôve made from scratch since High School.  Red Velvet, Dark chocolate buttercream, chocolate ganache, I didn‚Äôt make the whoppers (decoration) but it was satisfying to make the rest & have people appreciate it.  ...it was also like 5 hours of work, and I‚Äôll be sticking to box cake, but it‚Äôs nice to know I can still succeed at it.
Created YouTube channel and uploaded video that got 1k views with in a day[listen to terminator - Arnold talk about George Floyd](https://youtu.be/JX16FKJCgjI)
I‚Äôve spend a day with a friend of a friend that I really like and he took me with him to meet his friends. His friends and I instantly clicked and exchanged contacts after playing scrabble at the lake. Later tonight I was asked for a kiss by a really cute and attractive girl. I still miss my girlfriend though. But that‚Äôs fine.
Fairly new to my job and I was assigned to a big project that I'll spearhead. I presented today and was told I exceeded their expectations! Glad I made a good first impression.
Woke up with my kitty laying next to me which rarely happens. Got a beer with my fianc√© at our neighborhood spot which we haven‚Äôt been able to do for months. Those two things made my day.
A guy I never met before suddenly decided to give me his bmw 1 series free of charge, then I suddenly woke up :(
"I spend the afternoon with my mother watchin' some of the old series she used to see when i was little, i still remember each of them, i liked the sparkle of joy that showed in her face when i asked it. 

Dr. House maraton, heck yeah"
I found out that my mom, who has had a very hostile relationship with God my entire life, found Him and got Saved. My heart is full!
I replaced my toilet tank after it was leaking,not usually good with tools but this one felt satisfying
I started running again today. I had a week of just hard depression and right after 3 weeks of focusing on getting my life back together. Today, I ran again and it made me feel really great about myself and my future.
I watched one of my chickens cozily lay down on her side in a sunbeam and take a nap and it was honestly so absolutely precious!
My nephews waited for me to arrive home from work before opening the new jigsaw puzzle we‚Äôre gonna work on!
As part of my recovery from mental health issues, I wrote a letter to my best friend who died when I was 10. I never got to grieve him properly, as I didn't know how at that age. It was very emotional to write that letter, totally worth it. I remembered so many things that we used to do, the games we played etc. Didn't think I had those memories and emotions still in me.
I saw the smallest (flying) bird I've ever seen! It was smaller than a hummingbird (I think, I only saw it closely with binoculars,) but it looked perfectly at home in the trees outside my dad's lake house. It was fucking gorgeous, had a large, blueish-gray, semi-geological pattern on its back that was outlined in black with a darker gray outside of that. It just kept flitting from branch to branch and eventually left, but I'm so grateful I got to see it while it was there. I'm sure it was just a young bird that just learned to fly, but I haven't looked it up yet because I want to keep the illusion of the tiny, beautiful bird alive.
I found an amazing nature photo i took a few years ago, which I thought I lost because my phone broke the same day
People seeing posts of protesters standing up against the people starting vandalism and violence- Black lives matter, if you only have to talk about the rioting and looting you don‚Äôt know the full story and you are willfully ignoring the murders and constant social injustice of the colored community.
Completed my first day of work in my new apartment and all of the sunlight coming through the windows was a joyous change of pace. This place just feels so much better and I'm so happy that I went for it, even though I wasn't able to tour the unit thanks to covid. 10/10
Dad made congee for breakfast per my request. The whole family eat together with dried pork our neighbors gave and a bunch of other sides. I wish everyday is like this forever! WFH due to covid situation really brought the family closer.
"I somehow got a mystery plant growing in one of my starter pots outside. I've been waiting and watching to see what it was going to turn out to be. It jumped from about 4in tall, to almost a foot long vines seemingly overnight.

And it's got the cutest little flower on it today!"
"I talked to my mom today and actually opened up to her. She's very opinionated about medical things even though she's not a medic, she's also an anti vaxxer, and tends to call people naive, ignorant or stupid so I'm not that keen on talking to her about a lot of things. Today, I told her about my decision to get birth control (something she's kind of against) and about my experience getting it which was not so great. I got an IUD and it really hurt to get it in. She told me ""I wish you'd tell me, I would have told you to take acetaminophen or something before going in. Medical workers can be animals, they should've given you medicine before the procedure."" I really have a lot of problems with my mom, but each time we have a conversation like this, it gives me hope."
Seeing people come together in the middle of a pandemic to fight for justice and equality. We need more peaceful protests and to stand up for what‚Äôs right. I truly think 2020 will be the year that everything changed for the better. Stay safe everyone. #BLM
I‚Äôm on week 4 of a tough fitness challenge. Before I started I could barely get through one of this girl‚Äôs 10 minute videos, and now I‚Äôm breezing through her 45 minute ones
I was able to flirt with a boy 2 months out of my ex breaking up with me. I really thought I was never going to be able to open my heart up to anyone again. In fact I remember feeling so disgusted at the thought of even thinking about someone else but here I am and I‚Äôm making progress towards finally moving on.
A co-worker told me that it was fun working together with me. Caught me off-guard and I nearly teared up over it...
"I was just not feeling too good, but then ""hail mary"" by 2pac came on on my playlist. its such a chill song, it never fails to make me feel better. that may not be as great as some other stories, but little things like that can just make your day."
"I was opening my restaurant up today and my top server walks in. This guy is a volunteer football coach at a middle school football team. I asked him how practice went yesterday and he mentioned, ""well I set a goal with one of the 6th graders. In the next few weeks we're going to complete a full push up!"" For some reason it made me smile. For him and the kid. Approximately 10 minutes later he got a text from his boss saying he's getting deployed in the morning. Now I'm sad again 

Forgive my grammar, it's been a long day"
My husband made a joke and said ‚Äúgot eem‚Äù. My 16 month old then turned and said ‚Äúgodeem‚Äù. She‚Äôs at the stage where she parrots most sounds. We couldn‚Äôt stop laughing.
I've been so focused  on following the news and my 3 y/o randomly came to bed, took my phone away and gave me the warmest, longest hug a dad could ask for... for a moment the world was perfect.
"I found a toad yesterday. I found him again today.

I like to think that maybe he came back to see me."
My daughter had an ENT appointment, and she‚Äôs going to have her tonsils & adenoids removed. Which I was expecting already. She really needs it because of her snoring & wheezing while sleeping BUT they told me she would have to be tested for covid 2 days prior. I cried off and on after finding out. See, I know it seems dumb but I‚Äôm not worried about the surgery. It‚Äôs an easy procedure & my daughter won‚Äôt be in any pain during because they are going to sedate her with laughing gas & then do the IVS so she‚Äôll literally feel nothing until she wakes up but to have the covid test really bothered me. She already doesn‚Äôt like doctors, dentist, anyone in the medical field because she associates them with pain. So me knowing how unpleasant the test is from videos & what other people have told me.. it just really bothers me because not only is she 5 years old having to get tested, but I‚Äôm going to have to watch my daughter be in such discomfort. I know it‚Äôs not going to be pretty. Her dad & I are not close, but we coparent really well. We stay out of each other‚Äôs lives unless it involves our daughter. I called him after I got the news, and I did cry on the phone & what made me happy was how much he does have my back. He‚Äôs going with me when she gets tested so she‚Äôll have both of us there and he kept reassuring me that OUR girl is tough & she‚Äôll be okay & he‚Äôll be right there with me & for me to stop crying & was saying things to comfort the mother of his daughter. It made me realize just how far we‚Äôve come & I‚Äôm proud of the team that we are.
My family and I spent the evening sitting in the garden by the fire pit with music playing. Felt nice to do something normal.
"Still have a month of chemo treatments left for our 2 year 4 month old but today was his hopefully last really intense chemo treatment day and hard week ahead because of it. 

He's been fighting Leukemia since he was 5 months and there's light at the end of his long battle with Cancer. Throughout his childhood so far going to the hospital on a weekly basis, taking lots of medications daily, having a chest line dangle from his body, having his chest line cleaned/dressing changed and having to tape and seran wrap his chest line for baths, he thinks that all of these things are what a child normally goes through.  

He watches kids play but can't really be around them nor play with them. But he has been a happy little guy that has been going through some good and really tough times. This is his normal. This is our normal and we're just thankful to have him and see him grow. 

What made me happy today is that today was a big step for our little hero, our little Superman, a step closer to having a more normal childhood. I'm not saying that we're totally out of the woods yet but he is doing very well and all we want for him like any parent for their child is to grow up as happy and healthy as can possibly be."
I was very productive and got a lot of work I wanted to get done in my hobby part of life done. I also asked out the girl I like and she said yes :)

Signed a contract to purchase my first house. Well, a unit not a house. But it's mine and it's exactly what I want.
It was my birthday, and my friends tricked me into a surprise socially distant party at the playground of my old elementary school. I hadn‚Äôt seen any of them in two months and it was the best birthday present I could have asked for.
I realized I‚Äôm getting better at guitar. I‚Äôve only been playing for 4 days but I‚Äôm already making noticeable progress.
My friend called me her best friend today. I know it may seem small, but someone who has moved around so much and hasn‚Äôt had a best friend since Jr high it really met a lot. I would consider her to be my best friend as well.
I was waiting a month for a dealership to fix my new truck I wok hard for. It was and it was driven home by myself and my wife. She said it was like home. Everything is worth the effort you put in to have something, even if it isn't all the time. Good day.
"I flexed my intellectual superiority on my ex.

Then she said ""damn you're smart""

I answered ""of course I am""

Made me happy to see her reaction of disapointement. She expected me to feel helpless, to hit depression, stuff like that because I was mentally fragile while with her. Now I'm back on my feet without any of her prediction happening and it makes me happy to remind her that she was, in fact, the problem."
My acoustic guitar finally arived! I won it from a giveaway and I normally wouldn't be able to buy a guitar for so long

My morning hadn't been great but that truly brightened my day. I'm still thinking about it and smiling!"
I was trying to take a nap and my cat was sleeping next to me. Out of the blue he starts purring and climbed up to my neck to cuddle <3
"Saw a video of a donkey that literally cried in happiness after being reunited with its owner after many months. It was heartbreaking but so beautiful to witness.

We need to be better to animals."
I finally got all of my parts delivered and for the first time, I built my very own pc! I‚Äôve been wanting one for ten years now(22Years old Now) and am finally financially stable to be able to afford everything and put it together all on my own! Very excited to see everything I can do with this guy
its almost finals time, and i am really sad that i'm not gonna see my friends as often as i did pre-covid after finishing, but i'm happy because i talked about this to them and they said that we'll go eat sushi sometimes. its gonna be something rare, but i'm sure i'm going to appreciate every moment with them as much as i did in school these years.
I watched a 24 episode anime, and I finished the whole thing today. I wasn‚Äôt very much productive since all I did was stay in bed, but I liked the idea of just lounging around.
"Met my girls parents. We brought her daughter and it felt like we were a family. We've been together about 7-8 months. 

    Her daughter made us say grace (she is... very special). Paw paw choked up and we had a great dinner. I'm thinking I might be a lucky man."
I'm an out of work substitute teacher and today I got to see the kids I've worked with the most for the first time in months on Zoom. I've really missed them. They don't know it yet but I'll be with them full time next year :)

My moody preteen daughter was in a good mood and actually seemed to want to interact with me! That‚Äôs so minor but it‚Äôs been a rough few months and I treasure these days now!
It's my last day of work, corona sadly took my opportunities here away. Three years come to an end. Ive sent a farewell mail to 51 colleagues and so far ive gotten a reply from 42 people. Got a gift from my favourite colleagues. Making my last day a little less sad.
"A random black dude gave me a free beer. Now, you might wonder why I mention his race, well...

 Yesterday I watched him get arrested out of no-where by 4 police officers in a very slick operation. Given the current goings-on in the US, I was obviously concerned about the back-story.

Today, he came up to me and said hello while I was waiting outside a shop. I asked if he's okay, and what happened. Basically he'd been temporarily banned from the beach for, and I'm reading between the lines here, being a bit of a drunken asshat to the public. He spent one night in jail for breaching that ban, and didn't seem to have any negative feelings about the matter. 

I was relieved that he was okay, and we started chatting about the usual life stuff and he gave me a beer. Made my day."
I saw a green anole lizard out in my balcony this morning. It was cool. It was inflating a red skin flap at its throat. First time I ever see one of those in person.
"I have been working at a grocery store for the last couple months, and today I was told by a higher up that several managers fight to have me work in their respective department. I was hired during the beginning of the pandemic and was made full time very quickly. Hopefully come review time I will be able to leverage either a raise or a promotion to something with slightly more responsibility.

I know it isn‚Äôt crazy awesome er anything but given the current state of the world I could be much less fortunate as I still have my home and my lover."
I was walking my friends dog on the beach when another dog walker came up with a border collie, the puppies played and I had a really lovely conversation with this stranger for the length of the beach. It made me feel so warm
My girlfriend that was raised in a republican household and had identified as republican most her life voted for the very first time - as a democrat.

I know it wasn't today but it made me happy"
I read this post‚Äôs threads and teared up a bit at how much joy I was hearing people have and to talk about it together. I really take things for granted it seems.
"I am obese
Today, after encouragment from my family, i have decided to lose weight. I started a diet and my entire family supports my decision. I really appreciate my family"

I realized that it's okay to get drunk even if it is in the middle of the week. I'm off work today, who's going to stop me?
I took a shower. might sound simple. I was going through a stretch of depression.. and usually that means I forget all self care. today I woke up and did a few adult things. then took a shower and put on clean cloths. Made me very happy.
Late to this party but I am happy today. Ordered something off an app for my SO's birthday yesterday and received the package today. :)
"I flew a plane by myself for the first time! I‚Äôve been waiting for this for a while but the weather and everything has been pushing me back.

I‚Äôm almost done with my license and can then move onto the next stage of training. Huge day!"
I read a few comments of people realising that those protesters are actualy terrorist, racist and that makes me happy, since they put all cops into one bag and called them bad... Not all cops are bad. They are just people like us  ut have a really stressful job.
I got accepted into one of the biggest polytechnic universities in my country. Cooked myself pancakes to celebrate
Happy to see this post that remind me to be grateful in life and It is always something out there for us to be happy about.

I just learned that my cousin (who just finished his studies) and worried about his future, was selected as the best of his class and he's going to be a professor.
I finally got the confidence to take my own pictures, I got severe anxiety and am very self-concious. To the point that I got a mental disorder and can‚Äôt bear looking at myself in a mirror or picture. Slowly gathering confidence every year, I finally got to take my own picture and see what I look like for the first time in 3 years~
Not seen my 2 boys since feb due to lockdown. They came down yesterday! so woke up this morning, on my birthday with my boys. Best birthday ever
I live in Kerala, a state in southern India. Schools have reopened online, with classes also being telecasted on a government-owned educational TV channel. I woke up and walked into the living room to find my 87 & 80 y.o grandparents happily watching the classes for first grade kids, a song on cats.
"I washed my truck and my future wife's car. The weather was perfect outside but muggy. Our AC was down so the house was hot as hell. Then at about 830pm I was sitting in the driveway scrubbing up some found golf balls, the AC repairman showed up and finished fixing our AC unit.  The house is 74 now instead of 84, and it made for a comfortable night's rest.

Tl;Dr AC repairman came through on a hot muggy day."
I got a charcoal bbq grill from a neighbor who bought a gas grill (that was the other day), but today a neighbor asked if she could buy my old bbq grill . I didn‚Äôt feel right selling it because a) don‚Äôt need $ that badly, b) she‚Äôs poor, c) other neighbor had given a much nicer more valuable grill to me for free. Anyway the nice thing was: she gave me a huge box of chocolates as thanks!
"My son (6)  repeatedly told me he had ‚Äúthe best day ever‚Äù. All I did was hang out with him after working from home. We swam for like 30 mins (in his .25m deep pool), cooked chicken on the grill that came out bad.. We ended up at Taco Bell, and rode our bikes around the block. 
It made me realize how important the little things are to kids."
"I get to eat my mother's nuggets & french fries today :D

My little girl has been scared to get on a swing her whole life. Today, out of the blue, she decided to get on one and she loves it. Quarantine has been tough and feeling very isolating lately and she had a look of relief and freedom on her face.
I woke up thinking it was Tuesday.  I logged into work and started working thinking it was Tuesday.  It wasn't until an hour in that I realized it was actually Wednesday.  Its like I time traveled into the future.
My parrot is afraid of me, and  everybody. Today was the first time I was able to hold him in my hand and pet him.
I‚Äôm disabled, I can‚Äôt walk and I‚Äôm mostly bedridden due to my condition. My 15 year old daughter gave me a pedicure. It hurt me to sit in a chair for the time it took but I felt very loved.
I woke up this morning feeling well rested for a change, and felt very peaceful while sitting outside with my coffee.
I went to the tile store and looked at tiles for a bathroom remodel. First outing (outside of groceries) in months. I also just love tiles.
My fianc√©e saw a whale and a crocodile in the sky in clouds on her walk and told me about it. I also just defrosted a home made lasagna from my mom
I've been super nervous about this new job, and my boss sent me an email saying good work on your first day, and I nearly cried
Woke up at 6 am. My sleep schedule has been screwed, but I drank last night and fell asleep early. One of the few good things I can say about whiskey.
My friend finally called me I was worried as Frick but he was alive and well. Yeah my friends really mean a lot to me.
My boyfriend of 5 months made a comment in passing about plans for xmas next year - it makes me SO happy to know hes thinking long term and making plans for so far in advance. I feel more secure and happy than I have in years
"I started a gratitude journal for the first time! 

I have read a variety of things about the mental health benefits of practicing gratitude - joining, I assume, OP which is why they posted this question - and I look forward to exploring the world with new, gratitude focused eyes."
My boyfriend came over! He never has before because of work but he made it happen today. It's so nice to feel a hug after so much social distancing. He's the only person I've seen irl (outside of work) in months.
I weighed myself for the first time in a month and I've lost 50 pounds! After eating disorders and depression since third grade, it feels amazing to be taking charge and improving my health.
I got a job. Been looking for 2 months now and was starting to panic a bit, but it all turned out well.
We got a 90/100 on a final report of a project which I was 100% sure we would fail because since the start up until the finish non of us really understood the project.
My fianc√© and I made egg/tuna salad sandwiches because we couldn‚Äôt chose between the two and I got to use the green onion I‚Äôve been growing recently in the  sandwiches. It was nice not to pay for green onions... even if they‚Äôre not that expensive anyway.
my boyfriend picked me up and immediately gave me his pen (a thing we do every time he picks me up) and I got high and we got burgers. we were at the freeway on the way to his house when this really cool song with a disco vibe came on from a playlist I just downloaded and it was such a bop and I looked over at my boyfriend and smiled, and I just felt so happy and contented and at peace in that moment.
"it's my birthday and a lot of people are sending me love. 

some of the messages really make me smile."
I thought I came into work with a reduced shift. 3 managers said the wanted me in their department as soon as the work was done in the others. I'm glad I'm wanted here.
I went golfing for the first time in 2 years! And had two decent drives. (2/18 yes I know but I hadn't golfed until adulthood).
saw my girlfriend after a week or so, went for vehicle inspection which went great and gave money to someone who needed it.
Today I went to a BLM peaceful protest in Long Island. It was so heartwarming to see so many people there, so passionate about this important issue.
Received a text from my parents this morning saying that they agreed with all the protest against police brutality. I was so taken aback because all throughout my life, they were terribly racist to minorities (despite the fact they were too). The text me so much hope.
"I just got to hire someone.  This person was flabberghasted they were chosen (they didn't think they had a shot).

Really cool call to inform them."
My boyfriend and I talked about getting married and having kids. It won‚Äôt happen for a while‚Äîwe‚Äôre going to have to go distance for a few months soon, and we both want to be more financially stable‚Äîbut I‚Äôm really happy. I love him a lot, and having a family has always been my dream.
"Thank you very much! I do
It every week and a half that the hummingbirds finish the nectar. BUT I stay away from bleach. And I urge yo to do so. this is highly toxic and can kill them, it‚Äôs very difficult to 100% rinse it. I was asking because I clean it and it takes me around 30 minutes or so and I thought I wasn‚Äôt aware of any natural tips. BUT NEVER USE BLEACH. It‚Äôs better to have mold than bleach rests.

If mold is super hard I sometimes had used vinegar and rinse like crazy. But what I do is brush it and use pipe cleaners."
"I posted a meme that said ""Swiggity Swirl, ya boi is now a gorl"" and it got quite a few likes and nice comments!"
I received a promotion and huge raise that I have been working towards for years!! one of the only good things to happen this year.
My daughter moved back home after leaving a bad relationship. It feels so amazing to know she is here and safe.
"Drove my motorbike to work today. On the way home through slow traffic, some car drivers (although very few) make a conscious effort to give me space to pass between the lanes. I appreciate it so much, restores my faith in humanity. I always thank them with a wave or a thumbs up, and I hope my gesture makes them feel good about it, and want to keep doing it.

When I think of it, traffic is so much like society. Elite bicycles hates everybody else, and yells it and shows it in body language every time they get the chance, it's like they like doing that more than actual cycling. Buses don't give a fuck about anyone else and just squeezes in everywhere they don't fit, even if they block everyone else for 3 light cycles. Cars mostly aren't paying attention and are just rolling in their own bubble, without knowing, caring, or trying to care what others might need from them to get through their day. Pedestrians here walk straight out in front of anything because they know they have the right to do it, and it's illegal to hit them, thinking everyone pays attention and every vehicle can stop on a dime. Taxi drivers think their work is more important than anyone else's and can break any rule, cut off anyone, and they always creep slowly across the red light blocking the pedestrian crossing, just to get a head start on the green. The only ones that actually help the community are the truckers, they know they will get to their destination faster with their payload intact if they drive smooth, create a good flow, let others merge smoothly, and pay attention to what others are doing.

You all know which one you are :)"
Yesterday I cried myself to sleep feeling completely overwhelmed with life. Today I surprised my coworkers at my old job with a visit after a year and a half of not seeing anyone and was totally overwhelmed by all the love I received.
I did a somewhat difficult haircut on a dog and the owners were very happy! They had shown me a picture of what they wanted, and they said it was perfect! I‚Äôm still in training, so it made my day. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I saw this post yesterday and didn't have anything to put on it but today I just found out I got the job I was hoping for. Even better news, my best friend was also up for a job there and they decided to hire us both!
"I went to Wal-Mart and on my way out I was stopped by some moral panickers trying to ban sex ed in schools.  I listened to the 30 second elevator pitch out of curiosity which was exactly what you would expect from someone trying to demonize sex ed.  I responded ""sounds good to me"" (acknowledging that the HEINOUS THINGS THEY ARE SHOWING KIDS BEFORE THEIR TIME was in fact good) and the look on the dude's face as I walked away was worth the wasted 45 seconds."
"Kitties always wake me up by trying to get as close to my face as possible.

But sadly this will be my last day with them, because I have to give them all away"
Not today but yesterday i had the last exam of my abitur (german version of A-levels) so i finally finished school

Restrictions were lifted for pubs, restaurants and bars to re-open this week, and finally I am able to sing! As soon as the restrictions were lifted I started getting messages for bookings and now I am almost booked up for June. Was so happy about this today that I cried. Music is a big part of my life, it is my therapy and has got me through depression and mental issues. It may not seem that big of a deal for other people but it was huge for me just having messages again from bars and restaurants wanting to book gigs again was massive!
Even after three months of lockdown had a happy, wholesome conversation with the love of my life and laughed on stupid things with all my heart.
"Someone that I haven't talked to in a while messaged me asking if I'm okay.

The reason? They want me to feel welcome.

I was and still am perfectly fine and made no sign that I wasn't"
Yeah, in the game, it‚Äôs on one of the stations hosted by Bootsy Collins. Station has some other good beats.
"I went out for a mountain bike ride and saw a snake. I didn't even know we had snakes in Long Island. 


Only part that sucks is I accidentally ran over it with my bike about a millisecond after I saw it. I hope it's okay..."
My husband finally got a referral to see mental health for his anxiety. He‚Äôs 31 years old had it since childhood and has been untreated the entire time ‚ò∫Ô∏è
i'm in an improvisation group in my school, but obviously because of the covid-19 everything related to school is stopped, but today we had a meeting and it was fun to see everyone :)
My boyfriend and i play punch buggy alot and I was loosing but then passing us on the passengers side 5 beetles passed us and I got him. Then we passed by a dealership that had 4 beetles,  got him another 4 times. Then we passed a junk yard with another 5. I never felt more lucky!
"My girlfriend and I argued, but it didn‚Äôt lead to us screaming at one another. It ended when I said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just put a pin in it and talk tomorrow.‚Äù

Ten minutes later she stopped me in the kitchen and gave me a kiss and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I love you.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a wonderful thing to date someone who cares, doesn‚Äôt yell, and apologizes even if it‚Äôs just getting heated."
A friend invited me to FaceTime with her friend group and eventually it was me, her, and another person. They said I wasn‚Äôt talking and needed to participate since I was officially in their group. I don‚Äôt think My other friends would have cared
I realized that now that I'm in my own home now (just moved put of parents place) that I can make large pots of food and don't have to worry about people eating the lunches for work I've prepared for myself :') This weekend I'm going to make a large batch of beef stew.

‚ÄúHello, it‚Äôs nearing the end of today. I watched the entire Avatar series in a day with Danny, it was fantastic! Tomorrow I‚Äôll skateboard, I‚Äôm regaining my skill.

(Danny is my twin brother btw)
This was the first time I‚Äôve felt happy in as long as I can remember, I finally fixed my life! I love my live, I‚Äôm thankful for everything. I can‚Äôt even believe I was sad about a week ago. Thank you world! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
I got admitted into a qualifying test which I was looking forward for a  longer period of time.Im very happyüåº‚ù§
i finished painting my clay sculpture!!! i made a mushroom for my cousins fairy garden i‚Äôm so fond of it :-)
I bought my girlfriend a tiny music box that plays the star wars theme as her birthday gift. i had it engraved. i hope she likes it.
Also I just beat King Dice (Cuphead). I went in with the normal peashooter, the homing shot and 2 extra lives. I decided to try to fight King Dice with the additional three from the bosses. I did so and when I got to King Dice, he sent cards from his left hand and I lost 1hp. He did then again, he went to send cards from his left hand while doing his stare and laugh, but no cards came out. Confused and still worried, I kept shooting him with the homing shot. I'm listening to music but trying to focus, but during the glitch I got so into the music. It was all done when I got an achievement for something I didn't earn. I was so ready to fight King Dice too. The only reason I brought in extra lives was because for almost every miniboss and King Dice, you need to parry and I suck at parrying.    Anyways, this was the story of how I encountered a glitch up close in person.
Waking up and watching the amazing world of gumball and just remembering the memories I have of the show
"Oh man, was an amazing day! I told people how other minorities matter too but when I got down voted for saying that, I simply changed my narrative to ‚Äúonly black lives matter, not other minorities who are just as oppressed‚Äù and got 200 awards, 20 Reddit platinum and the mods themselves congratulated me.  

Then, I defended the looters in the streets and agreed with them burning down buildings that belonged to other minorities. Several Redditors offered me their first born for being such a great person as a result. 

Finally, I posted a black square on Instagram and INFLUENCED the hell out of people. 

Now I‚Äôm #woke as fuck and the extremely intelligent people of Reddit accept me as one of their own."
A small stray cat let me pet her, she is very clearly blind in the same eye my late cat was! She's pretty thin and I left out some food and water for her, I'm hoping to help the poor thing..
"I finished building my Gaming PC!! 

Been saving for it since before Christmas as a student. Took ling but finially got everything (almost).

Just need to save for a replacement graphics card now :P https://imgur.com/cSv4xMr.jpg"

"Not today but 2 days ago. 

I got released from the hospital after 11 days and that morning I was feeling much better. 

My nurse that day was a very sweet young lady who I later found out had only been a nurse for about 4 years. 

From my bed I could almost see the patients room across the hall. Suddenly, there was a huge argument that I couldn't see but could hear. The old lady in that room was yelling at a nurse...MY NURSE!

Anyway, as luck would have it, she washed her hands and came directly into my room. I was thinking ""Oh.no, here we go."" However, to her great credit, she was ultra polite and professional. If I had not seen the argument, her demeanor would not have indicated anything was wrong.

She got close to me and I lightly touched her hand and said ""don't worry, she's been mean to everyone since she got here. I'm sure she's just scared.""

This opened up the floodgates and we started to cry and hug and talk for about 30 minutes. Afterwards, she thanked me profusely for making her feel better. 

I was grateful to the doctors and staff who had gotten me well enough that I could be there emotionally for this young nurse.

TL:DR: I was finally well enough that I could be there for someone who was having a bad day through no fault of her own and I felt good about it"
I looked at some old family photos, like old as in black and white (not only black and white) and it was very cool to see them.
"My crazy mom finally died today! I'm so happy! She destroyed my life from the day I was born. I can finally live life now that she's gone. I'm soooooooo happy.

Thank you God! Thank you for taking that monster out of my life. Today is the best day of my life. I'm free at 46 years old!

Thank you. The wicked witch is dead!!!!!"
I've started living alone in February, been working at a restaurant for 7 years, then corona shut it down. Never learned how to cook, so my mom came over one day, brought supermarket stuff including rice and other food, but you had to cook them. She just said good luck and left. I was surprised at how something simple as cooking your own food could make me so happy. And i make sure to cook something (and sometimes failing horribly) everyday.
I hung out with my oldies but goodies friends, and their kids and mine...the next generation of us and I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful ‚ù§Ô∏è
Got the ok to move from 48 hr shifts to 12 hr shifts (due to COVID). 12 hr shifts are rough but compared to 48 hr shifts they feel so much easier now.
I read that when a dog puts their paw on your hand when you‚Äôre petting them, it‚Äôs because they love you. When i talked to my dog about my problems when i was sad earlier today (he‚Äôs a good listener) he put his paw on my hand and i instantly got happier
"The vanilla cake I was baking came put with no cracks for the first time.

EDIT: nvm my sister said it was dry :("
"That a dog (Bernese) walkes up to me scared because his owner yelled ans abused him, i patted him for like 5 minutes and told the owner im taking his dog, he said its his dog and should atleast pay etc. but i yelled back in a middle of the park ""YOU ARE ABUSING HIM AND I DONT CARE IF ANYONE FROM YOUR FAMILY LIKE'S IT OR NOT, IM TAKING IT TO ME"" that big fluffy ball is sleeping next to me on my bed right now
 I feel so good about what i did, the dog sure takes my aura so good and is happy all the time, *honor medal*"
I had two chem finals today one I studied for one, but didn‚Äôt have time for the other. I was ready to do the exam stressed af, ready to completely guess the 2nd exam, then believe it or not the part I studied started and I finished it. Then they cancelled the 2nd exam(the one I didn‚Äôt study for at all) for some students due to technical problems, never felt this lucky before. I don‚Äôt know if the cancelled it or rescheduled it but I‚Äôm happy nonetheless.
I'm happy everyday and have been friendly since birth. I get aggravated sometimes at what other people do, but I never get angry. Mad and angry make you age faster.
Been working out with a overweight friend of mine for a few weeks. Today called and told me ‚ÄúI can actually use my neck again for the first time in years and I don‚Äôt get back_cramps at work anymore‚Äù
"Cleared both (2 wheeler & 4 wheeler) driving test today!!üòé
both tests coincidentally fell on the same day, so I was sure will fail both."
Technically it happened yesterday, but I celebrated my birthday (and a close friends' birthday) by getting ice cream with him and two other friends. We maintained physical distancing as much as we possibly could, but were as socially close as we could ever have been.
Today I spent the afternoon with 2 friends  haven't seen in a very long time. Not only that, but i also told them about a thing that's been hurting me for a while now, but haven't told anyone before. It felt really therapeutic.
My boyfriend just paused his video game to lean over and kiss me for no reason- it made my heart sing :)
My English teacher told me that my English is as if I were from the U.S. (English is my 3rd language)
"I know it might sound like a really small thing to some but today I learned how to not only install a door knob but also use a round file to edit the shape of a hole in wood. 

My daughter and I moved in with my elderly grandmother about three years ago after fleeing my mate of 10 years for chronic abuse. I used to do heating and cooling 5 days a week with my dad, I used to think nothing of building, fixing, or assembling things. Yet the door knob to my grandmother's bathroom has remained broken since I moved in. Ten years of cruel conditioning trains your brain in terrible ways.
 It really just hadn't occurred to me until about a week and a half ago that I am perfectly capable of installing a new door knob. I actually went for a lever since it would be easier on my grandmother's hands and when I went to install it the hole was too small by a few millimeters. I went into my long-dead grandfather's toolbox and found a round file on a handle. Long story short I enlarged the hole, I figured out how to put it together and we now have a perfectly working bathroom door lever! 

So like I said installing a doorknob may seem like a small thing but today for me it was like finding a triple rainbow outside with Deadpool riding a goth unicorn down one to take me out on a date!"
*why are these posts still allowed, we all know they‚Äôre just used to farm for karma and are against the rules so why are these reposts never taken down*
I met my baby today for the first time. It‚Äôs still early - only 5weeks and 6days but the ultrasound showed them and their little heart beat. I‚Äôve been struggling to get pregnant for awhile, have experienced a previous miscarriage, and have had some bleeding with this pregnancy so seeing a glimpse of them today was such a relief. I‚Äôm hoping they hold on and we can meet in person in January.
Kpop fans are using right wing hashtags to flood the conservative portions of the Internet with fancams in an effort to reduce pro-police sentiment
We got a kitten 10 months ago and my older cat has hated her to the point we alternate which one can be out at a time. They each have a separate sleeping area. Well today my older cat decided she didn‚Äôt want to be in her room today and refused to stay in so we just let them interact to see how it went. They did so well! It was the first time they‚Äôve interacted in a way that wasn‚Äôt borderline fighting and they were both calm. No aggressive stances or puffy tails. They just sat and looked at each other. It only took 10 months!! For one good day!
Nearly finished a cool-looking storage room in Minecraft. Brand-new design I was testing out, and it looks really good.
I adopted two stray kittens... It's been a more than a month now and from couple of days both of them were in heat.. so I thought I would let them go out for a walk... Both went out... And didn't return.. I thought I lost them.. but one came back.. and the other is roaming around the building with other cats
To see that our police are doing such a good job protecting cities across the nation from utter destruction. They are working 12-hour shifts and my hat goes off to all of them for not cracking under all the pressure.
Just got a hook up on some personal protection since I can't count on the police to protect anything in the city of Chicago anymore, including my life.
Despite literally all the craziness in this world. It is nice to see people finally standing up to their governments.
At the NYC BLM protest today everyone (thousands) wore masks. It was awesome to see that especially while the right wing snow flakes were posting their memes about hoping we all die from Covid-19.
I started watching The Midnight Gospel today! I was delightfully surprised when I realized it was like a podcast that you can watch. It was so good I finished it in 3 hours!
A friend of mine passed away a week ago. There was a rainbow outside my window today. It made my day.
I saw a girl posting some horrible racist things on Facebook so I informed her employer. She‚Äôs been fired. Fuck her.
"Today I probably watched one of my favourite anime movies so far. It's called   ""Kimi no Suizou wo Tabetai"" or ""I want to eat your pancreas"" in english. Great movie, a little bit sad though. Would recommend to anyone."
My girlfriend smiled to me over the video chat in the morning and told me to have a great day at work :)
I was listening to some asmr while playing a game I like, nothing extraordinary, but I‚Äôm pretty content
I managed to keep my dead end job this morning by locating the missing 250$ of lottery tickets. Had I not found them I would have been terminated for theft despite the knowledge of it not being my fault. Someone had tried to run put without paying for the keno tickets yesterday on my register. I need this job for a while longer. Wife is pregnant and maternity is coming fast and the pandemic has halted my job search for now. I didn't need that panic attack.
I was given $1000 in aid from my school through the CARES Act. It basically helped college students effected by coronavirus since many aren‚Äôt entitled to the $1200 stimulus check.
A friend of mine came over with her daughter and brought me a lox bagel for breakfast. We played with her daughter, whom is 2 years old, and talked about the peaceful protests going on in nearby Oak Ridge today. I love playing with her and being silly in the midst of all the craziness in the world because it's all so innocent.  We all could use a reason to smile and remember everything we do is hopefully going to lead to a better world for the next generation.
Saw a video of a young girl battling apolecia try on her first wig. Her reaction was the purest joy you can find.
When I went to wake up my 6 year old this morning she said that she loved me and reached out to me before she even tried to open her eyes.
Reading quite a few of the posts on this thread were pretty uplifting, tbh. Thanks OP and fellow Redditters!
Watching the protests in the news, yes, made me upset,  but also made me happy about how a bunch of civilians are coming together to try and put an end to the race war. They know that they're equal, and they want the government to see it too.
I managed to figure out a difficult proof from Pinter‚Äôs A Book Of Abstract Algebra. It was such a satisfying feeling to understand why such a simple fact is true.
My 7 month old son put his pacifier back in his mouth the correct way. It was the first time he ever did it.
Set my empty coffee cup on the kitchen counter to go to the bathroom. Came back out to a full cup of fresh coffee made by my amazing hubby. Totally made my day!
Had a problem with a variable in my Django project, it was called autor instead of author, after struggling for a while day, the only thing left was to laugh and be happy about it
"I found my rock and fossil collection!

Landlord needs us out by January, so we've been purging and packing.  After years of neglect, I finally dug deep enough into my disaster site of a garage and found the boxes of rocks, minerals, and fossils I collected while in college.  Haven't seen this stuff in over a decade!"
The song my friend and I have been working on for a while finally got uploaded to Spotify! It's a tiny victory but it makes me very happy even if I'm not able to share it on social media atm
My sister's elementary school had a drive by parade today and my sister's current teacher stopped her car to give her (my sister) candy and tell her how much she misses her.
I got a couple backlogged projects put to bed for the most part.  Reduced my weekly workload a bit.  Feels like it never stops.
As a hockey fan, seeing the news about Oskar Lindblom finishing his cancer treatment was awesome. Fuck cancer.
All the restaurants and businesses on my street were destroyed and boarded up. This morning a hot dog cart was out on the corner and I had a chili cheese dog for breakfast. Best meal I‚Äôve had in a while.
i planted some spring onion shoots yesterday, just to see if anything would happen, and today one of them has begun to sprout.
"Chatted with my crush a bit

Also I was chill in general so my job was much more tolerable than usual"
"Happy cake! 
It's hard to find happiness today. I saw a video of a guy reuniting with his pet donkey, i bought ice cream and not much more. ):"
I ate way too much for dinner, after an otherwise good day. I went for a walk, did some work on my thesis (which I have been struggling to motivate myself to do). I am overweight and have always struggled with food, you see.
I mailed a post break up letter to my ex girlfriend today. I got out of my system what I needed to say: I deserve better.
I get to go home for lunch everyday because I live super close to work. Today I made myself some burritos and a delicious strawberry mango smoothie. So that was my highlight of the day lol.
My friend made art that she's proud of today.  She's been having a rough go at things, and I'm glad she found something that brings her peace and pride.
I am filming a Horror short atm and had this idea of an Invisibel Cut for a Time jump. I didnt knew if it would work but i am looking at the Footage rn and it looks really good :D
Woke up in a good mood. Went to the skate park in Hope's of getting some clips. Started raining on my way here (walked to the park) I'm still here by the way. Only just now I'm waiting for it to dry up because it stopped raining about 20 minutes. Ugh
Because I'm working from home I was able to take my dog out at lunch time in the (rare) British sun. He was over the moon with it and it made me think how much more I can give him and everyone else when I don't have to travel to work.
Got to talk to my dad. I live in Chicago and haven‚Äôt had a chance to speak to anyone I love and tell them how close I was to the riot damages. He always helps to calm me down, and it was good to admit how I feel better about things but that I‚Äôm still worried/scared.
I saw people uploading pictures of them voting in for Bernie Sanders and I felt really uplifted and positive.
"I went for my daily 3-mile run since starting two weeks ago and for the first time, when I started to get exhausted and checked how far I'd gone, I'd already gone 3.9 miles. 

Every other day before this, when I checked, I'd have gone maybe 2.5 miles. Today I got the first proof positive in a very long time that I'm getting healthier, faster, and stronger."
I woke up and saw one dog snuggled up against me and the other one on the floor. When I got out of bed the other one jumped up for a hug and kissed me! Took that one for a dryland mushing workout through the neighborhood before I had to go to work.
We got help with the bills today. We still need to come up with rent but it is definitely weight off our shoulders
I registered for my dental school classes. I've been trying to get into dental school for maybe 3-4 years now, and it's great to finally make it in. I'm NOT looking forward to the actual school part, but if I can survive, I'll be golden.
I had a bad day at work and I mentioned it to my gf and she told me she was gonna go to the store and then she would call me back, well turns out she actually drove an hour to come surprise me at my house. She was waiting there for me when I got home from work. She lives about an hour and 10 mins away from me. She drove that way to surprise me. I love that girl
Very little.  Best I could do was not be pissed off. I'm at the beginning of my anger management journey, which I am not looking forward to, but looking forward to the results.
I left a snack for some ants in my garden today and I saw a beautiful rainbow with my girlfriend a little while later. I also hugged a tree. Life is great :D
I work in a plaza, and there's a canal nearby that attracts a lot of birds. I saw a mama duck leading her babies onto the asphalt towards the busier part of the parking lot, so myself and a few employees from other businesses ran out and redirected them back to safety. Teamwork.
I went to a local bakery to pick up a doughnut after a walk. I got complimented on a tattoo I got in January and it made me feel great :)
"I was living in the city for the past few years and haven‚Äôt been able to garden. recently moved back in with the folks because
I lost my job due to COVID and didn‚Äôt want to renew a lease. I spent 2 hours gardening this morning-  it was the best I‚Äôve felt over the past few months"
Me and my sisters got to spend a day with my Mother who we hadn't seen in months. Mother's day (22 March here in UK) was especially harsh, but we knew the best choice would be to stay at our homes for all of our health and video call her. There's just something special about finally seeing her in real life today.
I received recognition from my supervisor during an all-staff meeting in which the director of the museum for which I work was present. It made me feel great to know my hard work and contributions are recognized and appreciated.
"My son caught a fish!  He casted the pole and everything too!

Just me and him.  Nothing else mattered.   It was bluegill but I was something special."
Finished writing the script for my very first podcast. I‚Äôm gonna wait a while to share it because of the current situation but I‚Äôm one step closer!
It rained,  and the house is cooler, the water is a crisp cool temperature after weeks of being lukewarm. Everything smells like the first rain and happiness <3
"*""You have absolutely no idea how much I wish I could kiss you right now""*

Text this morning from woman I started speaking to from OKCupid a few weeks ago. We were supposed to have our first date last night, but her mother was hospitalized Sunday with respiratory problems and confirmed yesterday as covid. So now she's self-isolating since she had contact with her mother the day before that."
I edited about 40 pages of my upcoming novel, and it made me laugh and become surprised, like my heart skipped a beat because I really liked what I had written. Good signs. Also I cuddled a rabbit.
"I sat with my mom and watched her balance a checkbook.

Sounds a tad odd, but I've learned to love the little moments I have with her."
Took a Air Force veteran to a bank because his ATM card did not work. It took over an hour because all the walk in counters are closed nearby so we had to drive to the next town over.  From stranger to someone who could tell a good story that made me laugh out loud! [He joined the Air Force to be a pilot just after WWII but ended up an engineer because his right eye did not have 20/20 vision.
"It was yesterday, but it's carried over....

I lost 17 pounds and I didn't even try to... Seems my commute was a major factor in my fast food and over eating."
"Just watched a video post on r/interestingasfuck of a space walk on the ISS with Earth in the background.

Very beautiful."
Watching my little boy kiss the phone screen to his mamma who is poorly in hospital. No prompting, he just wants his mamma to know how much he loves her

I booked the appointment to go wedding cake tasting. We just got engaged Friday and this is the first thing that makes it feel really real
I went on walk near the man-made lake and saw some really big fish in there. That was cool. There were also a bunch of fluffy ducklings and gosling out and about.
I was sitting outside in the sun with my dog in my lap. Then my dog fell asleep with her head under my chin. It always makes me so happy when she does that.
"I was finally able to cook em big fluffy pancakes after many failed attempts!!

I couldn‚Äôt keep the excitement and joy for myself so i sent a few pics to my friends and actually proceeded to post something on reddit again!"
"I found out that a girl I know, whose last boyfriend ghosted her because of her depression, got a new boyfriend and she seems very happy with this guy.
Haven‚Äôt seen her smile in a long time."
the founder of my company called my store to tell us how proud of us he was, and how important all of us are. my whole team started shrieking and happy dancing, it has been the happiest i‚Äôve been in months. i just love my job and my people so much and it was a huge surprise!
I had a good night's sleep, my new mechanical keyboard arrived in the mail, and Mum made this amazing carbonara spaghetti.
"I saw a baby girl being carried horizontally (like a sack of potatoes) by her father.
It was adorable as she clearly gave zero fux. That made me happy today."
"I accidentally pulled the cord on my pc headphones hard enough to damage the connection, so they would only work if you hold the cord in a certain spot. I‚Äôm sure we have all had this happen. 
These headphones are not cheap so I thought I‚Äôd try to fix them. They were broken anyway so why not try?
I went and bought a soldering iron and some little bits and pieces for like $30 opened the headphones up and and replaced the broken cord and connection. 
IT WORKED! Not only did I save myself a couple hundred dollars, I learned some new skills too. 
Made my whole week!"
I was playing animal crossing and my peach trees now have fruit! I‚Äôve been trying to get peaches for so long and now that some lovely individuals got me some now have my own supply!
I woke up to find that the stores in my neighborhood weren't looted and vandalized last night... unlike the previous night.
My cat was laying down on a pillow, and the way she was laying made it look like she was hugging the pillow
Woke up and decided I wanted to get another tattoo and piercing. It's nothing big haha but I just feel like it helps me relax knowing I'm getting permanent  ink on my body üòÜ . And I've always wanted another piercing  since I only have one on each ear so I'm excited. Kinda want a nose piercing... don't know when I'm gonna do it but I'm excited.
"Well today we got a call about my boyfriend‚Äôs job. He will be going back to work tomorrow. (Been out of work for two months) for more money per hour. Meaning we will be able to get back on our feet again! This virus hit us hard. We thought we‚Äôd have to move out (live together) and head to another state in at least two months since our rent just keeps getting higher and higher. We are just two 18&19 year olds. 
Im graduating from high-school this Friday and that was weighing on us having to leave my family and move due to financial troubles. 
That news just made me very happy and hopeful since the world is in shambles. We are gonna be okay."
I got to swim in a pool for the first time in 3 months! Gyms in my area are now starting to open, with precautions. It was exhilarating hopping in that cool water..!
Today is kinda dragging.  Nothing bad has happened.  Still cant find a Gamecube controller or memory card, but if that's the worst of it I'll be good.
I woke up and started working on updates for the first game I ever released. I kind of stopped and felt really proud of myself that I could make people happy if for a brief moment.
I figured out how to color label rows in pheatmap using a specific feature and it was a total ‚Äúfuck yeah!‚Äù punch the air moment.
I had to sneeze for like an hour then finally did. It was like having a full body orgasm and I scared the shit out of my dog.
"I visited one of my favorite bookstores and bought 4 books. >!Potiki (Patricia Grace), Junky (William S. Burroughs), The Plague (Albert Camus) and the Masnavi (Rumi). !<

I live in the neighborhood and the walk there is so pleasant.

The weather was so beautiful and I felt very happy. Decided to ignore my mind-numbingly boring chores so I could read instead. So that's what I did all afternoon, enveloped in the golden sunlight and completely lost in the world of my books. Happiness personified. :)"
I've had a crush on this girl for 4 years and today I asked her if I could call her.she said yes and I called her and told her that I've liked her for a long time. She hung up and I was devastated. A few minutes later she called back and scheduled a date in a week's time. I'm ecstatic right now
"A few things made me happy today. The first is that my kitchen is clean. The second is that I had a job interview this morning (The first in almost 2 months) and I was able to schedule a follow up interview for Friday. 

What happened that made you happy today, OP?"
Did some self care today and now I smell good, am lying in bed watching Clone Wars, and have plans to see the guy I‚Äôm seeing for the first time in three months tonight.
Having my 3 year old willingly snuggle with me as we watched a Coyote Peterson video and I fell asleep.
Watched a livestream on r/TheYouShow of this girl knitting and she was so excited to be on the front page. It was adorable and really made my day
"I had a dream which showed me what I should change about my life. I did 30 clean push-ups (my old highscore was 25). I gave my mom a hug (we usually do not do this). I spent time with a great friend. And I finally did the homework I ""forgot"" to do. 

Thank you for the nice question!"
"Even though I started back working in a restaurant, we are taking precautions, wiping things down, social distancing, and doing everything we can. Also, because of our now 25% capacity and the fact that most customers eat on the deck anyways, I got to see a couple old regulars I haven‚Äôt in a while and loved it. 
I‚Äôm still absolutely terrified but seeing them kicking and taking precautions themselves, really made my day."
My day started with a hug from my 21-month-old daughter when I opened her bedroom door. She ran up to me with her blankie and tossed her arms around my neck and said ‚Äúdaddy.‚Äù I choke back tears every time she does that.
I ordered some dimsum for lunch, havent had a proper meal in a couple of days due to the curfew restricting me. T‚Äôwas delish
I watched some youtube videos that made me laugh out loud for most of the time, haven't laughed that much in forever :)
Went to the driving range with my wife. She is just learning the game and last time here was frustrating for her. She has made some adjustments and today she was striping it!
I went round to visit my aunt. We hung out in the back garden and I played with her two dogs. I miss my dog after I had to put her down in january (inoperable tumour). It was great just to cuddle with them, since we can't hug family yet.
Woke up on the beach with my best friend after our vacay got canceled last year because I got into a life threatening car accident. Couldn't be more thankful.
"Ok so I‚Äôm playing one of those mobile games where you build a castle and fight other players right? Well, my alliance, (the group I play the game with) follows the ten lvl rule, meaning I can‚Äôt attack anyone ten levels below or above me.

Recently there‚Äôs been a low lvl alliance harassing one of our newer players. They had also been sending hateful messages to him and me, Since they were low lvl I had to let my friend deal with it himself.

Until today.

Our alliance leader finally gave the kill order, allowing me to shred them all like wet paper. Today was a good day."
One of my best friends told me that her elbow is the best it has been in a year (Some idiot crashed into her when she was sking) and there is a possibility that it might be fully recovered in 6 months.
"I got given an additional 4 hours on my contract.

I know most people would hate this but was only on 27 hours for a job I absolutely love, deliveries, as I love driving and basically get to do what I love for a living and occasionally speak to people and give them food. 

Also I‚Äôm at the point now I‚Äôm exceptionally bored when at home with nothing to do (I don‚Äôt really game much) and count down till my next shift cause at least it gets me out doing something interesting.

Made my day getting a phone call asking if I wanted an extra 4 hours.

Not only 4 extra hours tho, 4 hours added to my Sunday shift....so cause of Sunday premium is really 4 hours work but 5 hours extra pay.

Right now I'm just drawing, listening to ""Show Yourself"" from frozen 2 while wearing comfy clothes and I just finished a MONSTROSITY of a milkshake/root beer float hybrid and I'm just cheerful. Some days I'm happy as can be and others I just want to lie on the couch all day. It's nearly 90* F here so I can't really do much outside, though it IS *really* pretty out there.
Also I did a little tidying up in our basement and found my dad's old high school year book and seeing his track team photis reminded me how much I like running."
My mother had a successful hysterectomy, so now she doesn't have to worry about another ovarian cyst or other complications concerning those organs.

Finally saw one of my coworkers, who had been WFH because he is extremely high risk. He told me an awesome story about finally being able to hug his granddaughters this past Sunday.
I got agreement from two teachers that they would write recommendation letters for me. Both teachers taught classes I somewhat struggled in and I wasn't sure if they'd agree due to online workload/writing other letters but the fact that both of them could was nice.
I cooked spaghetti with my sister and it was hella good, but I think the time spent with her was what made me happy the most today.

My husband cooked a tasty breakfast for us this morning as I got ready for work. He‚Äôs pretty awesome.
"Sat out in nature and had a talk with an artist friend of mine. He said he wanted to evoke a certain feeling that takes people away to a different place, and hoped he'd manage to create something like that one day. I replied and said he's most likely already achieved that with friends. 

I think I may have made him realize the importance of what his paintings mean to friends/people he's given one away to. Told him the fact that people are proud of hanging his art on the wall, that they/we talk warmly about them to others when he's not around, he had never thought of it like that before.

It was a pretty cool bro-moment, and I hope he fully takes it to heart."

I finally have a car! I‚Äôm 20 and have been struggling to find a vehicle and get around since I began college three years ago. I can‚Äôt wait to be able to find other places of work and be independent. I know it‚Äôs a lot of responsibility and payments, but it‚Äôs so worth it.
Sitting on the couch eating snacks with my son. I recently went back to work and have been working a lot. For some reason emergency veterinary hospitals are hopping in my area. So relaxing on the couch with my son is what I needed.

Simple pleasures."
I finally got a spare set of keys for my car after 3 years of having it. It's a big relief because I accidentally locked myself out.

Also i got a big tractor tire so i can get ripped this summer."
My girlfriend texted me. We became official over the weekend. Nothing special, she just told me about how she burnt a spatula and set off the fire alarm, but it's just nice to talk to her.
For the last 6 days, every hour of the day, I have been filming a woodpecker feeder i made out of a log and a 3d printed core filled with peanut-butter, and tonight (just now) one came along and investigated for 20 secs and poked his beak in a few times!

"I found this bat flopping around in my yard with a messed-up wing. I couldn't live with myself if I didn't try to help. I let my husband know that I was going to get the bat to a vet, and his immediate response was, ""Do you need help?""

I am sad that the bat was hurt (and it looked pretty serious---it may not be possible to return it to the wild), but the way my husband jumped to my aid, told work he had to take a break, and went with me to drop off the bat...well, I married the right person. (He also told me he's glad I'm smart enough to not grab the bat with my bare hands, haha.)"

Creative Assembly announced that Total War: Troy, a game I was really looking forward to, is sold for 1 year of exclusivity to Epic Games Store, however it also becomes free to claim and keep for a 24 hour period on release day. I'm interested in very few games this year but this was one of those that I would have had to give up so I can afford others I'm more interested in, so this is definitely a weight off my shoulders!
My husband. Every single day he does so many things that make me happy.

I was driving around in Detroit MI today to get out of the house for a while. I love about 15-20 minutes away, so the drive is pretty easy. Anyways my friend and I were driving around and pulled over to pee behind the gas station dumpster and saw an older black guy cleaning the parking lot of this gas station near the dumpster. We just said our hellos and went on about our day, but ended up having to come back to pee again. The guy was still there cleaning, pulling weeds from the cracks in the cement this time. I offered him cigarettes and gave him 6 Newport‚Äôs. It made my day by spreading a little kindness in such an evil time.
I just got off the phone with my pops as he just finished his first round of chemo.  He‚Äôs 76 and got every known side effect from it but made it through.  Feel horrible that I didn‚Äôt check in on him enough.  Today I am grateful.
My cat had to get some shots today and was an absolute champ (he is very skittish around people that aren't my husband or me, and we couldn't be in there with him because of Covid). Now he's walking around like he owns the joint. Makes me smile.

I made it to the gate of my flight. I‚Äôve never flown before without an assistant/my brother, I‚Äôve always had one or the other, but today it was alone. I have a connected flight and everything was weird even though I‚Äôve done this over a dozen times before, but I made it and I‚Äôm proud

I bought my first pair of skis! Looking forward to finally skipping the line for rentals... if/when we can hit the slopes again.

I am currently learning how to ride a motorcycle to get my driving license. This morning during the lesson, we stopped in a little street waiting for a garbage truck to move.

Then it took all of 5 seconds to find the other side of what was supposed to be a very simple button going back and forth between the two rooms. The button in the main room was fully functional the whole time- we just never looked directly at it.

Good times are being made."

I finally, after 3-4 weeks, was able to plant my seedlings for pumpkins, sunflowers, watermelons and tomatos into the ground and made a cute garden area in my back yard. Quarantine has severely peaked my gardening interest.
Showed off a new personal 3D printer at my office. Most of them never saw one in person. I‚Äôve had at least 2 at any given time sine late 2014
My favorite music group released a new album today and that made me extremely happy to hear them listen to new music.
Received a album that I order a month ago, even tho it came late it was worth the wait, the album is just so good, been bumping all day
I get to see my girlfriend.. we get to see each other once every few months. Our schedules don't match up and she works/school full time. She workd triples on weekends, while I work mon-friday. We also live 30 minutes apart and have to drive through some of the worst traffic in my city.
Started a new job remotely . Realized the amount of pressure to preform at an exaggerated pace from my old job. This job is so much slower and gentler and better. I feel like I can not even comprehend it but also love it
"I am having a good hairday. 

I haven't bothered with makeup or appearances really since lockdown started. But, I have started tsking better care of my hair since I had time to go throuvh the ""ew"" period of transitioning from daily shampoo and showers to every 3 days and co-washing a lot. My curly hair is healthier but no one has really seen it. Now my job has transitioned to full time remote permanently, and we use headphones, so i never wear my hair fancy even for video calls since my mic would flatten it.

Today our puppy training class starts after being delayed, so I put on makeup and used my hair gel and my hair is now super curly and looks good. I will be pulling it up to put a mask on, so it will only look like this for a few hours, but it was nice to have that normalcy."
I went back to my office and saw a few select colleagues. It was so nice working on a desk with a proper chair and a screen and a keyboard etc.... we will be doing 2 days a week at the office and 3 days home office. I‚Äôm happy because my cat appreciates me more when I go for the day! Lol
"The locks on our house got changed.

We've been living with a hell-beast of a roommate for two years. She finally moved out on Saturday, the lease with her ended Sunday, and she kept at least one copy of the key (either because she's a bitch or because she forgot, we're not sure). Changing the locks was the last thing on our list so we're finally free of her."
Dropping off program wrap-goodies (a letter and shirts) to marginalized youth that I work with. It's been weird running programs virtually, and I hope it brings a smile to their face or lets them know that, even at a distance, we care about them.
Woke up feeling awesome. Tomorrow marks 6 months of living on my own, completely independently. Thus proving my whole family incorrect. üòÅ
Our satalite TV bill was about to go up from ¬£57 per month to ¬£83 per month, rang them up and got it down to ¬£48 per month with no loss of channels. Pretty small, but nice to get sorted.
im talking to someone that i havent been able to talk to in two months. i wasnt able to get in contact with them and they are finally replying to me again
"Finally got enough candy to evolve my Meltan in Pok√©mon Go!    

Now if you‚Äôd asked yesterday, I‚Äôd have said, the peaceful protest I went to downtown in my city stayed peaceful the entire time and the media still covered it to prove that protests can still happen without erupting into violence!!"
So i bought a very nice game, been to a walk with my dog, hugged my mom, slept to the 10, saw my dad and i have been helpful to my mom. I've had easy lessons and thats all. Oh and best wishes for everyone Reading this. (sorry for my English im from Poland)
Weather was good so I went out and watched the sunset. Nothing feels more relieving than watching the beautiful nature!
Well not today but 2 days ago but I finally found some of my friends that I haven't talked in 3 or 4 years! It was amazing talking again, so many old memories.
A friend who I haven't spoken to in a while reached out, we had a very pleasant and goofy conversation
The eggs in the robin‚Äôs nest on my back porch hatched. Now when I need a quick moment away from the screen of my work computer, I look outside and watch the two adult robins alternating feeding the four baby birds.
"It's my 21st birthday today. 


My favorite tv series director (Pretty little liars, I. Marlene King) sent me a dm on twitter wishing me a happy birthday."
It's my birthday and my boyfriend came over for the first time since quarentine started. Having a good day.
"Finally noticed that my dog doesn‚Äôt bark so much at the door when people are in the hallway and he can ignore all bikes on a good day. 

Training everyday finally paying off?"
My 4 month old laughing while I gave him kisses. He just started laughing recently and it makes my heart so full to hear his giggles. His smiles are also just as intoxicating.
I've always been interested in becoming a pilot (mostly as a hobby, not as a career). Today I begin online flight school!
We're nearing completion of refurbishing an old storage shed in our yard into a workshop for me (sewing, painting, sculpting mostly) today specifically, I went out and bought a rug to cover the plywood flooring. It's one of the last pieces I need before I can start moving in shelves and my desk. I'm extremely excited to have my own work space after 20 years.
all my plants started flowering!! started as seeds when lockdown started and now they‚Äôre beautiful little buds of joy
"I got to see my girlfriend again and it made me so happy, I miss her so much

Edit: also happy cake day se√±or"
My wife and I got a new rescue cat for our apartment and today was the first day he felt confidant enough to come out for pets. :-)
Today I answered my first call on Be My Eyes, and it was truly a incredible experience! I helped a gentleman identify a $10 bill, and then we got to chatting! I highly suggest you download the app if you can!
I asked a girl out for dinner on Thursday and she said yes. Since I still want to observe social distancing, my plan is to do curb-side pick up and do a picnic-style meal at the (closed) courthouse parking lot next door to the diner. I've got a folding table, folding chairs (with seat cushions), a table cloth, candles, napkins, a portable speaker, and such. I will bring along a bucket of ice and bottled water to drink. I don't know if anyone has done a cheeseburger by candlelight meal in a courthouse parking lot before... There is a first time for everything.
Not today, but tomorrow is my dads birthday, and on Friday is my boyfriend's. You can say I'm pretty excited and happy!
"During a sunny evening dog walk, I passed a young couple with their very curious baby girl in a stroller, said hello, smiled and waved to her and got a big smile and wave back. 

Went a little further and turned around to go back home, now walking towards them, and passed them once more. 

On the road, I then see a stuffed animal. Pick it up, ran back to them and asked if they‚Äôd dropped something. 

It was the ‚Äúgoodnight/sleepy time‚Äù animal of highest importance. 

That was a nice feeling."
Future MIL has been stuck in the Phillipines since February. Tried multiple times to get her home (to the US) only to have the flight cancel last minute. She was supposed to fly in tomorrow, but flight was cancelled sunday. We were able to find a flight on Sunday that left in just a few hours, and a family member reserved her a ticket fast. She's now safely home as of late last night! We're so thrilled.
I just had training with my team for the first time in months (My coach‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúIf we can riot, I‚Äôm pretty sure we can have training‚Äù).
I've was feeling for these cheesy jalape√±o chips from Burger King for a while, so today I just said fuck it, and ordered 2 of the them.
I am getting something that I have wanted for a very long time and it‚Äôs getting delivered next Thursday. Taking two days off to enjoy my new hot tub.
"In Poland the court forbode one person to say that certain legal organization consists of  fundamentalists sponsored by Russia. I helped to spread the forbidden sentence on the internet and part of it finally appears as a google suggestion. The senstence is: ""Ordo Iuris to op≈Çacani przez Kreml fundamentali≈õci"". Now when you put Ordu Iuris into the search bar you get ""Kreml"" as a first suggestion.
The organization itself consists of well educated lawyers who inflitrate public offices and push forward extreme agenda trying to ban abortion, sex education and legalizing domestic abuse.
So, yay, we did it."
I'm happy I got a new client today, and I recently moved apartments and my new washing machine arrived :).
I have my first sports practice tommorrow since this entire quarantine I was so excited I was basically crying cuz I miss my team so much lol
My future manager verified that I still had a job. Was very close to having my offer rescinded, but they told me they thought I would be a great addition to the team and couldn‚Äôt let me go. Feels good man :‚Äô)
Today I was dropping my friend off at the airport, and was quite scared about what the current state of my city would be.  What made me happy was we cleaned up very fast and it looked like there was minimal damage.  Honestly the feeling of happiness and relief after every block looked fine really made me happy.
"Omg I got a good one! 

I was given an interview at my local Carpenters Union!

Thursday morning. I'm so excited!"
My husband took me on a picnic to the park we got married at, to celebrate our 2 year anniversary. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I went golfing with a good buddy of mine, for the first time in months. Only thing was a little warm day but nothing beats laughs, beer and a good burger !
I got to see my baby on a screen and was told he or she was very healthy. I also got to see them do a little dance which made me laugh
My girlfriend and I had a picnic lunch in the park near our apartment. It's a beautiful day and we've been stuck inside due to a shelter-in-place order, so it was nice to get out and enjoy the pleasant weather.
I baked brown butter toffee cookies and they came out good. so now I have like 30 cookies to shove my face with.
A friend posted an old video of me performing music at an event. I don't get to perform as often as I'd like anymore, so the memory was good.
My brother inlaw is staying with us for a couple of weeks just so he can get away (parents are fairly toxic and he has been quarentined with them from the beginning ). I was asked to teach him to cook since he is 18 and doesn't know how to cook pretty much anything.  Yesterday I gave him a crash course in a few things and had him cook a chicken breast sandwich for himself.  Today he was still talking about his sandwich and was so proud of himself.  He also helped my fiance grill burgers last night .
Got a two new characters in a mobile game I like playing, one with a 0.25% drop rate, and the other one was one I'd been wanting since they came out.
"I'm camping with my best friend today, this trip with her has been pretty spontanious and it's great.
We went to an animal park and fed some deers, petting the goats was fun. 

Now we're watching a stupid love drama and eating ice cream which is great."
"Told a very racist person what's what on Facebook and opened their eyes to systematic oppression, right down the line to real meaning of ""crunk"". Hilarity ensued."
Im working in an apartment building today and a cat was roaming the hallway and was asking for pets. Made my day considering how stupid the day already was
I invested money into GNUS stock a few days ago.right now I'm up 56% on my investment. 43 of the 56% of that is just from today. So I'm happy.
I woke up walked 2 dogs, worked from the girl's home while she slept. Picked up some breakfast before she woke, we ate, then had the sex.
"My air conditioner got fixed! It's been pretty hot outside recently, so that's a relief.

Edit: Never mind, it's still broken."
I was sun tanning, when a squirrel came and sat under the bench my feet were on! It was adorable! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been that close to a squirrel! He was just chilling there for a few minutes!
Me, my partner and my cat just moved and so it‚Äôs a new surrounding and new furniture but, after 4 days the days the cats finally wanted it jump up on the sofa and snuggle with us instead of sleep under the bed or explore!
Had a video call with friends today since we haven't had a good chat since before Corona hit. It made me feel pretty happy. It's good to talk with someone.
"I told a good friend who I grew very close with the past few months all the things I liked about his personality because he quote ""doesn't like himself"". It's not much, but maybe I brightend up his evening just a little bit."
I went to the gym all by myself. I mustered up the motivation and went. I got a good workout in too. In the past, I‚Äôve always felt unsure of myself and insecure at the gym. But today, I walked with confidence. I‚Äôm so proud of myself.
The store director for my part-time retail job asked if I wanted to come and buy clothes on sale for 75% off so they can make room for new inventory when the store reopens in a few weeks. It was just me alone in the store while she worked in the back office and I felt like a kid in a candy store. It was nice to shop without worrying about proximity to others, lines, etc.
I got my dog microchipped so now I don‚Äôt have to ever worry about her getting lost. (I‚Äôve had her five years and it‚Äôs never come close to happening, but it‚Äôs still a huge relief.)
The dog park is finally open again so I can take my mini Aussie to go run her heart out. She‚Äôs been a trooper through this whole pandemic and we have felt so bad for her.
"Just passed my drivers test. It had been a long time coming too, I meant to take it back in December. I only just finally had all the documents in order. My dad took me out for a milkshake after.

Also Valorant's out in full access, yay"
I make super experiment bass music and my mom is super Mexican So I was very surprised and happy Cause today my mom was listening to my music and I checked on her phone it was on her favorites playlist ü•∞
I had a 2 day downer on poker but managed to get back to winning today. Did a 7km run. New motorbike parts arrived.
"Actually asked a girl for her number that I‚Äôve liked for a long time and got it so yay. 

Worse time to be starting any sort of relationship though so that‚Äôs dead in the water but for the moment I‚Äôm just happy and I‚Äôll figure out what to do...er later haha"
"I lost my job due to covid, but I finally got government unemployment assistance checks in the mail after fighting with the system for weeks! I was sweating for a hot minute about lack of funds.

I also made savory miso oatmeal for the first time, it was glorious. I hope everyone out here finds a little positivity today, big or small.

Edit: typo"
There's been a fledgling robin and parents hopping around my backyard today. It's been so nice to look out my window and see this tiny bird learning how to do bird things.
I realised that even if everything doesn‚Äôt go right in my future or life I will probably be fine. Feels like such a weight lifted off my shoulders.
"The look on my friend‚Äôs face as I slapped her dad. 
For context, it was a joking kinda ‚Äògotcha!‚Äô slap, no force behind it and it was all taken in good humour, and delivered after he gave one to her earlier in the day. 
First time meeting the guy, I‚Äôd like to think I left a lasting impression."
"I told a fake ""lower your credit card interest rates"" caller that he should shove a bunch of credit cards up his ass."
I didn‚Äôt have to have surgery. I was scheduled for this morning, but when I went in the doctor told me my medication is working well enough that I wouldn‚Äôt need surgery anymore.
"This morning, I laid in bed awake until my ""morning routine"" started. My dog, came running into the bedroom excited and full speed. Jumped onto the bed and threw herself against me and just stayed there. She received pets for a good 1.5 hours. It just felt like one of those mornings and it was so relaxing. She fell asleep at some point and woke up just as I got out of bed to fill her bowl and take her outside."
I worked out, ate salmon, and played video games. About as average as it can get so at least I‚Äôm not unhappy
i‚Äôve been arguing with my close cousin back and forth for the past few days regarding the blm movement. she agreed with the protesting but overlooking the real issue because of the property damage. i woke up with a text of her saying i was right.

My grandad has been unwell (nothing serious but he is 95) and he is says he is feeling better today and back to normal. It‚Äôs the little things sometimes
I got my leaky faucets fixed for free by a nice plumber who lives in my neighborhood.  He even brought dog treats for my puppy.
I run D&D for 2nd and 3rd graders for online summer camp. I have a camper who is really shy and had a hard time opening up. While we were building characters she needed her parents to motivate her to make decisions. Today was the first day that we actually played and she completely fell in love with the game. She was participating and laughing the whole time. At the end of the session when everyone was logging off she said that she had a lot of fun and couldn't wait to play again tomorrow. Her saying that really made my day.
This is small, but I was sad a few days ago when my partner could only take off one day later this month when I thought he was taking off the entire week for us to spend some quality time together. Randomly today he pulled me on his lap and told me that he told work he‚Äôs taking off a week in August and we can go vacation together. Will have to be a socially distant, quiet vacation, but aren‚Äôt those the best kind anyway?!
"My friends changed their custom statut on discord to ""PRIDE MONTH!"" And I havent told anyone but 2 of them I am trans but one of my friends I have told it to made another friends that dosent know that I am trans change to the same and it wqs really nice that they did that even tho one of them might not understand it <3 and I hope everyone else had a nice day and remeber to drink water and stay hydrated!"
I got to start my guitar lessons again after my teacher was in the hospital for several months. He's doing great and I'm happy to be playing again.
When out walking today, I saw an owner lifting his bulldog with a little cone around his neck over a fountain so he could drink water through the cone like a bowl. Idk it was cute and made me happy :3
"Drove home to Houston from Oklahoma and did it in record time - 6h45m from Tulsa city limits to Houston city limits. Didn't even speed that much - just 4-5mph over. It's also much cheaper since I sold my Hummer for a Toyota Avalon. Drove by the gas station where I usually filled up and I still had half a tank, AND it costs half as much to fill up. I checked, and I got 420 miles (Tulsa to Huntsville) from one tank.

That extra time equated to an extra hour of sleep for me before work, so yay!"
I was finally able to buy all of the parts to my brother's graduation present: a brand new mid-tier gaming PC. Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM, 1TB storage, all the works. He'll no longer have to worry about struggling with an old 32-bit machine, and I can keep my skills sharp as a tack. Plus, by tomorrow I can buy the upgrade parts to my own PC, which will feel so good, not having to worry about which part will break next.
Me and my friend made a website, got it accepted for adsense, and made ¬£12.22 in 2 days with an article on the PS5 release :)
Actually waking up with a message on my phone from my gf saying hurray to me and a picture of today's newspaper saying that it was my name day today. I don't keep track of that, but it was just a fun fact for me about this day. In Norway, it is Rune/Runa/Runar nameday. And I got up, starter my day a biiiit more lighter than usual. Those small things, ty gf.
My online exam went better than I expected and I think I did just fine. Lot of stress off my back :))
I‚Äôve been really trying to get my life together this year despite everything going on in the world and I‚Äôve been doing pretty well. Today I got the last of my marks back for school and will officially be graduating high school later this month... 15 years after I dropped out. Definitely feel that a major failure of mine has been corrected and am proud of myself for it.
My boyfriend and best friend (twins) said that they can come with me to the Six Flags Safari at the end of the month! (They live almost 2 hours away from me)
I protested peacefully, and my entire community seemed like it was supportive of the BLM movement. It was incredible, and we stood in solidarity and heard the voices of some amazing and diverse speakers.
I got to go to school today to do work and got to see one of my friends and some of my favourite teachers and talk to people outside of my house for the first time in ~3 months
"I came across this post. 

Today we had a funeral for a beloved grandmother, it's been a tough day. But this thread has made me happy."
I painted my nails, might not seem like much but I work constantly and am very depressed rn, so doing this little thing for myself uplifted my spirits.
"I've been sick for a solid month. It started like a flu, then turned respiratory. A round of two different anibiotics and steroids helped me feel better after two weeks of feeling like death, but just when I was breathing better I started to get severe joint pain and swelling. It was excruciating pain just to walk to the bathroom and I couldn't straighten my arm for about a week.

Today I woke up and it didn't hurt to walk or make a fist, I can straighten my arm. Today I took the dog on a proper walk for the first time in a month. My birthday is tomorrow and today I feel like I'll actually enjoy it."
I saw a baby skunk today and I watched it play in the grass for like five minutes! Seeing it so happy made me happy
Today I fixed my dads broken Pc motherboard from 15 yrs back (I‚Äôm 10 btw(pls don‚Äôt report me to mods))
"I feel good that I broke up with a guy last night.  And I went fishing today.  And caught nothing.

But that is all OK.  Because I did what I needed to do to be happy today.  It is freaking gorgeous out today!!  Finally!!!!!"
"One of my favorite restaurants opened for the first time in months today. When I called in to give my order the owner immediately realized who I was and called me by name.

Little drop of normalcy."
I have had some rough work days, and a coworker offered to cover today if I took her Saturday. It lines up since I have tomorrow off, too. So Im taking the time ot get housework done and just mentally unwind.
Some guy was playing fetch with his dog in a field inside a park. I was a good distance away going on a walk. The guy happened to throw the ball in my general direction but nowhere near me and the dog went to me instead of the ball. The guy was apologizing profusely but I told them that was not necessary because I love dogs and that made my day. I was chosen! I feel honored to get puppy love.
"The gal who embezzled from my parents company was sentenced today. 30 days in jail! 

She stole about $100,000 from my parents property management company. We all trusted her. She worked for them for 6 years."
"First of all: Happy Cake Day ‚ò∫Ô∏èü•≥

Today my mum got me the mandolin that I‚Äôve wanted for a while because I hadn‚Äôt been doing well recently (I don‚Äôt have a really good relationship with her either, so the fact she did this made it even better) ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"There is a hedgehog in my garden who keeps coming out in the midday sun looking for food.
I think the general advice is that hedgehogs who do this are in danger of death. It is not good.
Today was the third of the weekly sightings.
Long story short, I chased him slowly round my garden and he ate the large spoon full of dog food that I gave him."
"My cat sat on my bed, she generally is scared to go in my room, but today she jumped on my bed and now were just vibing together!

Edit: grammar mistake in the first 5 seconds"
"Girlfriend went home to the countryside yesterday morning to visit her parents. Her father had to see his doctor for glaucoma today so gf drove him and her mother back here where his doctor is. While he was there the ladies came to our place. Her mother is 70 and has been cocooned like us

. When she got in the door she gave me the BIGGEST hug.

Being accepted by your family is a fantastic feeling, but being loved like that by your SO's family is a very different and special feeling."
"May this be the stupidest one here: fucked a milf and i am now on the way back home :/ 
Edit: spelling cuz drunk"
Saying hi to my sister through the window, and my youngest nephew (10 months old) stood up on his own for the first time. He was so happy!
A Battalion Chief in charge of logistics for my department got his ass chewed by a higher level Chief.  The logistics Chief is a bean counting ass clown who made our lives difficult over the smallest inconsequential details.  He was making our day miserable with his combination of incompetence and indifference and got put in his place.  It made my day suddenly go smooooooth and easy.
I manage a food place that has very messy bagels. The station used for said bagels was an absolute disaster and I was sure I was going to get stuck cleaning it up at the end of my 10 hour day, as it usually happens (we‚Äôre always very busy and that‚Äôs low on the priority list.) I left the area for some time to get other work done, came back and a delivery driver (who‚Äôs job is far from cleaning the bagel area) had the whole area spotless without being asked or anything in between orders which isn‚Äôt a lot of time. I know he did it just to help me out and that made me happy.
"There was a big rain shower today. My kid found a big area of mud next to the window where I'm working and squished all around in it, barefooted. She kept calling me over to check out her ""new shoes"". Kids and mud are a pretty delightful combo."
I listened to the Beatles while working and had the windows open all day. The weather has been gorgeous and it was nice to feel a little bit of normalcy.
My dog made it to his 5th birthday. He had a seizure a few weeks ago and didn‚Äôt think he would make it!
went swimming with a couple of friends after school. Cold but a nice way to start the summer months :)
"I'm a college student that relies on my mom's money because having a job while in college isn't normalized unless you're really poor or super rich. Since I'm middle class, I'm not allowed to get a job (my mom is against it) so what I do to earn money apart from saving allowance is writing essays and other paperwork for my fellow college students.

Because of quarantine I get 0 allowance from my mom because I have no school a.k.a no reason to spend. But what made me happy today is that 5 commissions came in and though I didn't price it very high (because everyone is struggling financially due to this pandemic), I'm still glad I was able to put something in my bank account :)"
I wope up at 8 or 9, from a beutiful dream, then whent back to sleep, woke up from a weird dream, went back to sleep again and basically I had like 5 separate dreams, all like interactive VR movies. Then my cat got me put of bed to feed her. But man I love sleeping and dreaming. Things are just so much lovelier than reality!
I got noticed by one of my favorite YouTubers, ElyBeatMaker. I mean, it was a couple of words and he didn't complement me or anything, but it meant something!
I and a friend went to a store to buy beer. On the way out some random guy stole a 1.5l bottle Wodka belvedere (105‚Ç¨). After a 30 minute chase by foot and car we finally got him and the police arrested them.
It was 26 degrees Celsius in Sweden today, which is pretty damn hot. I went to a lake with a friend and just relaxed all day and swam around in the water a bit too, easily top 3 best day this year.
i‚Äôm 16 and made my first ever scrambled eggs, i told my sister about it and she said ‚Äúgood job, i‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù it meant a lot to me even for something as small as eggs
My intern thanked me for encouraging her for starting a career in science. She said it meant a lot to her and gave her clarity on what she wants to do professionally in life. The is the first time that I'm mentoring someone and it felt nice that I touched their life.
"I'm trying to do the couch to 5k program but am struggling hardcore. I still haven't completed day one but I did four of the eight jogs and walked the rest. 

That probably means nothing to most people - but I'm happy and proud!"
I'm making chili for the first time, so that's sort of exciting I guess. I've been working in professional kitchens for about a decade now and there are so many typical american foods I've never made because I usually worked with ethnic foods. I miss pork belly and crab gravy and char kway teow, but I don't miss the grind AT ALL.
I found an adorable Peter Rabbit toy chest for my son whose 1st birthday is next week. It was $3.75 at Goodwill.
I've been recovering from poison ivy and today has been the best I've felt all week. Very little itching or puss!
"During quarantine, rumors about a civil code change appeared in my country. They were to ban gay marriage, make conversion therapy legal, force transgender people to plead in court to be able to transition, and take away a child‚Äôs right to a home when their parents got divorced. I was terrified for weeks. 

Today, our governor confirmed it‚Äôs actually the opposite! Everybody can get married, conversion therapy is illegal, divorce doesn‚Äôt require going to court and trans people can even change their gender on their birth certificate! :D"
Formula 1 announced an 8 race schedule starting next month. Then I read the rest of the daily news...
I turned 25 today and I‚Äôve been coming to terms with the fact that, as a black man, a large percent of us don‚Äôt end up as fortunate.
Seeing the BLM protest on my way home. I wish I could have participated but couldn‚Äôt. I honked and yelled as I passed.
A good friend reached out to me. I thought I had no more friends and my life hasn't been that great the last six months so it meant even more to me!
I went to a protest in Fredericksburg expecting to get tear gassed and shot at with rubber bullets (after two days of this happening to protestors). Lo and behold the police actually marched with us and opened a dialogue with us. It was an amazing sight to see.
I woke up motivated enough to clean my room and also clean out my car! Some iced coffee and Skyrim in between loads of laundry is also a bonus!
I had a positive and productive therapy session, made even better by the fact that I initially wasn't feeling it but by the end was glad I followed through.
"My kindergarten students graduated today. It's bittersweet because I won't be at the same school next school year so today was the last time I'll see them but it was so awesome seeing their smiling faces and their tiny grad caps on their heads.
Side note: it was a drive through ceremony, the kids stayed in their cars."
My friends completed an objective I set. I started training on that one week ago and one by one my friends joined. Unfortunately today I had backpain so i was stuck at home but they did it. And I'm happy for them
Watched a YouTube video that briefly mentioned the Hadestown soundtrack. Listening to that now and diggin it.
I came out to my brother today. Literally everyone else in my family is nice but homophobic (and I mean everyone) so I was worried he might be too but all he said was ‚Äúok‚Äù so idk if he still thinks being gay is a sin but either way he still loves me and I trust him to not tell anyone else
I got my stimulus check and paid up all my bills.   Have money left over to fill my freezer and pantry with groceries.
"Happy cake day!

A fellow user of the Reddit app ""Boost for Reddit"", has figured out a bit of a work around in order to get GIFs from *Redgifs* to work better without going to external browser."
I went for a walk and bought soft ice. I ate it in perfect sunny summer weather and could not stop smiling.
"Today was a milestone in my family. My oldest son is now a high school graduate.  We have been through a lot in the past 3 years, a separation from my husband and then his unexpected death last summer. There were moments when I wasn‚Äôt to sure he would make it.  He pulled it off and I am so proud of him. 
He wants to be a airplane mechanic.  I‚Äôm having him take a gap year. I‚Äôm hoping he matures in this time to the point that he is hungry for this dream he‚Äôs had for a long  time."
I had a sandwich with my grandma's cat earlier. She ate most of the ham but it was still fun how she would press her paw against me asking for more
I was given funding for my master‚Äôs degree by the university I‚Äôm attending! I‚Äôm going to be a TA, which I‚Äôve always wanted to try!!
My cat hopped up on my lap while working, and hung out with me for a while. It's nothing monumental, of course, but it's still a nice little thing.
"the BIG big boss told me ‚ÄúDUDE! thanks‚Äù in MS teams when i sent him a really large excel sheet i put together for a project i‚Äôm working on. it‚Äôs the little things, and that made me super satisfied that he liked my spreadsheet. 

i‚Äôd like to think i‚Äôm better with excel than the average bear :)"
I had problems with the bank this morning, they charged me fees that shouldn‚Äôt have been charged. I spent an hour in the branch arguing about being refunded because these fees are invalid. That stuck me in a bad mood, and when I made my stop at a vape shop to get some pods, the cashier gave me a pack of pods (~18.50$ value) of a discontinued flavour I would always buy he found in the back for free. That made me really happy, then throughout my work day I was filled with positive thoughts and a great mindset. This post is perfect timing. Coincidence?
I will go to Florida (while social distancing, mask wearing, etc) in a week and a half or so. I'm excited!!! Also, I am getting a new shaver for my legs. Not much, but it is good.
My mom came over today and we watched some dvds I recorded from old home videos she had. We watched some where my brother as a baby had so many of the same mannerisms as his son. We both cried. I love her so much
I met up with my best friend. Don't worry we were outside and respected the 2 metre distance. It was nice to talk to somebody face to face :)
Got a new surfboard this weekend (thanks grandma!) and had a great session this morning. Love working from home.

"I sat with my friend for the first time since March. Back then she was 24 hours sober and still pretty fucked up. 

Now she‚Äôs happy, healthy and sober since then!"
My eight month old smiled from his crib when I walked into the room. He does it every morning when he sees me. It‚Äôs my small daily dose of happiness.
"I played this game called ‚ÄúManeater‚Äù and the mindless fun brought joy to me.

I‚Äôm often empty, so this helped."
I opened up Instagram and it was full of black squares. I'm a metalhead primarily and second to that is any sort of music that's weird and experimental, Swans, Daughters, clipping., Sunn O))), Radiohead, etc. I've always loved this music because I find it and the musicians behind it to be the most sincere and emotional, and they did not disappoint. I listen to a lot of bands and follow them all, my feed was endless black squares, and not just from American bands. Jinjer from Ukraine; Benn, Hacktivist, and Idles from England; Gojira from France; KMFDM from Germany; Suicide Commando from Belgium; Thy Art is Murder from Australia; Heilung who has members from all over Europe but none in the US. Everyone is fighting for this and it is powerful to see.
I got my box springs in that I ordered!! 6 yrs of sleeping on slates and made for a super lumpy bed.  Wife and I couldn't be happier.  We originally had box springs, but at the time my daughter was a baby and she fell off the bed twice.  So we chunked them after that.  Sleeping better tonight!

"I was sitting in my best friends‚Äô garden (keeping socially distant of course) in the sun just chatting away about absolutely nothing, but it was the first time we‚Äôd seen each other in the flesh for 10 weeks and it was just really nice.

Also we saw just randomly saw an angry face in the sky which was very funny."
I took some thoughts that had been keeping me up at night and wrote them down and tried to make some sense of out it, and it turned into a pretty solid piece of writing that I‚Äôm proud of. It‚Äôs not much, but being able to channel those feelings productively into something that I enjoy is a big step for me.
Saw some old messages between me and my crush.Because of this pandemic we aren't texting frequently.But seeing those cute flirty text messages (she flirted too!) from 4-6 months ago surely made my day!
After 6 weeks of debilitating and depressing morning sickness and waking up feeling ill and not wanting to eat, I woke up feeling hungry.
Woke up to my dog in my bed this morning. She's been exclusively sleeping on the couch since she got sick/was put on medicine. Means she's no longer feeling the side effects of the medicine and is back to being her happy little self!
There‚Äôs a pair of shoes I‚Äôve been wanting but they are kind of expensive... finally I decided to pull the trigger and they were actually on sale today! Also free shipping!!!
I held the door for a little kid and he thanked me for it. It reminded me that there's still some good left in this world.
I was told that they could treat my eye problem. They have to do at least 3 injections (ugh) but it will be OK. Thank goodness.
I walked 2 miles without stopping. I've been horribly out of shape for years but I've started walking everyday, its only been three weeks and I've tripled the distant i can walk and I feel super proud of myself for the first time in a long time
A friend of mine came by for a surprise visit and we talked/played games for a while aaaand I was on a FaceTime call with my guy best friend for several hours aaand yeahhhhüòÅüòÅ much happiness

My husband made time for us after a few very rough days/weeks. We managed to go for a walk and get my car washed.. and had fun during it. I got my friend back ‚ù§
It's my sister's birthday today and we had a picnic in the garden, painted and ordered Pizza for dinner. It was a really nice day :)
My cat woke me up by flopping onto her side, cuddling up against me, and purring. Not much, but she's always a real sweetheart.
My work colleague got an ice lolly stuck to his tongue. When I got home a plane drew a smiley face in the sky!
"I'm actually not depressed today. I am typically a happy go lucky gal. But since the world exploded I have had terrible sadness and lethargy. My house has been a mess which is not like me.

Today, I actually feel like a human. I don't know what it is. But I was productive at work and also snuck in some chores between calls. I have already prepped dinner and don't feel so gloomy.  I don't know what happened but whatever it is, I hope I snapped out of it and can get back to feeling better and normal. 

Much love to my depressed people out there. Hang in there and keep reaching out to your friends! My friends definitely have been helping pull me (even drag me) through this difficult time."
Soloed 'Providence, The Profaned Goddess' on Revengance mode! Wasn't a no-hit run, for sure.. but I did it!
Well we went out on the boat to fish, didn‚Äôt catch a thing. We forgot water and sunscreen, so we were thirsty and hot, out motor died so we had to paddle our way back, we went to get some food and they messed up my order. So overall, my day was great
Leftover happiness from last night because I saw my boyfriend after two months! We live in different states and have been long distance because of covid. Made me feel light as a feather.
"My unborn baby kicked me all morning long. LoL
It makes me so happy to know she is there.
She is an IVF baby, and will be 33 weeks tomorrow!
My husband and I tried to have children for 12 years before having success through IVF. :)"
"My 15 year old daughter has been having a really hard time lately. Depression, cutting, she made a really dumb choice at school 2 yrs ago and it‚Äôs just been following her around since. She‚Äôs been very withdrawn and just sad all the time. I‚Äôve been trying to get her to open up to me and talk to me (I, too, suffer from anxiety and depression) and just letting her know that I‚Äôm here for her. All through out this, she‚Äôs maintained a 3.86 grade point average. She‚Äôs always had big college dreams. This morning she presents me with a letter basically just telling me how she‚Äôs been feeling and she wants us to begin to trust her. She‚Äôs learned a very hard lesson and she now understands how choices can derail her future goals. We talked and I told her that she does NOT have to feel shame for what happened a year ago. But she does need to learn that every action has consequences and her future and choices are in her hands. 

Basically it was HUGE triumph in our family and I‚Äôm ready to walk behind her in this new beginning.

*edited to add that it brings tears to my eyes just typing this out because I am just SO proud of her."
Got off work early, hopped in my car and blasted the AC and Out of Time by Rolling Stones came and on I dunno why but that just gave me a happy vibe :)

"I bought my parents t-shirts with ""supermom"" and ""superdad"" and superman logos on them for mother and fathers day. Its not much but the look on their faces made me so happy :D"
I was out grabbing lunch today when I saw what I initially thought was a dumpy looking man wearing a sundress. As the person got closer something was off with that person and I could not tell what the deal was. Finally they had walked close enough to me that I could see it was not a man, but some woman wearing a fake beard as a mask. Weirdest damn thing I have seen in a while, i wanted to ask if she thought it protect her from any virus, but I was afraid of what the answer would be. Still it has made me laugh all day.
I got a doctor's appointment at an office literally 2 minutes from my house.  I've been seeking a new one for myself and my daughter since I moved here at the end of December.
There's a pair of hawks that live in my neighborhood and I saw them gliding around earlier. I think birds of prey are really neat.
I made it to my drug test earlier than expected and my phone was dying, so I went to the nearest phone store since I didn‚Äôt have my charger on me. I asked if they had a disposable/temporary charger, but the employee just said I could use one of the charges meant for the displays. Then he remembered he had a spare charger in the back and let me use it until I had to go to my appointment. When I was thanking him afterward, he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt just sell things.‚Äù He was so kind, and the store wasn‚Äôt even the network I‚Äôm on üòÖ Made my day üòä
Got the green light on a huge deal we're trying to close this month and that will put us into healthy bonus check territory. Compared to last quarter's numbers... I may cry.
After not flying for 4 months I finally was able to resume my flight training and did very well for the amount of time spent off.
It was my sons second birthday. I don't think he quite knows what that means but he was so happy and the day was full of smiles.
"My puppy I got two days ago is currently asleep with her head on my leg. 

Who cares that she wakes us up at 4am? Who cares she‚Äôs pooing and peeing everywhere? She‚Äôs perfect and she‚Äôs mine and I would die for this little bundle of joy.

Only thing is... I can‚Äôt move now."
Took my motorcycle out, saw a sweet 60s truck pulling through the intersection and stared at it and the dude pointed at me and clicked his teeth, and I pointed back. It's the little things.
"There was a bunch of lay-offs today as were going through a merger. I still have a job. 

My heart goes out to my colleagues ü•∫"
I had the first call with a doctor about my wife's pregnancy. We found out this weekend that she's pregnant after a few months of trying. I'm not allowed to tell anyone yet but we're both very excited.
I finished my partner's speech, I did my entire Physics project in 1 sitting (10/10 thank you very much) and I got a script that I have been thinking about for the last 2 months finally figured out. Oh, and it's my cake day!
Spending time with my babies. Not being with someone that was unhealthy for me and them. Just feeling free and content.
"I went outside with my dog, and it‚Äôs 97 degrees today. He, for some reason that i cannot comprehend, just ran back and forth on the lawn while i sat in the shade. He got tired, and eventually went to the door. I opened it for him and he drank so. much. water. 


he‚Äôs so cute ü•∫"
I made decorated focaccia for the first time for a girl's night and got compliments on it and my dalgona coffees !!

My husband is over 2 years sober and he came home safe after 3 deployments overseas, both of those are blessings and make me happy every single day!!
We all have our bad days and we all can point out the bad but finding your blessings everyday will change your life!"
"1- Started a new TV show called sharp objects 
2- my husband said we‚Äôd have take out so I don‚Äôt need to cook"
It‚Äôs my birthday tomorrow! I had a few friends over to my garden for the first time in about 3 months (we socially distanced of course and we are allowed to meet up in groups of 6 as long as social distancing is maintained.) it was amazing to see them again and have a good laugh with each other.
"I‚Äôve been living in campus housing the last 11 weeks, and jobless, as an international student at my uni. 

Today, I finalised plans to move into a flat with a good friend of mine, as I was going to be basically homeless from 28th June - now I‚Äôm not! One thing down, just have to get a job now."
I started what will be the final draft of my first major short film. It should be finished by the end of this month and soon after I hope to begin production! Maybe it won't lead to a career, but I'm just happy I'll finally get to tell this story. I've procrastinated for far too long.

The compliment made me happy but what really makes me happier than that Is my effort to spread positivity to people who deserve it are being noticed!"
A deer rammed its head through a park bench on a popular walking path and strangled itself to death, leaving a tangled-up contorted corpse on display for all the passersby to see. The town was quite scandalized.
The wife and I set up a little date night tonight. Nothing fancy... going down to the bay, getting some takeout, heading home to watch movies, etc. Great escape from the hassle of transitioning jobs and moving houses. It's the simple things, folks.

Watching Avatar the last air Bender. First time watching it after putting it off for so long. Love it
I work at a shitty work place and i don't know why but when my brother in law told me about other job offers that his friend recommended made me happy and my job searching fire sparked up again. I gave up on it because I thought I was useless and thought I deserved to only work at a job like this but I know I can do better.
I'm booked my son's bday party today. I rented a theater so he and his friends can play video games on a huge screen.
I took my kids to the beach for ten minutes early this morning to avoid people. Happiest I've felt in months. Didnt last as people started to turn up, we needed to go before we got bottle necked in.
Finally got back to see my family in another country, after being 4 months in another country (where I live), alone due to quarantine and occasional martial law. Happy day for me :)
Got to see a close family member (from a distance) for the first time since March due to the current situation
Hopefully today's the day I get rid of this sickness! If not, I get my tonsils out and I'll eat a ton of ice cream, so it's a win-win :)
The way my cat snuggled up to me this morning. He nestled himself right in my arms and started purring. Good start to my day
Went for a longboard ride with my best friend for the first time in years. Stopped at Tim Hortons and got coffee and went to a record store to look for some stuff for his collection. Happiest I've been in a while.

My parents greenlit me hanging out with my boyfriend! I haven't gone on a date since valentine's day, and last saw him at school during the middle of March
My house mate who usually just keeps all day and doesn't so anything, was awake this morning, all dressed up in a shirt and trousers, rolled me a ciggy and made me a cup of tea for breakfast AND tidied my room. At first I thought he wanted to borrow money but no, he was just being nice.
My friend who I've been helping get over her anxiety finally asked out a girl she's been falling for hard. They both ended up confessing feelings for each other. Made my whole day.
"I posted a pic of a cat stalking me through the window. I‚Äôve never got that many upvotes!
I also bought some new stuff for my room (curtains, lamp,...). Now I get why the Sims are happy when you buy new stuff for their house :D.
And it was raining heavily today. Which is good because the drought here is kinda getting out of hand."
After what I think was hundreds of attempts, I finally found one of my favorite animal crossing villagers on a mystery island! :)
The college where I work asked us if they could record some of us reading children's books and post the videos online. I got to do a reading today and it was a lot of fun and a nice 'break' from my daily work.
"Nothing. I woke up anxious and depressed, I ate too much breakfast just because it was on my plate. 

Now I‚Äôm laying in bed, avoiding chores and responsibilities because it all seems so overwhelming when I think about it."
"Nothing :( I've been house shopping and every house that we like ends up being sold within days, and often times above asking price. There hasnt been 1 new house posted today for the little bit of excitement I get when I see a new property listed. And if we search for slightly cheaper houses so that we can afford offering above asking they're all hideous.

As of this week we're full time back at the office but I only started working for this company a week before quarantine started so I have no friends here and with the new strict rules of no mingling, it's very lonely at work.

I just want friends at work and to find a house that's not a dump in a dumpy neighborhood"
VTO at work just as my stomach was starting to make the kinds of noises that sound like the gates of hell about to open.
I woke up at 6 am on the pavement of 38th and Chicago with multiple other people while protesting the death of George Floyd and police brutality. We all came together, told stories, laughed together and brainstormed peacefully through the curfew. The sight of so many people coming together for the same cause was heartwarming. ‚úäüèΩ
While I was jogging and listening to music, this one really motivating verse played, and I looked up at the sky at the same moment. It was just perfectly sunny and blue with fluffy clouds, and I realized how beautiful the day was. It was like I saw the sky through new eyes for a few moments.
I learned a new trick (the trick was cab flip) today while skateboarding and I beat Darkeater Midir in Dark Souls 3.

A friend of mine and his girlfriend, who are both in really good shape like a professional model body types, said to my girlfriend and myself that we both look very good.

Finally took off braces after 4 years (age 13-17) my teeth were pretty cursed, but now its all good :)
I saw a couple walking two golden retrievers on my bike ride this morning. I lost mine to cancer in October and haven't really seen a dog in person for a while due to quarantine and all. One of the good boys really wanted to say hello as I rode by (alas I couldn't, because I respect social distancing), it made me tear up a little, I miss my old girl, but it did brighten my day none the less.
"Doubled my money on a stock I bought yesterday.

I got to wake up next to my boyfriend. We don‚Äôt live together yet (we will in August if all goes as planned) so time spent with him is really special to me. We made cookies and then ordered delivery from one of my favorite local restaurants. Now we‚Äôre just laying in bed watching TV.
Got back one of very old and very precious friend. I missed him so much. Very happy to have him back.
I got accepted to college and start working towards my bachelor's in finance at the end of this month!
Took on something brand new at work, out of my element and did really well. Got great kudos from the owners and colleagues

Had class. Relevant class. Bomb teacher and classmates. 

Then I went on to do some more squats and pushups. 

Duolingo. Speedcubing. Touchtyping. Chesstempo. Crochet.

And now I'm taking a break by playing Mordhau.

And it's only 2 pm. Very productive day. A lot to do."
"I had a tough day, really felt useless and miserable, really low on the self compassion...then a redditor shared this song with me thats like not even my type of thing, but I loved it and felt like somebody did something nice for me, even though they were just sharing a song they liked.

"I had an exam, my teacher didn't had time to make some questions for the exam so he just copied a pdf from internet.

What happened next was a guy finding the answers to the pdf by searching an address on it. Now all of us have high grades."
My husband got a promotion that comes with a great raise AND his mom got a new job that pays way better than the one she has been looking to leave! It was a great day job wise for the family today.
I came to terms with the fact that I‚Äôm probably going to try to kill myself again & that‚Äôs ok. Life isn‚Äôt for everyone & I am very tired.
"I fell on my ass in a local home improvement store. 

I was walking while putting a receipt in my pocket and didn't notice that the floor was wet. Seconds before, another patron had dropped a bottle of soap, and it blew up. 

Soap is very slippery

I made a cute midwestern ope sound and fell on my phone on my butt on the soap. Everyone around me was asking me if I was all right, and helping me up. my phone had that Schrodinger moment of simultaneously being broken and whole. Thankfully, it was observed as a whole

I only felt a little bit like an idiot, and was genuinely pleased with all of these strangers being so kind and helpful. Even though I was sore, I had a stupid grin behind my mask while I finished my shopping"
I haven‚Äôt been happy all day. But I did get a package I ordered. Which I guess did come with a positive emotional charge, however ineffective against my disposition.
My one mean dumb boss lost a check somebody gave him and my other mean dumb boss shipped a $3,000 piece of equipment to a guy who didn't order it, just asked about it. So, they're yelling at each other instead of me, and their mistakes are waaaay bigger than my little hickups from time to time that they like to blow out of proportion.
I‚Äôm late to the party but my sister let me pick one of her dresses to wear for the last school ball/party, I love my sister a lot and I‚Äôm so grateful for her<3
"I live next door to my granparents, and they always joke about that I only come over there for food or when I want something. Today, before online classes, I walked next door not having breakfast yet and talked with them, then showed me some jars of mango jam that my family could have. So asked my grandpa, 

‚ÄúLast time the mango jam was a bit chunky, do think I could try it with some waffles to see if I like it?‚Äù.

He said ‚Äúsure thing! Wait-‚Äú.

Then we both burst out laughing"
My three year old cousin let go of a balloon filled with helium outside and as it was going up, he said ‚ÄúKobe Bryant, CATCH!‚Äù
This seems small but i was able to negotiate a work deadline from end of day today to noon tomorrow. I work in consulting... small wins for life!!!
Fixed up an old power washer and got it going for a little bit! Taking a bit of a break right now but I'm gonna clean my mom's patio üòÅ
My patient with a brain injury was able to read and understand a whole paragraph with only a little help. I was also able to put him on regular liquids (instead of thickened), so he was able to have the smoothie he wanted.
Me and my gf are moving to a new place in a couple weeks. It's smaller but a hella lot nicer (and cheaper) than the one we're currently in. Anyway, landlord gave me the keys today and told me I can start moving stuff into the new apartment. The first box i moved in was my comic book collection. Felt really nice!
"My grandmother (second mother), made me dinner today.

Anytime a person, related or non related, can feed me my appreciation is at the most high."
My cat didn‚Äôt die last night from his shenanigans involving my razor and his mouth. I‚Äôve been beginning to put my razor on the top shelf of my shower.
I FINALLY finished most of my school work today, I was a complete dumbass ever since school closed and switched to all computer at home stuff
sitting here, in my home office, talkin to my roomate who just got home. we're just shootin the shit, drinkin some beers. work **really** sucked today, and tommorows lookin pretty bleak as well, but damn if *right now* ain't fuckin perfect. He's about to take his dogs for a walk, and I am gunna crank some tunes and eat pizza
Someone's lost dog on Facebook turned back up. Also, I saw my parents briefly. They were dropping off an old desk chair from my room back home.
Not a single thing, sadly. I‚Äôm broke, just started a new job last week and bills are piling up before my first paycheck. I live in a shitty mobile home with bad electrical wiring and the tv and air conditioner in the living room don‚Äôt work. I want to play my guitar but I‚Äôll probably be lectured because there are more important things in life. Maybe I settled down too soon... I‚Äôm 30 and feel like I‚Äôm going on 70.
There‚Äôs a BLM protest near me. I can‚Äôt march because of corona (my parents are at high risk), but I put some Gatorade and water out and I‚Äôve seen people who can protest take it. Makes me happy because I‚Äôm participating without endangering my family
"My cat fell asleep in my lap and is now snoring. 

She does this every day, and it makes me happy every day."
Earlier, I was having really bad stomach pain that caused me to curl up on the floor. My cat decided to lay down next to me and make me pet her. Even though the pain stopped awhile ago, she hasn‚Äôt left my side since.
I rode 40 kilometers by bike with my 10yo daughter. Riding my bike always makes me happy. But together with my daughter made it even better.
"I somehow made a 50k upvote comment on a thread -- far and away more upvotes than any other comment I've ever made.

&#x200B;

It may just be internet points, but I still got a kick out of it"
My uncle doesn't want to come back to town yet, so I loaded his quad on the back of his boat and am heading to their cabin til sunday! Fresh muskrat, duck, rabbit, SALMON!! Fkya
I made a huge coding breakthrough in some programs I‚Äôm making.(I‚Äôm only 13, so this might not be a breakthrough for any experienced programmer, but I‚Äôm new so ANYTHING is a breakthrough.) If you wanna hear more about the programs you can DM me.
I spent many hours on some mission in gta V with friend and after dying like 30+ times, we finally did it xD
"I got a gift in the mail from some family, they bought us something off of our wedding registry even though we had to cancel because of COVID. 

I also made a task chart for myself to try to complete at least three tasks today (such as mopping the floors, taking out the trash, washing the walls, etc) to help motivate me to clean the house (I'm usually quite tidy, but I'm on vacation for the summer and also been kind of depressed lately, so finding motivation to do simple tasks is sometimes tough, and this chart is helping me!) it makes me feel better and accomplished, and it's not leaving the SO to do all the housework while they are also working all day as well (when I'm working they do more housework because my job is quite demanding on me physically and mentally, but when I'm on vacation I usually take over as the main person who cleans the house, and they can focus more on working.)"
I haven‚Äôt had a drivers license in 18yrs because of mistakes I made in my 20‚Äôs. After 4yrs of expensive attorneys and hearings, today I officially registered a car in my name and put legal plates on it. Next week is the driving test and hopefully the end of that chapter in my life.
"I went in to work today for the first time since March 18.

It was so nice to turn my head to ask a question instead of having to email or Zoom someone."
All of the drivers I followed onto the freeway accelerated enough to get up to the proper speed and not disrupt the flow of traffic. Absolute bliss!
Damn. Everyone else is happy because they acheived something, or someone is ok. Im just happy i ordered a pizza today
(bit of a camera nerd over here sorry). Tested some color grading with a log color profile for the first time and was very happy with the results. Also a new studio softbox light came in that'll make work super easier for a shoot we have this week. Again a bit nerdy, but made me really happy with how everything turned out good.
This may be smaller than everyone else's post but I finally am getting a hang of my algebra it's very hard for me. The school year is almost over and I have many math assignments to do. I have about 1/4 done and it feels good!
As a nursing student today I was allowed back to the hospital to do my clinicals and was able to be with mothers and their precious new babies. It was perfect
I rescued a stray kitten and my friends adopted and it‚Äôs very happy now. Really loves them already. Warms my heart!
Worked out again today after yesterday, which is always good news because the more I workout, the better my mental health gets!
the sun shone onto my partners face in such an angelic way at the graveyard, it felt like the world stopped spinning for just a moment. pure bliss
I was able to finally make pro designs in Animal crossing, so I spent about 2 hours making different stuff, including a first order t-shirt.
It‚Äôs been a busy and expectedly stressful day of work, but I still took 15 minutes and made myself a really tasty sandwich for lunch. So that‚Äôs nice. After work I bet my day will significantly improve.
As i type im getting my memorial tattoo for my dad colored and shaded, i havent been this happy in a long time
The Walmart in Minneapolis where my cousin works is still up and running and hasn't been too badly affected by the riots. She has MS and right now there aren't many companies that would be willing to make accommodations for her disability. So if her Walmart gets burned down or destroyed or whatever, she could be unemployed for quite a while, and she really likes the independence associated with having a job
All of the black out Tuesday posts, I haven‚Äôt been able to see any memes at all today on Instagram, thankfully Reddit is better for memes though
Hung out with some friends that I haven‚Äôt seen since March, because of social distancing. Was really fun to catch up with them, and distract myself from all the shit going.
"Finally got our Switch! My husband has been wanting one since they were released but we were always too broke. We got one to celebrate his graduation from undergrad, and it took us a few days before we were able to snag one, so we are very excited to play tonight. He's still at work and it is taking every ounce of willpower for me to keep working and not open it before he comes home.

Edit to add: my husband also just found out he was promoted to full time with benefits at his current employment. Today is a great day!"
I saw the bravest injured 6 year old at work who wasn't distracted or upset by his injury (seen adults beside themselves with similar, and it wasn't a minor injury) but we talked about super hero's and milkshakes!
I've been putting cat food outside my house every midnight because I saw little stray cats right across the street. Although they ran away whenever I get near them, today's the day they finally walked up to me and let me pet them!
Last time I was on the phone with my grandmother she talked about having a Grimms fairytale book when she was a kid. I went on amazon and ordered a hardcover copy for her and sent it to her with a note. She called me crying today when she received it. She was so happy so that made me happy. Best 20 bucks I ever spent
My girlfriend stopped by my work to give me a snack. It was little but meant the world to me because she knows I never take a break for lunch. I love that woman.
My almost 5 month old is starting to crawl! It‚Äôs bitter sweet because my husband is deployed and missing it. Still made me happy!
I was picking up groceries to make twice baked potatoes. I had like 3 things and the ladies with the cart in front of me let me go first. AND THEN another cashier arrived so we both got to go first. It was awesome
"My sister finally spared some time and watched a movie with me!! And also, my online ""tests"" are finally done with. Ahhh freedom."
I play disc golf, and I recently got 5 new ones. Threw all 5 today, tied my best score on the year so far..thats a win for me!
After about a year without stable internet access I was finally able to have a few proper matches of LoL with some old friends back home, I know it‚Äôs just a game but it was nice being able to do something with them while we talked.
"I read an article about a protest in TN.  


Peaceful protesters advanced on the Capital building. Protesters asked the National Guard to lay down their shields. The Guard laid down the shields, and the protests remained peaceful. As we have seen, time and again, de-escalation is the solution required if police *really* want to end the violence."
I went on a little road trip with my daughter and sister in law. We bought used books and had takeout sushi. The first time things have felt anywhere close to normal in a long time.
Yesterday I made coconut macaroons dipped in dark chocolate and the whole family enjoyed them, but I hid one without their knowledge and ate that one today in secret and it was THE BEST!
"It is 93 degrees outside, I'm working remotely, and I hate winter/being cold/shivering.

I friggin love when it's 6 am, the lawn is already dry, and it's bright enough to jog, but the sun is just barely up."
After a full work day without being able to breath through my nose because of allergic reactions, I can finally breath through my nose after a nose shower
I randomly got super inspired to draw for the first time in months as I had art block, and I‚Äôm actually happy with what I‚Äôve made.
I saw a Final Fantasy VII Remake bus today. I always see cool stuff like that online, but never out in real life, so it made me really excited!
2 girls out Of no where startes flirting wirh me droppin hints even i, the dumbest guy ever could see, that was a bit of a confidence boost
"I work in the mobile infant room of a day care. Since everything started we‚Äôve reinforced our policies for handwashing, including singing for timing.

After every diaper change, I get my kids to the sink built into the diaper counter (it‚Äôs a nice setup, tbh), lay my kid on their belly, get their hands wet and soapy, and sing. Most of the babies LOVE this part, playing in the water, being snuggled (held close in case of wiggles on the high counter), and of course the singing.

They get the biggest grin, especially when I sit them up, dry their hands, and give a BIG hug as I pick them up to get them back onto the floor to play."
"My 10 year old son has been growing his hair out again, and it's just now gotten long enough to put into a ponytail. My husband bought him his own pack of hair ties. And today, during his Distance Learning Show and Share, his ponytail is what he decided to share. 

The TINIEST things make him so excited and happy, and I love that so much!"
I am not unemployed and I love my job! I get to produce video games with a bad ass group of wildly creative, intelligent, and downright interesting people
The local bunny population has become completely unafraid of humans because we are home all the time and don't bother them. Today one of them was munching grass 4 feet away from my screen door. I walk past the screen door with some toast, it looks at me, I look at it, then we both carry on eating our breakfast.
I got my first pedicure with my girlfriend today. My feet feel so clean and refreshed! Will definitely be doing this again!
I found a bike yesterday being given away for free and today I stripped it down and fixed it. Felt good as its my first venture into bike repair
Went to see a therapist for the first time, it was amazing and I really believe she's helping me get better!
I got overstressed from a few projects for my school due this on Tuesday the 10th and I found out they were super easy. Started on one at 10 it‚Äôs 2 now I‚Äôm almost done with the first project
"Absolutely fucking nothing. I am angry and sad and nothing (not even a goddamn multiple orgasm) is going to make me ""happy"" today."
"After enduring a 2 hour FNA biopsy to confirm that he has thyroid cancer my 16 year old son was singing on the way home. 

He, like me, can't carry a tune but hearing him belt out music he loves makes me the happiest I could ever be."
"My four month old baby learned the ""mmm"" sound. When she babbled at me, she said ""mama.""

There's no meaning to the sounds yet, and it was just an accident. A fluke as she experiments with phonemes. But it melted my heart to hear her say it, nonetheless!"
"I got a message from my ex today saying I can come over to hang with her and the kids tomorrow. They‚Äôre not even mine but she lets me visit them every other week anyways. 
The perks of having a kind hearted ex."
Unbeknownst to me, my wife bought a toy doctor kit for my 2 year old. It came in the mail today and the 4 of us (6 year old included) have been playing with it for the last two hours.
"I went live on Reddit first time. I never even recorded I was shy to even speak. I got a pretty good interaction. When i started drawing, i got overwhelmed. I got 240 unique viewers. Then it got removed for out of topic. 
I replied to the mods that I'm sorry and I had fun. The reply I had was nice. 
Overall, great"
"Oh, that's a good one.

Today I went by a kindergarten and was watching the kids play through the trees while walking by (more like marvelling over the cool playground). In front of me was a young man doing the same. 

As I went by him he turned to me ans said: ""You know, that was my kindergarten."" And I stopped and he told me about his kindergarten memories. I told him about mine and we went our ways.

This really made my day.

Tltr; Casual talk about kindergarten time with a total stranger."
I tutored my 6 year old cousin in reading and math. He‚Äôs just such a beautiful soul: kind, smart, and funny. Honestly, he gave me hope.
I redecorated my room yesterday. I covered my wall with pictures and paintings and hung my rainbow flag over one of my windows. When I woke up today, my room was bathed in a bunch of colors because of the flag and I was reminded of all of the things I've seen, the places I've been, and the people I've met. It was really wonderful.
My village in animal crossing celebrated my birthday. I‚Äôm a man in his mid 30s that hasn‚Äôt ever been a birthday celebration kinda guy... but with all the depressing as shit news in the states now, that kind gesture from my islanders made me smile and forget, for a moment that thinks are sometimes not bad :)
Seeing the millions of people coming together for black out Tuesday. Is wholesome to see how if people want something they will strive until they cannot anymore
I was driving down the highway, and saw a little toddler hand holding a stuffed animal out the window. As I drove passed she had a big smile and was just watching her stuffed friend flying through the air. She looked like she was just enjoying the fuck out of her innocent little life.
I'm adopting a dog for the first time and am bringing her home tonight!! She has a couple of health issues and will need special care for the next few months, but I'm so excited to bring her into my life!
Finally had the guts to finish off some minor, but still necessary work that I had left lying around for weeks now. Feels good to having checked all these todo lists after weeks of COVID induced um motivation!
My desktop broke and after ordering parts and nearly 4 hours figuring out what was wrong....my epic house mate rebuilt it and it works again!
My parents stopped by for a surprise visit today! They live 3 hours away, and I don‚Äôt get to see them much.
"For the first time in my life I celebrated being in a relationship for 6 months. I've never been with someone for this long.

I love her and I couldn't be happier."
"I found one my of my oldest teachers on Facebook and we had a good talk today!!! 

This teacher is still trying to get French out of me"
I got to visit with my elderly aunt while driving her to and from an eye specialist. She‚Äôs had glaucoma for decades, and she is thankful for every sight she sees. The whole time, we talked about all the beautiful things we observed from the road.
"I've been waiting for months to hear if I can get licensure for a job I applied to in February. They want me to work, but because of my age there were a few hoops to jump through. Its been kind of an anxious wait since it's a job that would be incredible for my future career.

I got a call saying I got it today!!"
I improvised and made a really tasty spicy sauce to go with my fries (really wasn‚Äôt expecting it to work! Just had some time to kill while waiting for food to cook)
I possibly have covit as of this morning and was tested BUT when I possibly got infected (if I have it then I got it while I was at work at the hospital) till now my kids were at their dads house and will stay there till I'm not sick so I don't need to worry about giving it to them. This made me the happiest today and for the next 14 days it will continue.
I walked 11.1 miles around my hometown with my buddy from college and we got lemonades and later ice cream and it was a good walk. My feet definitely hurt though!
Was able to sneak out for a run over lunch today and brought my doggo with me.  The look of pure joy when he realizes I‚Äôm going running and that he gets to come with me, such a freaking awesome feeling!
Hasn't happened yet, but I'm going on my third date with a girl I recently met. After moving to Portland 7 months ago I'm finally making a friend through no one else but myself and building a genuine connection with someone. Our first date started as coffee and sitting at a park and that turned into 5 hours of walking around and her showing me different parts of the city.
I woke up next to my girlfriend, kissed her forehead without waking her, then rolled over and went right back to sleep.
Well today I checked my car codes to see if it has any problems left and it read no codes :D yesterday I managed to fix the abs and traction control and when my diagnostic scanner arrived today I read the codes and everything is working great.
"I restored an old(8yrs) laptop of mine using parts I swapped from an almost unused but with a dead motherboard laptop I found in ebay. It was not working probably due to one ore more connectors shorting/IO board issues.

The IO board, couple of small things like better trackpad, working bluetooth and webcam modules, working DVD drive and a newer back case and top case were swapped out from the ebay one.

It has 8 GB RAM upgrade(max it supports), an i5 processor upgrade and SSD upgrade - all these are extras i bought separately.

windows 10 installed using product key I found in the back of the ebay laptop. 

It Booted to Windows in 4 secs :)

edit: browsing from said laptop now..."
"I work as a cashier at big box store. Guy had like $2.50 in change and said I can keep it as he walked away.

Its not much, but still made me happy"
I have my own IG that's based around my hobby, Gunpla, and today and during the last week my two favorite people in the scene followed me back. It's awesome. Like they're my heroes and gives more validation to what I'm trying to do in the scene. :)

In my personal life, my son spent time with his cousins and had a blast while I had to go work."
Today my boss said ive been doing an amazing job. I also went to our local Asian market for the first time (im new to the area and needed specialty ingredients) and man it was nice! I got kaffir lime leaves, chili oil, shrimp chips, and lemon grass for SIX DOLLARS!
My boss got mad at me this morning but when the day was going by he wasn‚Äôt mad at me anymore. I know it sounds lame but I ended up feeling better
I found out that my horse that we were told had unknown breeding was actually a very fancy horse with a very good pedigree that we got for quite cheap!
My son and I took coffee pods, power bars and other little tidbits down to the fire station. Just felt good
I presented my finished bachelor thesis and the professor responsible for my grade said that it was one of the best thesis essays he has ever read
"Most of our nearby relatives came over to pray for my grandaunt's recent passing. We had a family dinner right after where social distancing was practiced to ensure everyone's safety. 

I was also able to reunite with my 2 y.o nephew who I've missed. Taught him some silly dances and watched a couple of episodes of spongebob too."
I woke up next to my girlfriend and got to spend time just being in love. It happens every morning but it still makes me just as happy as it did the first time.
"My period came... 

That's definitely makes me feel amazing and happy and glorious and lowkey nOt wanting to die 

Of course, yes my period."
I stood on a bridge over a Motorway. I was waving to the cars and the people in them waving back made me happy :)
A person whom I haven't seen since high school (almost 30 years ago) recognized me while I was wearing a face mask.  She said she remembered my eyes.  I'll ride that compliment for months.
"My dispatcher informed me that today's an easy day for work. 

I'm gonna be productive and get home early."
I got away without playing $60 for petrol. I told the lady at the servo that I need to pay for it and she didn‚Äôt let me pay for it so I walked out
"Not that it happened today but I became aware of it today. 

The Black Lives Matter solidarity. 

I am of course sad about the state of things and as a non-black person I can't say I know what it's like but as an ethnic minority I know what it's like to be treated differently based on the colour of your skin.

I remember a couple years back when the movement first made internet headlines. The predominant amount of supporters were strictly black people, not other ethnic minorities or white people(generalisation). Other than on the internet, most of the world outside of the U.S.(including my country) had not paid much mainstream attention to it. I thought that for us standing up for the cause internationally were hopeless. Our efforts would never reach those that needed it. 

That has changed.

Now in my country as well as many other countries in the world, we stand with you. Communities whether they be subreddits, religions, and other races have all come together to show you the solidarity you deserved years ago. People are once more waking up to the modern horrors of racism and we won't be silent. 

I'd like to also offer an apology to the black community from the Asian community. While I don't represent all of them and indeed I don't even share a lot of the same beliefs, if my words mean anything I'd like to speak on behalf of them. As an Asian I felt it my duty and responsibility to stand up next to my black brothers and sisters, it led me to build a library in Ethiopia and become a board member of an African & Caribbean society. A lot of my fellow Asians remained silent and uninvolved. While I do condemn a lot of them for assimilating with the local population so much they have somehow removed themselves(in their own minds) from the trappings of being a minority, all the while willfully ignoring the racism they experience themselves. You have to understand that the Asian culture is based a lot on conformity and the condemnation of attitude that go against the grain. For this reason a lot of Asians have remained silent when it came to speaking up for both themselves and their ethnic brethren. This is however changing, more and more of us are finding our voices and some of us(me) have felt that the fight against racism you've been carrying the torch of, is for us too. Every fight against discrimination, every step taken in the right direction was for all minorities too. It is for this that I felt an obligation to return the favour. Had it not been for the words of MLK that changed America and by extension the world, I would not be able to live my life the way I do. 

I therefore ask for your forgiveness on behalf of ""my people"", for the previous lack of solidarity and the current lack of action. This will change and in the future you can expect our sincere support. 

Also please do not mistake our respective governments' attitude as ours. Most of us have no power to change how things are in our home country, but we can change how we interact with you. 

Peace and love ‚ù§"
Talked to my brother for about 45 minutes. In most ways, we share a brain, and we almost intuitively know what the other is thinking, even over the phone. We've stayed very close over the years, and he's one of the most important people in my life.
being in a cross world long distance is a pain and loads of anxiety, but I'm pretty happy that my girlfriend chose me, and my pastor supports and isn't questioning my choice thus far
"I looked at my 3k karma!

But seriously. That's 3000 people who have at some point looked at something I have said and they either agreed, or it made them laugh! Hopefully meaning I made 3 thousands people's day a minuscule amount better in theory :)

Look at your karma and do the same :)

(Unfortunately, that was literally the only thing that made me happy today ':D)"
"I‚Äôm expecting my second daughter. Despite seeing her on ultrasounds twice already I heard her heartbeat for the first time today! 

And my first daughter (14 months) and I sat in her baby pool today and had so much fun, even tho it‚Äôs hot and miserable out!"
I spent a nice day with my daughter down by the river before we have to take her to hospital tomorrow
It‚Äôs small but I got a new villager in Animal Crossing named Tucker! He‚Äôs the only elephant villager with tusks and he‚Äôs a wooly mammoth!
"It‚Äôs gonna sound like nothing, but my stomach has been hurting  all day, I let one rip about 10 minutes ago and oh my days, the release was so sweet. 

All the pain and discomfort ...gone, by far the longest one I‚Äôve ever had too ü§ô"
We're changing security system providers and the old one gave me no hassle whatsoever about cancelling.
Rolled over this morning to see my beautiful partners smiling face. Just in time to be farted on by my 3 month old puppy.
My baby sister gave me a kiss on my cheek on her own for the first time, with no prompting. It was so cute^^
I work overnight and got out of work an hour earlier today, and spent my morning with my significant other just making a run to starbucks and playing our favorite videogames together before he had to go into work! It makes me happy to have that little bit of time between our shifts to spend together! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
this little kid in my neighborhood whom i hadnt seen in months because of me having to go take care of my stroke ridden mother, and a couple of his little buddies came running over to me when i was smoking a cig and said, 'hey! remember me?!? long time, no see stranger! how ya been!? ive been dying to show you the new tricks i learned on my bike!' it made my whole week tbh.
For once in five months I just felt happy! I just felt like I've had a really rough patch these past few months, I lost weight cuz I was feeling anxious and depressed and I took the time to relax the past month and forget about everything that's really stressing me and let go, and I just can't explain the joy in this achievement.
"I‚Äôm back working at the pub six days a week now and I work late afternoon and finish late at night usually, and my boyfriend starts early morning and finishes late afternoon, so we only get a tiny bit of time in between if at all to see each other. Cause I sleep in in the morning too so I‚Äôm only up for a quick goodbye, and he‚Äôs asleep by the time I get home so I just give him a little hug.

Today we would‚Äôve had a little time together but he had to stay back, so just as he was getting home I was leaving, so he decided instead of going home to meet me at the lights and walk me to work. I was so happy to spend my walk to work with him, and after he‚Äôd had a long tiring day at work, and done his hour walk home already, he kept going just so he could spend a little time with me!

Really made my night :)"
I managed to fix and optimize a nuclear reactor in Gecko which will now not only stop polluting water but will also produce excess electricity which they can provide to Vault City in exchange for medical supplies.
Today I woke up before my husband and just listened to his soft snore . I know it sounds silly but I love that sound. I think he sensed me awake as he wrapped his arms around me and pulled me in for a snuggle. It's definitely a good way to spend the morning xx
My friend who has been depressed for the last 6 months, and I haven't seen for that last four, texted me back today and we went for a walk.
"I had an oral exam via Zoom. 

I was supposed to go abroad this semester - that didn't happen, and when I finally got registered for the courses at my own university, myself and the other not-abroad-goers were two months behind. The semester was almost already at an end.

I have been so stressed. I read slowly, so normally I need the entire semester just to keep up. I've had to rush a lot of things, and I since I really like to perform well, this isn't good for me. 

Today I had the my first exam. I had made a presentation on a somewhat abstract topic that I have had some difficulties to explain to others. I simply found it very interesting, and it's something that I'll be writing about in my bachelor work next semester too. 

The exam was in German, which is my third language. There was a content-grade and a language-grade. For my content I got the second-best grade in our system, and the third best in the language part. 

As I got back from the Zoom breakout-room, believe I heard my teacher say the line ""einer der kreativsten.."" (one of the most creative... someting) before I hurriedly asked if I had gotten back too soon - I thought they were still deciding my grade. My personal language - and that goes for any language - is often a bit weird. That was a large part of the critique too. He also spoke of high potential.

So even though I didn't get top grades, they were still very good - and somehow the creative part makes me really happy.

When I cooked myself dinner after waking up almost midnight from a nap which I thought I should take after coming back from work. on a usual day I might've slept without dinner.
My girlfriend asked me to send her a song I've been working on so she can listen to it in her car. It's not done yet but she really loves this one. That made me so happy and gave me inspiration to keep working on it.
My best friends moved away 4 months ago and I picked them up from the airport last night. Today we got breakfast at our favorite spot and we‚Äôve just been hanging out by the pool all day like the good old days and I am so happy.
My mom is here visiting from California, I got to make breakfast for her and just chat, it was nice. Then she took my three kids out so I have the house to myself, and its silent. I feel like this is the first time my house has been silent since quarantine started. Its really really peaceful.
Nothing stands out today, neither as good nor bad. I think i did well enough on a test, so i guess there's that(results aren't in until tomorrow, it's a weekly test, so it's relatively boring) didn't work today so that couldn't yield anything exciting. I'm currently in a more or less boring loop with fun things occasionally sprinkled in. I'm okay with it for now but to break it I'd first have to figure out *what* to break it with.
My beautiful niece was born yesterday. She and mom are happy and healthy. I can not wait to meet her. First time uncle üôÇ
