"People who ask for help on everything and don't even try to figure it out for themselves

-my mom still can't work the remote"
"Hitting my head. I feel like I turn into a caveman if I hit my head on something. It doesn't even need to hurt that bad, but it sets me off. Anywhere else on my body, I might rub it and say ""owies,"" but my head? I'll become unintelligible and start swinging. 

edit: Apparently this is pretty common! Does anybody know why this happens?"
"Zero tolerance rule in High School and Colleges. One of the various examples where a victim was suspended for getting beat up. 

A girl was eating her lunch when two girl's jumped her. One girl took her by the hair and smashed her face into the table. Her nose at this point is pretty messed up. The second girl is behind the first girl and waits for the victim to fall down and stomps on victims face. All three girls were suspended for a week. Victim didn't even lay a finger on anyone. Fuck zero tolerance rule. 
"
"The rule in most schools now : If you defend yourself when the other person throws a punch, you will be suspended for fighting. 
The logic behind this bothers me to no end."
People who stop to look at a wreck in traffic. Especially if it is on the other side of a divided highway or off on an access road. 
People who are so goddamn dramatic and whiny on Facebook.  I know, to most, it shouldn't be a big deal but it drives me nuts
"While driving, people who pass you and then immediately slow down so that YOU then have to pass them. As soon as you pass them, they get all pissed because they just passed you and they don't want you passing them so they speed up to make you look like an asshole. I'M SORRY THAT TEN MILES OVER THE SPEED LIMIT IS NOT FAST ENOUGH FOR YOU! Asshole Maine drivers. 

Sorry for the rant, rough drive to work this morning. 

TL;DR - people who pass you to only slow down. "
People who have side conversations during a lecture, holy shit just shut up for 50 minutes and then go on with your life
"Whenever I hear about someone proposing at someone else's wedding I just go apeshit. This just seems like the ultimate douche move and I have let it be known that if it happens at my wedding I will step in, end the proposal, and ask them both to leave.

Edit for clarity: I have never personally experienced this so I' not quite sure why I'm so passionate about it. I am not married yet, but I have a very serious bf, and we both know we're going to get married. We just don't want to get engaged until we can afford to set the date."
"Double standards.

Nothing makes me want to punch something quite as hard and quite as fast as a hypocrite."
"Attention seekers. A friend woke me up at 2am telling me that he is a terrible friend and i should just forget him. At the time we went the same school and saw eachother everyday. After asking him what the fuck it was about, he said something like "" well cya tomorrow :) "". He woke me up at 2am for that. 

Edit: He is a good friend but he just fixes to be the center of attention all the time, it gets annoying."
"People who neglect/abuse their children. Why the fuck do have kids if you don't want to love them? Tons of people can't even have children. Go give them to someone who will love them and go be a piece of shit somewhere else. 

Edit: Okay guys, I get it. Group homes and orphanages aren't much better. They are a hell of a lot better than staying with your parents and getting starved and/or beaten! "
"I've said it before and I'll say it again...Fresh socks + even a drop of liquid = day is ruined. Instantly. Bonus points if you do not know what exactly you stepped in. (I have 3 kids, this stuff is a mystery sometimes)"
"The anti-vaccination movement. These scumbags prey on people who are emotionally vulnerable and trying to do the best for their child by convincing them to put both their child and other people's children at risk.

Part of me hopes there is a hell, simply so Andrew Wakefield will burn there."
People who make fun of people working out. Do not make fun of the fat guy/girl out for a jog or going to the gym. They are trying to better themselves. The subhuman scum who shame them or giggle and whisper while they struggle to improve themselves are a detriment to society. 
"When someone tells me to ""calm down"" or to ""just relax"". Or when having a discussion or disagreement with someone and they walk away mumbling. Say something to me, or don't. But don't fucking be all passive aggressive with the volume of your voice and try to bait me into an argument. I'm a pretty laid back guy, but that shit just enrages me. 

Oh, also when I open a pack of Gushers and they're *all* red. The first time it was kind of cool, like a crazy confectionery coincidence. But then it kept happening and now it just fucking pisses me off. I like other flavours too, Mrs. Betty Crocker. "
"<Insert Picture>

When I am working with someone and they don't pull their weight meaning that I have to do some of their work too. Dammit, I ain't earning part of your paycheck for you!
"People showing off! Great you have a talent, stop shoving it down everyone's throat! 
There's a girl in my grade who is a great singer, but she literally never stops singing...in chemistry?Let's sing! Walking to school? Let's sing! People tell me to stop singing? LETS FUCKING SING! "
When people discover I am colour blind the instantly point to something and ask me what colour it is. My typical response is beige...
When I tell someone something that I KNOW is right, and they say it isnt, usually in a snotty tone, if they show me that what I was saying was wrong and explain it, thats fine.  But if they just keep saying no it isnt, or if they back it up with total crap..it pisses me off instantly
"People who boast about having never read a book.

People who criticise me when I use a word they don't know or when I pronounce a foreign word as it's supposed to be.

People who criticise others for wanting to better themselves with education.

And finding out post-dump there's no bastard toilet paper in the public shitter."
Anything that involves child neglect and/or sexual abuse. Sexual crimes against children are terrible. The fact that you could do that to a child is beyond sickening.
The thought of other dudes trying to flirt with my girl. My crippling insecurity doesn't really help either.
"Seriously, people who are judgemental about mental illness. 

As someone who has had a history of it, a father with schizophrenia and many friends who have had their own problems in the past, it enrages me when I hear someone be dismissive or mocking when mental illnesses are mentioned. 

I also get particularly mad when people feel it necessary (including people who are very aware of what the struggle she is constantly going through) to tell my anorexic friend that she looks 'disgusting'. Seriously? How the fuck could someone think that's acceptable?"
Sexual abuse, in any variety, immediately infuriates me.  Real anger.  I'm not talking about being rough with a partner, I'm talking about ABUSE.  Even now I'm getting angry thinking about it.  The idea of it, even on screen, bothers the fuck out of me.
"Facebook ""friends"" (90% of my Facebook friends re my gullible family) linking every thing they find on Facebook and believing it is 100% true.  NO this IS NOT the first time in 875 years a month has had five Fridays!!!!"
"When somebody uses their ""bad"" childhood as an excuse to be a complete fuckhead as an adult. No you just chose to be this way and found what you feel is a viable excuse. You are really just a fuckhead.

I've seen and experienced some horrible shit growing up, however I understand 2 things, someone somewhere had it worse than me and I can't change what happened, I can only make the future better for myself."
People pushing on to public transport before the people trying to get off can actually get off. It doesn't help that I see this consistantly every day before and after work.
"Slow drivers in the left lane that refuse to move over. 
Or, drivers that absentmindedly careen across five lanes of traffic. "
"Ryan Holle's situation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Holle

This man is in jail, serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole, for lending his car to a friend, the friend took the car and committed crimes (including a murder) at a place the car took them too, beyond ridiculous, this man should not be in jail. 

He might have known they were going to burgle but he did not know about the murder and who knows his situation for saying yes, maybe wrong but the punishment he got was unjust. "
"When people say I ""talk white"" or ""act white"" because I'm black, I enunciate my words, and I don't only listen to rap music. "
I am a very generous person with my time for people or causes I want to help, but if I'm going out of my way for you don't you dare waste my time
"Having to walk/ride with a bike with a strong wind that blows in your face and is like: 

""Fuck you, Passenger."""
"People who try to get my attention by shouting my name and get angry when I don't respond when...

1. I am on another floor of the house.
2. I am in another room of the house.
3. The door is closed.
4. I have headphones in.
5. The vacuum is on. 
6. I am on the phone.

This in any combination is absolutely infuriating to me. Bonus rage when they are completely oblivious to the fact that I don't perpetually exist in a state of ""waiting for people to call my name."" My life is not a doctor's waiting room. I am not actively waiting for you to call me. I am doing the dishes with my headphones in and you are downstairs doing the vacuuming.

*I can't fuckin' hear you.*"
People who are mean just because they can be. Even if you don't like someone, no need to be horrible to them, just avoid them.
Last night I went on a walk and saw at least 12 houses with Christmas decorations up. That ticked me off. 
People who leave their shopping cart in the middle of the aisle making it impossible for carts to pass in either direction.
Anyone who comes up to me and gets all the fuck up in my space trying to look at my computer screen. It really tops it off when that piece of shit starts mouth breathing/laughing and inadvertently spits on me. 
People in the left lanes of any road when they have no business being anywhere but the rightmost lane.  (Reverse left and right if your country drives weird.)
Whenever I hear or read about animal abuse. My blood instantly boils and I want to tear the abusers apart with my bare hands. 
People who moan about their financial state, but happily buy weed and takeout multiple times a week. DERP.
"Couple of things:

1. When I see a pregnant woman smoking/drugging/drinking. ""It's my body, my choice."" NOT WHEN THERE'S ANOTHER HUMAN LIVING INSIDE YOU!! If smoking/drinking is that important to you, get an abortion.

2. When black people (I'm black) claim that foreign-born Arabs/Indians/Asians get 7 years of tax-free beenfits when they come to urban american neighborhoods to open up gas stations/corner stores/Chinese restaurants/beauty supply stores. Then black people use this as an excuse to cuss them out/be disrespectful/steal from them. NO THEY DON'T GET 7 YEARS TAX-FREE!!!"
Pearl Jam. My whore mother cheated on my dad with this fucking douche bag who loved pearl jam, and she started listening to them a lot while it was going on, but before anyone knew what was up. I will forever associate that annoying voice with his face, and it never fails to raise my blood pressure. Fuck, now I'm pissed just hacing talked about it. Fucking whore.
"people who claim metal is talentless screaming. 

also people who think I worship satan because I like distorted guitars and blast beats.
"
"I'm usually a very calm and patient kinda guy. I consider myself better than to rage at people but if you knock off my glasses I WILL KNOCK OUT YOUR TEETH.
I'm not sure why but it really really ticks me the hell off. As in, I have a rage black out. I will admit... I beat the shit out of a girl when I was like 5-6 cause she smacked me during play and knocked my glasses off. 
Yes I am ashamed of that today.

Note: I am 31 today and been wearing glasses since I was 10 months old."
Every time a see tax money being stolen by the politicians in my country. It just makes me want to blow their asses up with a C4. The worst part is that they do it and never get punished, even after being judged AND COMDEMNED. It's impossible not to hate these brazilian politicians.
Those who have a poor work ethic, and use government programs instead of taking care of themselves. -- The ones who abuse the system. 
"Ghetto Sass.  
You wanna make me instantly hate you, lose all respect for you as a person, and find you incredibly unintelligent all at the same time? Just turn on that sass."
When a piece of poop gets stuck in your butt hair, and you try to separate your butt hair like a curtain, but then the piece of poop just stays there and you can't get it out, and then someone walks into the bathroom and you're squatting over the urinal doing this, and you ask for some help, just a spotter to help you get that piece of poop out of your butt hair, but they don't even try to help you.  That makes me instantly angry.
People smoking in a car with children inside. I'm all for wrecking your own health, but not your kids'.
"People who say that they have OCD when they really don't have OCD. I don't even have it myself but they still bug the shit out of me.

""OMG guis, im lyk so ocd. all of my pens need to be in rainbow order or ill lyk scream."""
Story toppers and exaggerators. If you have to exaggerate your story to make it interesting, you shouldn't have opened your stupid, lying mouth in the first place.
"Book banning and burning!

People who are proud of not reading!

Being call weird for reading so much!"
"- Racism.
- Homophobia.
- Worship of thuggery and pop culture / Mockery of education and intelligence
- People who pour coffee or soda out their car windows onto the road
- Chewing with your mouth open.
- Not waiting until I finish my sentence to speak up. Not listening in general
- Saying, ""I don't read""
- Being late for scheduled events, meetings, appointments.
- Bad public transit etiquette. Get out of the fucking doorway on the el!"
"as someone who deals with depression and anger issues at times, any time someone says "" it can only get better from here"" or anything like that bothers me immensly, they dont understand what its like and dont seem to try. "
"Homework.

If you actually do your homework, that leaves you with less time to sleep, so you sometimes fall asleep in your classes. When you fall asleep in class, you miss the lesson and have to stay after, not to mention the annoying lectures about getting enough sleep. But that takes away from your time for extra-curricular activities, which teachers so often urge you to do. Which in turn gets you in trouble with those in charge of said extra-curricular activities.

However if you actually try to get the right amount of sleep, then when does your homework get done? Then you get in trouble with your teachers, have to stay after or get some sort of punishment. That takes time away from extra-curricular activities, and you get in trouble again.

Coming from someone who's average school day is as long or longer than the average work day, homework is the root of all problems in school. At least for most people I know."
"People who compare having a pet to having a child...are you serious!

People who don't put their kids in seatbelts or carseats, considering its illegal I see it all the damn time.

Fruit flies, I don't know why but those things piss me off more than they should. 


*edited for spelling (sorry)"
"Almost everything :/

Internet disconnections.

Headphone wire stuck under chair.

When people discuss religion.

Homophobes.

Slow loading or various things.

Loud eating.

When you have to press a button on your lighter more than once to get result.

Reddit clichés.

People who stutter. I mean no offense, I'm referring to people who don't have a medical stutter, but do it anyway.

People who call me ""mate"" when I don't know them.

Women abuse.

People who don't stop their cars at a zebra crossing.

Painting (doing it now, on a break, it sucks.).


That's all I can think of for now. Back to work.

"Cellphones in restaurants.
If you're too busy talking on your phone to acknowledge your server, you shouldn't be there. Or if you're out with your family and spending the whole meal hollering into your phone, nope."
"When you are bashing a bad movie like Transformers and someone says ""Ew, you are such a movie critic."" So apparently to some, having the most basic knowledge of film to understand the difference between a good and bad movie, automatically makes you a critic. Fuck this irritates me!"
"People who think they are cool because they listen to a certain type of music. ""I'm a skinny white nerd, but I listen to some obscure band so im better than everyone else"". That, and hipsters. Hipsters make me mad as a cut snake..
You picked out the ugliest outfit you could find, just to look different, but now you just look like all the other douches who are trying to pretend they aren't trying to be hipsters..."
Being hit in the head. I'm not talking about being in a fight, I mean any type of contact,  someone at work walks by and taps me with a few papers in a friendly way, I'm instantly pissed off,  I can goof around and play in any other way,  verbal insults do nothing,  punch me in the arm,  I'm fine,  but you fucking touch my head in some way...  I get pissed.
"People who brag about not knowing how to cook. It's just sad. Don't get me wrong - lots of people don't learn how to cook for various reasons, and that's a problem. But I'm talking about the people who are all ""Oh man, I can't even boil water, I'm SO bad at cooking, isn't that awesome?"""
"Didn't see it so here's mine:

Biting your lip or the inside of your cheek. Makes me see red instantly.
The fact that the subsequent swelling makes it EASIER to do it again doesn't help."
When someone throws a cigarette butt out their window.  I really want to pick it up and throw it back in their window.
"people painting their toenails inside a car.

no, putting the window down does not make it better, everyone still hates you."
When my wife enters the bathroom while I'm pooping. We have a studio-type apartment, and our bathroom just has a curtain for a door. 
Debates about gay rights. God dammit people, can't we just all treat everyone equally and respectfully?
"Traffic. Oblivious people who drive slow in the fast lane. People who drive on the shoulder and cut into the front of the turn/exit lane. People who don't scoot up to allow someone past them at the front of the light. People who stop at imaginary stop signs when they have the right of way. 

Over the weekend, there was a cop to the side trying to turn left onto a busy intersection from a stop sign. The douche bag in front of me stops completely to let the cop turn, but he still had to wait for a gap in oncoming traffic to make his turn. So we sat behind this idiot for two minutes while waiting for the cop to turn. We had no stop sign, no red light, no nothing, except for a cop with his turn signal sitting at a stop sign on the side street. Infuriating."
"Accidentally yanking my headphones out of my ears. Especially when it happens *repeatedly*

**twitch**"
Don't fucking tell me how to raise my dog. I don't care what the big flat screen in your living room tells you, I know how to be an alpha to my dog. 
People smoking in crowded areas. Regardless of being outside where it's allowed, I think it's just common courtesy to not smoke in a crowd of non-smokers. I used to work in our down town area and lunch time and quitting time absolutely sucked because there are random smokers in every group of people.
"When you are talking to someone and they start texting somebody and  completely stop listening to you.

Even worse when they are snapchatting-- how do they not know they look like a fucking moron?"
"Extreme right or extreme left people talking about politics.  

Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but it irritates the shit out of me when someone thinks that anyone who doesn't wholeheartedly agree with their point of view is totally wrong.  "
"When I'm having a calm argumentative discussion with someone, and some other chap comes in like, ""um yeah, let's change the subject!""

The fact that people have different opinions is a *good thing*. Arguing is also good. It's a learning experience. I'm not trying to be hostile, I just enjoy debating. For me, debate is kind of a celebration of difference of opinion. "
People who refuse or are unable to use critical thinking skills and yet feel their point of view deserves to be not only heard, but should be essentially made into law.
People who drive slow in the left lane when there isn't a car in the lane to the right. FUCK YOU GET THE FUCK OVER DICK FUCK.
"People who claim that being homosexual is a choice. My response is ""I'm attracted to women, but I can't remember a time when I had to *decide* that...at what point did you decide that you preferred vagina to penis?"""
"When someone refuses to try something on the grounds that ""they don't like it"".  How do you know if you dont like something if you dont fucking try it first!?
"
"People who use the word ""retard"" or ""retarded"". Like, I get that at one point that was an appropriate way to refer to people with mental handicaps - but that time is not now, and calling a video game or a politician you don't like ""retarded"" makes me want to punch you in the mouth. "
Drivers who don't turn their headlights on in the dusk/evening time. I run after work a lot and seeing this just irks me.  
"""get's"", ""their"" instead of ""they're"" and vice versa, ""your"" instead of ""you're"" and so on. Don't destroy your fucking language. 

Oh, and putting apostrophes before ""s"" in plural's- like this. "
"When people act like poverty is a result of some kind of moral failing. 

 I know far too many awesome, hardworking people who struggle to make ends meet and people telling me how the poor are lazy or stupid will send me right over the edge. "
"*Genetics*

My 96 year old grandmother has 20/20 vision and all of her original teeth. I was born with rotten teeth (calcium deficiency in utero, came in falling apart) and I'm legally blind at the age of 28. "
When I KNOW I'm screwed, but everyone just has to TELL me that I'm screwed. I don't know why, it just pisses me off so much.
"Joan Lunden's ""A Place for Mom"" commercials.  She's so fucking chipper about putting 'Mom' in a home.  And what about Dad, huh?!  

WHAT.  ABOUT.  DAD?!?!?!"
"When the dog licks himself loudly for five minutes straight.

Spock, I love you, but I WILL murder you."
"Speeders/hooners/racers/peel-outs/ asshole drivers in general.

Overtaking me on the highway doing 20-30km over the speed limit t get in front of me, then slow down and do 10 under.

Then puts pedal-to-the-metal in first gear and reclines around a suburban T-intersection while flipping the bird to everyone, while everyone else is wondering what the fuck his problem is.

EDIT: btw I'm a P-plater and I have never crashed, never sped, not any of that shit so I have the right to complain."
People who write checks at the check out counter. I know it's irrational but  c'mon use a debit card... 
Hearing my stepson complain about absence of Wi-Fi in certain places or Wi-Fi that is too slow.  He's 12 and it makes me cringe because when I was 12 I was using dial-up through Prodigy at a whopping 2.4 kbps.  He doesn't know how good he has it. 
People texting and driving. With their kids in the car more so. Your text can fucking wait, put the safety of your children/other people on the road first you self centered fuck. Makes me livid.
"When someone asks you if you're okay and or when someone tells you to calm down.  
^Inb4 someone tells me to calm down or asks me if I'm okay."
"Bicyclists. They go thirty under the speed limit, never give enough room to pass, run every red light, and to top it off they have this smug nose in the air attitude of ""Im better than everyone because I'm being environmentally friendly while everyone else is a car driving polluting asshole."" And don't get me started on their skin tight outfits with all their bogus sponsors.

When people smoke in the presence of children, i don't care if it's your life choice, but it's not theirs and they're certainly not in a position to make that choice. FUCK.
"All this talk about social classes and the wealthy elite and the 1%. Its pretty inane to bitch that there are super-rich people and claim they need their wealth and assets distributed or whatever. There will always be stupidly rich people. They arent required to share with the rest of us. Forcing them to give up their property for the sake of the many pretty much shows that humans will abandon property rights when they decide they interfere with their agenda. That's a slipperly slope.

Social Justice. The term is the polite way of saying ""Telling other people how to live their lives.""

People who get angry at swear words. Words are words. If you are so easily frightened that a single simple noise I make with my mouth is enough to put your back up, you may wish to remain indoors forever in a room full of bright and cuddly toys, as you are essentially a baby."

When guys get sent to jail for rape, and later we find out the girl was just joking, and they give her one month. THE RAGE.
People who talk on a cell phone while driving. Can't stress enough how clueless you are in your surrounding when you do this. HANG THE GOD DAMN PHONE UP AND DRIVE!!! There, I feel better. 
Obvious logical fallacies. Seriously, most of these should be intuitive, and they get thrown around (particularly on the internet) like they're going out of style. 
Getting bitched at. Nothing pisses me off more then someone thinking they need to bitch instead of working with someone to reach a solution.
Nosy people. Also, when people don't know anything of what they're talking about but try to interject and say the dumbest thing, and then get mad when you correct them and tell them they're wrong.
"1. People who pretend to like things that they know nothing about.

2. People at parties who come in at the end of a joke I'm telling and say something incredibly witty that reduces the impact of what I said.

Whenever I think of my childhood and my inability to speak up about getting bullied or to do anything about it. And as a result, I suffered with severe depression and two failed suicide attempts. Now I'm fine, but it still makes me angry.

Same shit with people judging me about liking Pokemon or Screamo.

When you are listening to music with headphones and you reach down quickly or snag the cord on a door knob or something and it rips them out of your ears. Instant irrational rage.
People who drive the speed limit in the passing lane!! If you're not passing anyone this lane's not for you.
The fact that some people are judged for certain things that they have no control over, such as race or nationality. 
Blatant, ignorant and selfish stupidity, like when someone is doing it on purpose and doesn't care about hurting others, especially when they KNOW they are doing bad things but still continue.
"The movie ""Wanted"", with Angelina Jolee, Morgan Freeman, and that one dude nobody remembers.  The impossible bullet curving just pisses me off."

ignorance. whether it's from someone's piss poor driving on the interstate or whenever a republican opens their mouth, it just makes me want to sterilize them to keep their bullshit from spreading to future generations.

Apologies that are really just people making excuses for their behavior without taking responsibility. 
Anytime I read about how X thing in society (video games/bad language/too much sex on TV) is leading to Y outcome. I don't believe it, even if it was true I don't give a shit- quit trying to push your medieval Christian values on me and go back to watching American Idol. 
cyclists riding in the middle of a busy road when there is either a bike lane or an extra wide sidewalk designed for bicycles. If you get hit by a car... you deserve it for being an asshole
Having my earbuds pulled out. Like getting them caught on a door handle or something and having them yanked right out of my ears. Automatic hardcore rage.

"People who try to make their own preferences (usually about trivial things) look like the objective, right thing to do.

You put ham first and cheese on top, when making a sandwhich? Nah, cheese should go first, *it makes more sense*.

So this will likely get buried and it's been rage inducing for me since I was a kid, but people who take photographs of the dead at funerals and wakes.  It really seems disrespectful to me, especially if/when the family has requested No Photos.

Shitty parents. It sounds like a crazy stance but after all the stories I've heard and things I've seen, there's no question in my mind that having children should be a privilege, not a right. You need a background check to own a gun because in your hands that gun could hurt somebody, but just about anyone can have offspring and abuse them behind closed doors, or in public in some countries and no one will question their ability to raise a child until it's often too late. I hate guns but I'd rather be shot in the face than systematically abused my whole life by people that are supposed to love me.

"Two years ago I was working at a Sam's Club in Maryland selling phones during the holiday season. I was standing out front in the snow handing out fliers to people coming in saying ""Happy Holidays"" to each one (I'm an atheist but wanted to respect others despite my normal ""ba-humbugness"").  This one asshole rips the flyer from my hand and says ""What the fuck are you talking about?  There's only one holiday that I know of when our savior was born.""  I have never ever wanted to just eliminate somebody from the gene pool right then and there in my entire life.

-Uneducated, poor, white people who vote Republican straight ticket. You're voting against yourselves, assholes.  
-Southern football fans who think they invented football.  
-People in the drive through who make large, complicated orders. Listen, asshole: the drive through is for quick convenience. If you want a big, complicated order, park your car, get your fat ass out of it and go inside.  
-When you call customer service and they put you on hold, then when you get a representative, s/he will say you're in the wrong department and transfer you. Nowadays I just stop paying my bill and wait for them to trip over themselves to get hold of me.

People who have no to little control of their children. Also people who hand their kid a smart phone to shut them up. Which leads to kids whining and crying because the parent will not give them the smart phone. Learn to teach your kids some manners and patience.

People who throw trash out their car windows.  The adrenaline surge boosts my pulse from a calm 80 to a raging 140 in about 2 seconds.
When people think they are country. Living in Ohio I see this very often. Some girl with cowboy boots and a truck their parents bought them that they don't use to hall anything! I'm a very judging person and I know I'm an asshole for this but you aren't country you're fake!!
Extreme couponing. A lady today bought about $700 worth of groceries and paid under $10. It's like legal theft.

Just to show you how rude he is, on the final night if their most recent production (How to Succeed in Business Without really Trying), the director had the cast come on stage after the final bow with the soon-to-be-departing seniors in front to sing one final song. This was to recognize the seniors and to see them off. He steps a little bit forward to be up closer to the audience (basically getting up with the seniors) and sings louder than the entire cast."

Fiction and reality are both beautiful. But reality has an extra pull, because people really want to know what's true, and are fascinated when they discover something in the real world they didn't know before. If they find out they've been tricked, they become disappointed and jaded. If you've created fascinating fiction, label it as such.

When the government and old people try to blame the latest thing (AKA computers) as the reason for our society problems.
i can only think of one thing that has truly made me instantly angry. Awhile back at my high school, we had some vietnam war veterans come in to speak on Veterans Day. A few hours before the assembly, i saw this hipster girl and her friends dressed up as hippies, with the whole war protest thing going. Im not particularly patriotic, but i just became instantly enraged, that they were disrepresenting these individuals, from a generation and a conflict they had no connection to.
"People who spread those bullshit chain posts on Facebook, usually about how oxygen will kill you and how (insert politician/company here) has said or done something offensive to the armed services and should be boycotted. 
It's just so mind-bendingly infuriating that in the age where everyone has easy access to the internet that people see posts like the above and share it without actually thinking for themselves. A simple Google search will always give a link to one of many sites revealing it to be a hoax. 
I now make a point of commenting with a link and politely ask people to check their facts before making damning statements about whichever topic. If people are so strongly moved by the topic why can't they at least check if it's actually true?

Kids who are loud in a public place, like a store or restaurant, and the parents make no effort to get them to stop or take them outside. That infuriates me to no end! Disrespectful to everyone else around them...
People who change lanes and do turns without using turn signals.  It is the 3rd thing you learn when you start driving. First how to turn the car on, then the gas and break, and then you learn turning and turn signals.  It is stupid easy to do,  but so many people can't seem to manage it.

"I hate it how some teachers feel like they can say anything they want to you, like make fun of you or make you look like a dumbass in class, but when you've had enough and you decide to talk back, they send you out of class and talk to you about how rude you are and how much of an ""attitude"" you have. Bitch you're the one giving me all this bullshit so why the fuck should I take it all and not say anything?

What ridicules me even more is that my classmates look down on me as if I'm a public enemy and think I talk back because I want to be ""cool"". They think that you should never talk back to a teacher no matter what, and one colleague even went as far as telling me ""But doesn't a teacher have like complete power over you?"", after that I just couldn't look at him anymore.

"Blinkers. It takes literally no effort to flip the switch.  I don't care who you are, and how much traffic (or lack thereof) there is around you.

"Printing. Printers, and therefore printing, is awful.  
I've done my fair share with IT and let me tell you this:  
Everything about the act of printing, the act of bringing something from the digital to the haptic world, one of the most unpleasant experiences in my life.  
And the source of that are printers itself, which are perhaps some of the worst machines in human history.  
Not only are they hideous, but also terribly unreliable, record-breaking expensive and have some of the worst user interfaces ever encountered.  
The only thing worse than a printer itself is printer driver software. Printer drivers with their non-OS-integrating ""design"", their (lack of) speed and their sheer size. Why would I need 400MB of printer drivers? I just want the fucking driver and *maybe* (if I have to) a goddamn software interface to clean that thing once in a while.  
  
So my tip for everyone considering to buy a home-use printer: don't.  
If you need a printer, buy a decommissioned business-use printer. They're better built, more reliable and are way easier to maintain (e.g. some have web interfaces). Also the printing costs are lower and most of them come with an Ethernet port so everyone in the house can print from whatever device they're using (although home printer do come with WiFi more and more and there are other solutions like home routers with USB).

You don't have to tell me like I'm a retarded 7-year old! I hate when people confronts me and it just makes me more uncomfortable and angry when people just don't know how to stop.

Me personally, I'm obsessed with clearing out my notifications; texts, missed calls, facebook, games, if I notice a small red bubble with a ""1"" in it, I have to click on it. When I was in college and the only notifications that I had were emails and facebook, this was fine, but now that I have a smart phone, it's simply impossible to click them all away."
News about the US government. I would just like for once for them to actually do something fucking productive and beneficial to the people rather than fuck everyone over. I'm so sick of this shit that I have been seriously considering leaving the country when I finish my masters.
"Voicemail. It's 2013. There is no fucking need for people to leave messages anymore. Caller id, texts, or email are far more effective at telling me you need me to call you back.

Every time I see my voicemail notification come on, and I know there's a message that says, ""Hey it's ____. Call me back"", I want to drive down to that person's house, hit them with the 1990's brick phone I used to carry and ask them what decade they think it is.

The belief that feminists want power over men, when in reality feminists just want equality. 
It angers me to no end how villianized the word has become. "
"Superstitions. 

Where I live, there are literally hundreds of them. What makes me annoyed is that most of them hold no remote logical explanation whatsoever."
"crying babies and screaming kids (especially if it's complaining, like ""BUT I WANT CANDYHYHYHYHYHY"" or ""BEN TOOK MY TOYYYYHYHYHYHYHYHY"" makes me wanna punch things, seriously. It's infuriating. Teenage parents."
Whenever I hear of religious parents denying their children medical care because they think they can pray their child healthy. 
"The use of the word 'blessed'. Sets me off every time I hear it. ""Got paid today. So blessed."" ""Took a giant shit. So blessed.""

You aren't blessed. You are either lucky or you worked hard for what you got.

Pushy vegans, religious people, greens supporters, anti bullying extremists... List goes on... I have no faith in humanity
"Extremely religious people really *really* get me worked up.  
Like, I understand you practice a religion and that's perfectly fine. But when I walk into the family area in a hospital and see another family praising their god for a successful heart surgery or saying ""thank you god for guiding the surgeon"", I really just want to kill someone. The only reason they made it through the surgery is because the surgeon preformed the surgery correctly and knew what they were doing.  
There are plenty of other examples I can give, like when people say god is the reason they lost weight. No, the reason you lost weight is because you actually tried to, or had a surgery. For fucks sake, actually give credit where credit is due. Don't strip yourself or others of there accomplishments.  
/rant?"
Tailgaters.  Even if they aren't doing it to me, I immediately become enraged because there is just no need for it.
when a person eating at the same table as me takes their food on the fork and BITES down ON the fork and grinds their teeth (and what enamel they have left) over the fork. It's as if they've never heard of lips before! maybe just an etiquette school will do
Ya know, I went to comment but then I started to read all of these replies and got to angry, so I had to leave. But then, I came back to leave this comment. And that's that...

When you lose your remote control and your wife starts getting all mad because the roof won't close and the bed that's in the shape of your face is getting rained on. 
When someone walks into the elevator, points at a button, and says the floor like they expect you to push the button for them even though they are half a foot from it
People who talk too loud; I mean - shout when they talk. I've been known to spontaneously punch people really hard on the nose for shouting right next to my ear. Never shout at me when we have a conversation, I will hate you forever and probably find a reason to punch you very hard in the face at some point in the future. Hard of hearing are excused. 
"People who need an explanation of everything. I'm only asking you ""what are u up to today?"" To make conversation, not to hang out"

"Anything less than the speed limit when there's no one in front of you.

Bonus points if it's in the fast lane on the highway."
On the trains/underground, when people wait until they're actually at the godamned ticket barrier to begin looking for their goddamned ticket or Oyster card. There was no fucking visual cue that you were going to need your ticket? No hint your Oyster card might come in handy?  Fuck.
When people cough. Especially my stepdad. I don't know why; it's completely irrational. But it makes me want to punch babies. 
When I hear people gossip and talk about others. You can't say it to my face? Then don't say it at all
The worst thing is watching the evening news, you usually get something that is factually incorrect and obviously bias.
When all you want to do is some simple formatting in Microsoft Word AND THEN SUDDENLY IT WONT LET YOU DO THAT ONE SINPLE FUCKING FORMATTING THING. LIKE JESUS CHRIST JUST FUCKING LET ME PUT THIS INDENT HERE. I AM NOT EVEN USING WORD AND I'M FUCKING FURIOUS I HATE YOU SO MUCH. 
"The use of the phrase ""you're so talented"". For anyone who performs for a living or has some skill that people generally think of as ""talent"". To me it implies, and I think many people believe this, that you were magically born with this ability and that you haven't worked hard for it. "
Cheap people. There's always that one guy/girl who's debit card doesn't work or doesn't have any cash on them when the bills brought to the table...yet they ordered the fuckin filet mignon.
"That Ka'a card game that they play in Big Bang Theory. It is such a ridiculous non-game. I get that they can't have the plot hinge on some really complex game that the viewers aren't familiar with but it is clearly just people throwing cards onto a pile on the table. There don't seem to be any points, any strategy or any rules of any significance.

For some reason it really bothers me that the writers didn't make some attempt to make the game at least non-trivial. The game apparently holds the attention of a bunch of very smart fairly hardcore nerds but it looks like something six year olds would rapidly get bored with."
Cutting me off while no one is ahead of me, and no one is behind me, to fucking make a left or right turn.
"Just seeing this really dumbass kid on my soccer team, he never seems to close his mouth and his front teeth are always sticking out. He also refuses to run right and when he gets excited he hops like a fucking rabbit. would love to kill the kid
( We had  14 people quit the team due to having a harsh coach, so we have freshman and other retards on a varsity soccer team.)"
People who walk around talking on their cell phone on speaker phone while holding it a foot away from their head. Just... why? WHY would you ever do this? Every time I see someone doing this I want to slap the phone out of their hand and stomp the shit out of it. If you can't figure out how to use a phone properly, you don't deserve to have one.
Chewing with your mouth open. If I can hear you crunching your food into tiny pieces so you can swallow it, I will be pissed. So pissed I enter rage mode!!! Makes me mad thinking about it.
When a customer talks on the phone at the cash register. I'm not a cashier any more but this used to drive me nuts, and it still does whenever I see it.
"When you apologize for something, then the person you're apologizing too says, ""yeah you were."" Or ""I tried telling you but I gave up."" "
"People that drink ""Fiji"" water.(here in Britain) Why ship water across the globe, from an Island in the middle of the ocean? Why pay extra to drink that water from across the globe? It doesn't taste any better, it's just a waste of resources and taking away from the limit resources they (the water) and humanity (fuel for transport) have. I'm known to go on 15 minute rage talks when I see people with it or when I see it stocked in a supermarket. ( also water that is shipped in from abroad, but not so far away, like San Pellegrino, makes me almost equally angry. You can buy bottled water that is local and it tastes just fine, but I think buying bottled water is just stupid anyway) "
"Littering... shit infuriates me. Especially when you throw your Mcdonalds bag in front of my house and my dog rips it to shreds.

Throwing something away, practically placing it IN the trash can, but you flick your wrist or the trash sticks to your hand for a second or something and to miss the can.  ARRRRGGGGG!!!  Its almost like there is an invisible force that pushes the trash out of the trash can.
People that talk during movies and then ask questions because they missed something because they were talking
Every time I hear about someone using a weapon, be it gun or knife or whatever. I just can't understand it, I would feel like the wimpiest pussy of all time if I did that. It's like you know you are less of a man versus the one you are upset with if you have to resort to a weapon.

"If someone taps on me aggressively to get my attention, if I have headphones on or am otherwise unable to hear them.

I understand you need my attention. A soft tap on the shoulder is fine, don't come down on me like you're trying to kill a bug."
Bad mental health care. It makes people who are suffering suffer more and longer. It makes people who are suffering *pay* to be emotionally abused. And there is *so much* of it.
Women being abused. However I don't know what feels worse, seeing the abuse, or seeing it and being too afraid to confront the abuser. Most people just look at it like a train wreck and just watch/ walk away. It takes a special kind of person to stand up and defend someone who has been too beaten down to do it on thier own. 
Stupid people, people that are smart but have no common sense, people who chew with their mouth open, people saying shit about how one gender should have more rights than the other, animal cruelty, and people who only see one side of an argument.
"Ok, as a military guy three things that really piss me off are:

#1 DUI - You have 30 or more people in your squadron but you still drive drunk, get caught, and make everyone go to four hours of training. 

#2 Infidel and Proud Bumper Stickers - You dicks are driving around with stickers saying you're unfaithful. What is this, the Scarlet Letter?

#3 Email - Just because you sent me an email doesn't mean I opened and understood the message! Holy fucking shit! You have a phone and know where my office is located! Be a human and interact with me!

YEEEAAAARRGH!"
"you know what really grinds my gears?

people that stop at the top/bottom of the escalator.  the escalator keeps moving even though you got off.  where would u like the rest of us to go?

having to repeat myself.  sometimes I just mumble something to myself and having to repeat something that doesn't matter or have to explain what I said to myself boils my blood.

what pisses me off is when people dont put their fuckin shopping carts back and just leave them beside other peoples cars or in parking spots. ooooh and another one is when people dont pick up their dogs shit.
Being spoken to when I'm on the phone with someone else. IT CAN WAIT. YOU CAN CALL THE PERSON I'M SPEAKING TO WHEN I'M DONE SPEAKING WITH THEM.
"When I have my signal on, and people intentionally prevent me from switching lanes. Then when I finally get pissed off and have just enough space in front of someone and I come over just in time to make my turn, and they honk at me. I want to force them off the side of the road and slam their head in the car door. 

This and when people turn or change lanes without using a signal. Why do people refuse to use/look for signals? It is such a simple thing that makes everyone's life easier.

I mean seriously, when you are turning, can you not spare the extra effort of extending the fingers on your left hand to flick the signal on in the process? You hands are already going that direction?"
Being told to smile. I can go from just concentrating on driving to considering when is the right moment to escape after driving you into a river.
"When I miss a cooking recipe.  
Seriously, I'm the chillest motherfucker usually. Cut me off on the road ? Move along, sir, and have a nice day. Full, noisy, stinky train to go to work ? Eh, I'll just listen to some music. Horrible day at work ? I'll forget everything as soon as I pass the door.  
But if I miss the slightest thing when baking cookies or making a pie ? I'll go fucking berserk and scream like an animal for 10 good minutes.  "
Seeing the girl I care about very deeply getting back together with the guy who has hurt her so many times before.
Wet handles. It grosses me the fuck out and I spend the next couple hours running through all the disgusting possibilities of what the 'wetness' could have been. Ew. 
Piss on the toilet seat at work (or anywhere really)... I mean, seriously, you can lift the seat with your foot in about 1 second if you're scared to touch it with your hand... pissing into the toilet with the seat down makes you an asshole. 
When something stops working slightly due to use. It makes me want to smash it into fine dust because it is falling apart. Not a good solution
Unnecessarily loud exhaust in vehicles and motorcycles. Also trucks that spew out diesel smoke as they peel out from red light to red light. I wish that shit would be piped into their truck, or motorcycles had to listen to their obnoxious noise. That's just poor engine design if it relies on exhaust back pressure to function normally.
Whenever you are waiting in line to order something and the people in front of you wait until they get to the front to even begin to decide what they want.
People who decide to hold the door open for you when your 50 feet away. Seriously?? You are not doing me a favor. You are stressing me out by making me catch up. And I feel obligated to say thank you even though I'm raging inside. 
Being spit on or at. Like i dont care if we are having a horribly heated fight. You spit at me you damn well better be prepared for a black eye and bloody nose. I rather be hit than spat at honestly. Just pisses me off to no end
"The sounds of children.
Cashiers commenting on the items I am purchasing, slowing down the transaction.
People who drift in/out while making a two-lane left turn."
Biting the inside of my lip/cheek. It swells up and then I bite it again. Each time the rage builds until I'm finally ready to never eat again until it goes the fuck away.

"Commercials.

I'm used to downloading what I want to view. Going to somebody's place and watching TV just makes me see red when commercials come on. I can't stand them. "
"The anti anti-retroviral movement. Ie: people who believe that anti-retroviral medication for HIV is a bad thing. Because of a Health Minister in South Africa having this stance, anti-retroviral medication was not used (except for the west cape). Because of *this*, it is estimated that over 343,000 people died between 1999 and 2007. A different study suggests that between 2000 and 2005 over 330,000 people died unnecessarily, 2.2 million person years were lost and around 35,000 babies were born with HIV. [source: 'Bad Science' by Ben Goldcare, chapter 10]
 Why, you may ask, did the Health Minister (Tshabalala-Mismang) believe this, and did she offer any alternative?
 It is most likely that it was people like Matthias Rath who convinced her (and many other people) that this was the case. She said that she claims that ""Raw Garlic and skin of the lemon...protect you from the disease"".
 When I read that chapter, I literally had t put down the book to calm myself down. In this thread, people talk about the anti-vaccination movement as being extremely aggravating. They (the anti-vaccination proposers) aren't even half as bad as these people in their stupidity and in the consequences of their actions.
 tl;dr: anti anti-retroviral and AIDs dissidents.

When people ignore science and factual information in general, especially for religious reasons. For example being a creationist makes absolutly no sense, it's like saying gravity is a myth 
Girls that dumb themselves down for attention. Good god, if I had a dollar for every girl I could tell could be (or come off as) really smart/intelligent if they chose to be, and then choose not to in fear of being seen as a nerd or seen unfavorably, I'd be Bill fucking Gates. Do girls realize that acting stupid/unintelligent is not attractive whatsoever?

"Seeing someone throw a cigarette butt out of their car window. 

In those cases, I think it should be perfectly legal to hit them, and they should have to pay for the damage.

any time I see someone litter it annoys me, but for some reason, watching a cigarette fly from a car induces rage."
"When a car is parked out front of a strip of stores or supermarket.

People who neglect their pets.  If you ignore your dog and think keeping it locked up in a cage for 6-10 hours a day is how you 'take care'  of your pet.  Then you don't deserve to own one in the first place. 
"Rude people in movie theaters. This includes:

People talking during the movie

"You know when you ask someone ""do you want (blank), or (blank)?""  And they say ""I don't care."" That drives me nuts "
People who don't try to cover their sneeze. I know it's a natural bodily function, but I mean damn, put some effort into containing that shit. Nasty ass.
Seeing anybody being cruel or abusive to children, animals, the elderly, or anybody else.  Bullies in general.   It ignites a slow cold burn in my solar plexus that ignites into a full blown rage if I don't control myself. 
"When people call my name, I scream ""what?!?!?!"" Then they ask me to come to them, only to ask me a question I could've answered from where I was. Gets my goat."
"When people stop to talk in the middle of a doorway/entrance/exit/in front of elevator doors/bottom of stairs/end of escalator.  

The fact they are so self centered that this behavior is deemed acceptable is infuriating.   I can't imagine what hell they put others in their lives (*for example, coworkers*) with their self centered nature. "
People trying to get onto the elevator before I've gotten off.  Its a huge problem in Asia, not sure why.
"When people say ""It's not perfect, but it's the best we've got"" in regards to things like political systems/judiciary systems etc. A) we put this one in so we can change it and b) if you only have one system in place, of course that system is going to be 'the best we've got'. If you run a race and you're the only person, of course you will win. Stop giving me that bullshit argument.

I'm getting angry just thinking about it."
People that set the time to meet somewhere. I get there early and wait 10-20 min after the set time for them to get there
When I break something thanks to my own stupidity/carelessness. I never swear, except for those times, but those times, BAD.

Biting my lip or the inside of my mouth while chewing.  Not many things make me that angry that quick.  Makes me want to punch something really hard every single time.  I usually cuss out loud and then proceed to bang my fist on the table.  People look at me like I'm nuts.
"When people say ""Pray for all of those injured or dead"" (or pray for anything tragic in that sense) what the fuck? Did your God not cause these things to happen in the first place?"
Making fun of/berating fat people, totally cool. I get that. Doing it at a gym? Totally fucking counterproductive.

"It's really opinionated but... I hate... I despise when someone uses religion as an excuse for anything. It disgusts me to see people pull one verse out of the bible and go ""See this is what the book means... God hates Homos""... They completely gloss over slavery, stoning, raping... no no its definitely the whole gay people thing. Then people who justify there lives by saying well I go to church so im a good christian... Sorry il stop here before i go on a rant."
"Whenever someone insults something of mine that I am really proud of, and then covers it with ""Oh, no offense"". Just shut up and get out. "
If I'm not even irritated (but especially if I am) and someone tells me to calm down. It's the easiest way to make me lose my shit.
When people walk down a sidewalk side by side and don't move when someone is coming the other way. I don't care if you're talking with your friend, you can move behind them for 5 seconds to let me pass and not have to walk through the mud/snow/not sidewalk.

"People making assumptions.

I hate it when people get a snippet of information and instantly form an opinion about it. It's really rampant on this site where people read a false and/or misleading headline and instantly take up their pitchforks and head for the comments section.

"Having someone in the car who freaks out everytime you change lanes, merge, drive beside a semi, through tunnels, etc. It brews in me a rage unlike anything I've ever experienced when this person does this or is constantly punching the passenger floor with their foot out of reflex becasue they think I approached the car ahead to fast. However, even more than this but still this, is when they refuse to drive but consistently tell you how to drive. We're talking raining down the fury of gods on the head of this unfortunate individual. I kicked my nephew (20 years old) out of my truck sixty miles from home for doing this very thing even after I told him to stop it. He didn't want to drive and I didn't want to hear it so get the fuck out. I've even been known to get out of my car toss the keys to the passenger and just walk away headed home. A man can only take so much bullshit.

"Hypocrites.

There is absolutely nothing worse than a person who holds a double standard on purpose. I get that we're only human and we all have some double standards, but if they're pointed out to you you should reevaluate them instead of clinging to them and making the world worse for everyone else."
How does it make sense that the government wants to raise the interest on Stusent Loans, but also want to add more schooling in prisons?! Why do they get free education while I'm here digging myself  deeper and deeper in debt with student loans. I think I'm better off robbing a bank and graduating from the University of San Quentin.

Teachers who hate children/teenagers. Here's a thought, don't choose an occupation where you're surrounded by them.
"People that think the entire room wants to hear them talk on their cell phone. It always reminds me of that Trigger Happy TV sketch of the guy with a giant cell phone screaming into it.

"People on cellphones in a checkout line who can't interrupt their conversations long enough to acknowledge the cashier.    If you are that addicted to your phone, the least you could do is say ""hold on a minute"", get your transaction done and move on.   Rude, rude, rude."

I get angry whenever somebody can't drive properly, even if it's a stupid tiny thing. Like sitting at a green light for a second to long. I work myself into a blind rage of fury once I realize it's a woman. 99% of the time the bad drivers are women. 1% being old people. Out of the 99%, 75% of those women are Asians with their faces pressed up against their windshield trying to see. I've furious just thinking about it..

People who bully those that struggle with depression and other emotional problems. If you've never had to deal with it, you don't know how it feels. I know I got teased for my depression, but not terribly so I can't imagine what it's like for those who got it worse. Even just the little comments I got made everything 10x harder for me. It was already hard to smile everyday, so getting made fun of for it made me want to try a lot less to get better. 
"My sister. She cannot support the children she has, and is planning on more. Just seeing her sets me off onto a rage.

Also, I want 1 more child (I have 2) she calls me selfish and pathetic because my husband and I have had a few disagreements and bump heads a bit.

So every week i find bags of chips, snacks etc. on my front lawn or blown into my garden from them being too lazy to hold on to their trash till they get home.

People who don't give up seats for extremely pregnant women on public transportation. The chances of every younger, strong-looking person on that bus or train car having a disability is quite small indeed. Offering is just the right thing to do.

People who attend an event that they know will be incredibly crowded with an SUV-sized stroller.  They block narrow aisles and ram the things into other people.  Last weekend was new york state's big sheep and wool festival, and like most knitters living in the northeast, I went.  The stroller assholes made my jaw drop.  It's incredibly selfish behavior to think you should get the right to clog up jam packed vendor buildings just because you had to bring the baby to an event that has nothing for kids that young to do, and throw little hissy fits when you're not automatically given the right of way in the crowd.

I can't stand it when soldiers and especially cadets embarasse the Army, themselves, and their uniform.

I guess it has something to do with the general aversion to passive voice we are all taught in school, but there are times when passive voice is appropriate, such as when you wish to separate an action from the person engaging in said action, because it is not the *person* who irritates you, it is the *act* that irritates you. You don't know the person. The person could be lovely. Being angry at people in this way is unhealthy."

"Customer service people making you sit and wait while they have personal conversations.  

I hate people who think personal conversations are this sacred thing where life, death, and burning babies all have to wait until they're through gossiping.

The cars behind him started honking and the guy on the sidewalk went right up to one of the cars honking and said;

""Excuse me, we're having a conversation here.  That's very rude.""

To all you slow drivers out there, the long line of cars behind you are not there because they admire your license plate. Get out of everyone's way you jackass. "
"* Taking food off my plate without asking. I have stabbed people for this. 

* Beginning to talk when I am mid sentence. Not in a ""i had just started talking and you started close to the same time"" kind of way, but in the way where if I was reading that part in quotes out loud, you started talking on the word ""close"" or later.

* Passing on the right when the left lane is open.  You're a shitty driver if you do this and I hope you blow two tires at the same time, then have to wait 6 hours for the roadside hazard people because you're also probably the kind of person who doesn't have a hazard plan, so you have to wait longer and pay a few hundred for the service. Idiot."
When someone, without asking, inserts something into my pocket or extracts something from my pocket. Typically just the gf stashing her lighter or looking for mine. Can't explain it. Rage.
People who use the self-checkout in grocery stores with only one hand because their other hand is holding a cellphone, a purse, a coffee, a wallet. *Empty that fucking cart, bag your shit and move on!*
Racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, et cetera. Just bigotry in general. Outside of that, people who don't clean up after themselves.
"Littering.
I work at a grocery store, and just yesterday somebody pulled into the parking lot just to throw an empty water bottle out their car's window and then leave. I was thoroughly pissed."
I have been unable to convince my Federal government to curb spending, and as a result my children have been born into debt.
Someone snoring while I'm trying to sleep. It doesn't even have to be loud but it slowly just drives me up the wall and I begin contemplating physical harm to the offender. 
The people who condemn from ignorance and hypocrites. If darth Sidious was in the same room as me a a few people who attend the Westboro Baptist church, I would have lost it and joined the dark side.
Littering. Cigarettes are the most common thing you will witness someone litter, as if it doesn't occur to them that the cigarette is trash and they are just throwing trash on the ground. Makes me rage like nothing else. 
"It makes me crazy when I invite someone over for a party or try to make plans with them & they just don't bother to respond. No ""Sorry I won't be able to make it"" or ""Maybe next time"", they just don't answer at all. I hate being ignored like that, it's so rude. I have a couple of friends that do this so I stopped inviting them to anything. Douchbags."
"When I'm slacking off at work and my manager asks me, ""What are you doing?""
Minding my own fucking business, what are YOU doing? "
I can be in the best mood in the world.  I may have just won the lottery for millions but if I see a damn cute kitten that shit gets me so fucking angry!
"People who litter on purpose. When they're just walking and throw shit on the ground. It makes me so mad. I usually pick it up, run up to them and put it in their pockets, which freaks them out big time lol. Other times I just pick it up and throw it away. These are the same people that justify their behavior by saying 'I'm creating jobs for people!"" FUCK YOU."
"any kind of animal abuse.

and cruel people in general, and i used to work retail so i've had to be very, very, very nice to some people who i really just wanted to behead.

^^^please ^^^be ^^^nice"
Dysfunctional technology. I paid for overpriced technology to make my life easier and more efficient, not to spend 3 hours trying to synch music to a phone which just so happened to be updated with a new OS which also happens to be shit.
Any kind of news outlet on TV. They don't report facts, they report speculation, they don't cover major world events properly but they endlessly cover celebrities acting stupid. It's absolutely disgusting. 
When I try to shift while driving a manual and the stick hits something in that area (a cup, someone's bag, other crap people put in the middle between the two front seats).  I go instant rage and wants to just throw whatever is obstructing my shift out of the window..  
When you're trying to put something like a box onto a high up shelf and it goes up for a second, but then falls back down, bring back down a bunch of other stuff with it. 
"When my wife puts dishes in the sink that are still full of food, or cups that still have tea/coffee in them.
"
"Stubbing your toe. 

When I hurt any other part of my body, I don't get pissed, but when it's my toe, get out of my way "
Littering. Especially the shittiest people who unload last night's McDonald's in the middle of the fucking street.
Parents that sit on their lazy asses and scream at their kids, than complain that the kids don't listen.  How about this fuck-os get off your lazy cookie eating ass and talk to the kid.  Moreover don't expect the kid to do shit your fatass won't.  They're not your bitch, they're your kids.  The complaining they don't listen pisses me off the most.  NO SHIT THEY DON'T LISTEN THEY DON'T RESPECT YOU!  And they're right.  You're child is in the right and you're wrong.  Fix it fucktard.
"People who say ""You may have booksmarts but I have streetsmarts.""

No Jackson, you are just dumb. You got fired from Wendy's for godsakes."
"When my husband tells me to ""Calm Down"" during a fight....don't do that, just don't.
It also pisses me off when someone asks me if I'm ok after I get hurt...like don't even say a word to me or I'm flipping out. Just leave me alone and let me deal with it."
"People misusing mental illnesses.

""I'm so OCD, antisocial, bipolar, etc.""

It's so enraging and I hate anyone that does this."
"People who talk in their normal way but try to say ""mozzarella"" like they speak fluent Italian.

When I can smell someones burps especially when it's hot dog.

Al Sharpton."
When I drop something more than once. God Damnit my blood boils. I am an adult human being and I cannot hold something after the first time I dropped it??? INSTANT RAGE. I have no idea why, I have always been a very impatient person but this makes me furious to no end.
"Seeing or hearing of friends spending money I know they dont have.  Trips every other weekend,  buying the new Iphone everytime it comes out.  It drives me crazy knowing that they can be so irresponsible with money. 

I'm not saint a when it comes to banking, but shit.  

edit: word"
When you are having a conversation and a motorcycle drives by and is making a loud as fuck noise with the bike and you can no longer hear your conversation.
Some one throwing something in a tantrum. Makes my blood boil because the object thrown usually breaks, or breaks something it hits or even hurts some one.  
"People who actually believe in the medieval thought that some people are of a ""higher quality"" than others based on birth."
"Seeing the casino ""Free Shuttle"" buses coming and picking up a bunch of old people to help them waste their savings."
People in the office playing music audibly.  Some of us are trying to work (or check reddit) in peace - if I have to hear What Does The Fox Say one more time, I'll seriously consider vandalizing your desk after you leave for the day.  Just because the managers have offices / are too passive to tell you it's bothersome, doesn't mean you should keep doing it.  Stop.
Today for me it is fish neglect. Browsing reddit today shows some horrible evidence of poor goldfish treatment. It is a real animal that still needs to be cared for! You cant just throw it in a puddle and expect it to thrive.

When someone is making a left turn at an intersection and its a green light and they dont move the car up . Then it turns red and they still have not made a left turn
"Self centered drivers.
There were 2 lanes and I'm in the right lane. The road curves around a corner and suddenly there are 3 traffic cones in my lane around a pothole. Good job civil maintenance! I slow down, put on my turn signal and look to my left at the person in the car in the left lane who's a bit farther back then me, waiting for her to realize if she'd slow down for 2 seconds i can get over. She looks over at me, the traffic cones, sees I'm stuck if she doesn't let me over, and she guns it, along with the next 20 cars behind her, and then the car behind me swings out and takes the one chance I had to get out before another 20 cars also pass me by.
Fuck Georgia"
"Being questioned about my gaming knowledge (I know a lot ) and when people who try to make sense of a game or ""think"" they know anything about what there talking about it annoys me to no end ....I have to walk it off or it gets bad .  I have a problem and its not even serious ."
Braking on the highway. The only reason to brake on the highway is because some other asshole is braking, and if there was an accident it was probably caused by some asshole braking on the highway. 
"Cops who use too much unnecessary force/kill an innocent person for no provable reason and get away with it even though their is some form of visual evidence that could be used against them. 

Very detailed, but it pisses me off to no end.

"Missing an exit (or a turn) on a roadway.

Pretty much I go from calm to near deaf in rage and try my hardest not to scream at anyone in the car.  I guess it's just the fact that I am literally wasting time I could be having on a mistake that I made...or something like that."
Don't get me wrong, I know this is weird too! But ever since I was little, watching windshield wipers back and forth just fills me with a rage that I can't explain! Dunno why, just happens. 
"When I hear people making assumptions about people based on race. I work in a restaurant, not a bad one at that, and over half the servers there will try to trade away their table to you if they don't think they'll get a good tip.  This only happens when the table looks middle eastern or african american.  But worse then that, the comments that go on about the table are just really ignorant. I can't help but lose respect for my fellow servers when they do this. 
"
"Bad parenting, I grew up around kids with shitty, shitty, shitty parents who either were constantly out partying and boozing while the kid younger than 10 stays alone at home, or parents who straight up physically abused their kids.

To this day it's an instant berserk button for me, the subject of bad parenting and the trite excuses like, ""I'm trying my best"", or, ""You can't judge me, you don't have kids"" always seem to make it worse, because these are equally shitty excuses for negligent or abusive parents behaviour.

It further doesn't help that the love of my life has PTSD from the abuse he suffered at the hands of his own mother who, if she wasn't basically defaulting her obligation as a parent to her own parents, she was play acting at being a *good* mom to pat herself on the back, while also being physically violent with her kids. My boyfriend doesn't really have anything to do with her, and I have no issue understanding why."
"I read the title as ""instantly makes you hungry."" Needless to say, the responses left me a little confused."
As a guy (I don't know if it's a guy thing or not) people touching my nipples. It's a blind rage type thing. I'm a big guy, I know I got floppy titties. Don't touch them dammit.

"Religious fanatics, or anyone who tries to preach to me. It gets even worse when I tell them I am an atheist and they continue to try and ""save me""."
I'm from Denmark. It has somehow become fashion to wear a american flag. I don't know why but when i see a group of people having no idea what they are wearing/promoting i get angry.
lack of social couth underclass behavior, let wear our under clothes in public, talk like a drunk sailor in the middle of store lets spit in a public walkway, degrade you children in public, talk about how our SO and you had great sex on facebook, any way you guys get the picture,

when the vacuum cord gets caught on some impossible object across a long empty room, and you cant get it uncaught no matter how hard you yank or swing it- but a very gentle tug at the place where its stuck will dislodge it.  edit:rambling
"In my country we're close to elections, so we're filled with political ads everywhere. They just fucking get me. I just can't believe that people actually vote for these guys when all their ads sum to ""Hi, I know you're stupid, so I will say a couple words that are exactly what you want to hear, and you'll vote me, sucker""."
One uppers and those that can't be wrong.... No one's that perfect or awesome and everyone knows what you're doing!!!!!
When I step in something wet without shoes on. Or when there isn't a towel next to the sink and you have to carry your dripping hands across the room to get one.
When someone passes me on the right when were the only two cars on a three lane highway. Fucking kill someone.
"People at my college that never do their homework and are riding completely on their parent's money.    

On the brightside, my work ethic won't bite me in the ass when I'm out of school."
When someone tells me not to curse to a grown adult. I understand and try my best not to curse around children, but If it's only adults around and you don't like my cursing. To fucking bad, you're an adult you've heard them all before.
My damn colleague who is ALWAYS on reddit instead of working like the rest of us. YES YOU, Start working!
People to don't use their turn signals, stop at the top of escalators and staircases, people who don't have their metro cards ready and get them out while blocking a turn style on the subway. These people are on my personal depopulation list because they have absolute no regard for others on the simplest level.
"1. When someone is having a bad day and takes it out on me with a bitchy attitude just because I happen to be next to them.
2. People who feel they are entitled to do things to/with you or items you are currently using without asking first. *(Example: Can't find something on my computer so friend reaches over and grabs the mouse from me. Instant rage.)*
3. People who start an argument just because they love winning or being ""right"" and really have no intention of listening to the other side whatsoever."
"It enrages me to see someone harm a child. I am a parent and I know we all have rough days.  Sometimes you are going to overreact and yell at your kid when they are not doing anything wrong simply because you are at your wits end. But calling them names, telling them you will get rid of or kill them or even grabbing them too roughly makes me angry.  

It's the kids' faces that does it: that look of terror and emptiness, like the only thing they have in life to depend on is destroying them."
Car horns. I don't know why. I get immediately incensed as soon as I hear a car horn. It doesn't even have to be directed at me. It makes no sense.
People chewing with their mouths open. Takes about three seconds before the rage sets in. If they laugh with food in their mouth, or talk, I'm ready to kill somebody. 
Being lied to. I hate that so much. Destroys any trust that I had in that person and instantly makes me so angry that I trusted them to begin with. 
"i could be having a really good night but if i end up being dragged to certain bars that i know certain kinds of people are regulars at, i get into a reeeeeeeeeeeally bad mood that lasts the remainder of the night. Most of the people are the same people i went to school with. They are just 20-something-year-olds that listen to rap and pop music, drink beer, grind/hump each other (cause they are so edge and wild!) and that is about the depth of their lives.
I don't think I could give a rational explanation to why I hate these kinds of people but it has always been there for me since middle school. Most of them spent there younger years being superficial and horrible to others and then they still find love and fortune in the end. Some will say that i am just jealous and honestly they are probably right. Nowhere am I reminded of this more than when I see their prosperity at the bar with their friends and significant others and their good times and their boundless happiness and they never had anything else."
People who bring infant/toddlers to a movie...usually a action movie with lots of explosions and screaming...I really want to walk over there and smack the parents in the face...

littering (especially next to a trash can)  
small children in restaurants that serve alcohol after 8pm

"You know who pisses me off?

Pedestrians

I swear to christ, these fuckers will walk right in front of your car without the slightest thought.  *Oh, your backing your car up, why don't I just stroll right behind you, right of way and such.*  And if I see a group of people about to cross the street, do not stop for five seconds and chat at the edge of the sidewalk, and *then* decide to walk, because by then I've already started moving my car again. Jesus H. Fuck, it's like people lack the mental capacity to think when they're walking around the parking lot.  *Oh, I'm only strolling through a giant asphalt driveway surrounded by two-thousand pound machines  powered by miniature explosions which account for tens of thousands of deaths each year, I think I'll skip across the street and ignore them while expecting them to pause for my every step.*"
People lying to me. Even if they are white lies. I'm not normally one to get angry frustrated yes, irritated yes but I can count the times I've been truly angry this year on one hand. But if I catch someone lying to me I see black.
When the person who last took out the trash doesn't put a new trash bag in the can and I throw something messy away without looking. Killing rage right there.
When your seatbelt starts to constrict aroound you, getting tighter and tighter all because you turned your body a little too fast.
"Drivers who tail gate me. As soon as i see them really close, i turn on my wipers and slam on my brakes. When they drive past me, i chase them with my high beams. 

yeah i have a problem."
"People ask me constantly ""What's wrong?"" or ""Are you ok?""  or ""Are you in a bad mood today?""

No, no I wasn't.  Just because I'm not fucking smiling and showing you any attention means that I'm sick or grumpy?  Can't I just not smile and socialize?  

I actually fly into a mental rage when anyone decides it's wrong for me not to smile and be bubbly. "
"When people flake out .3 seconds before an arrangement. 

""Oh yeah, you know how we've been planning that movie for a week? Yeah I know it's like 7:59 PM, but I've got a thing. Bye"" 

not even a fucking sorry! buncha wankers "
Injustice... That might sound cheesy or all white knight but when something was unfair in school (like a teacher who punished the wrong person or something) I can't help myself anymore. I HAVE to say something until it is set right and I will do everything I possibly can do fix it.
"Traffic light/speed cameras capable of issuing tickets.

Little women driving huge cars

Someone tailgating me

Someone trying to cut me off

Someone talking/texting while driving

Someone waiting until the last min to change from 2 lanes to one.

Basically anything that happens while I am driving in the city."
"""Daylight Saving"" In fact, just typing the bloody words has already enraged me. Better leave this thread now."
Really anything to do with driving in general. I've long said that driving is analogous to life. It's way easier if you're just an asshole and only look out for yourself.
Elderly abuse. Ever since I was a small child, seeing this in real life, or hell even on TV, just makes my blood boil.
When people don't hit the freaking reset button on the microwave after they pull their food out. Drives me crazy.
"People who post on Facebook only giving you half of the information (e.g. ""Oh my summer just turned epic"" ""Oh after what happened today I can die happily"" etc...) . Worst thing is: if you ask them what happened THEY WON'T TELL YOU !! What the heck!!!"
"When someone doesn't even acknowledge me (or even worse gives me a glare) when I hold the door for them.

I know I shouldn't do good things expecting anything in return, BUT ITS JUST COMMON COURTESY

A wave, a nod, anything to acknowledge me"
I went on a trip to Europe with a girl I work with. It was her idea. And for the three weeks we were there, she did not want to to do anything or see anything. She was content to just saying in her bed in the hotel until noon and had no desire to see The Eiffel Tower, Monte Carlo Casino, or Leaning Tower of Pisa, among other things. It felt like dragging your grumpy child around on vacation every single day for three weeks. Why would you spend thousands of dollars on a vacation when all you want to do is stay in the hotel? Rent a hotel room in your town for three weeks and just stay there. Anytime people bring up that trip I get so mad because of her laziness. Besides that I actually had a lovely time because I got to see everything I wanted to see. 
"Fucking flies. They make me lose my shit. 

Also when my Pokemon gets confused and hits himself. Boils my beans."
When people unabashedly stare at you for no reason. For example, on public transit, people who just turn towards you and stare at you blatantly the entire time. I always want to loudly call them out but then I think maybe they have a disability... always makes me irrationally angry, though. 
"Noise when I'm trying to sleep (think any kind of shifting from whoever is in the room/apartment). 

I work tech support so people call in frequently for help setting things up. I hate when customers talk OVER me and refuse to let me talk even though they're doing it wrong."
When i ask someone to watch a video on the screen or tv, they agree but after 4 seconds go back to doing whatever on their phone or walk off... fuck you.
"When people pronounce ""height"" with a ""-th"" sound at the end. I sort of understand the reasoning...length and width end with ""-th"" but damnit if it pisses me off every time."
The majority of people who play League of Legends. I don't expect anyone in the game to be more than an utter scumbag.
"Salespeople who assume I'm an unintelligent dolt who will believe every fantastical tale they tell me in order to make some cash.

Hint: I'm kind of smart, and no, I don't believe you. I doubt six residents on my street contacted your no-name security company to setup new service within the last seven hours. You reek of cigarettes, your lies aren't even that good, your statistics are made up, and I want to fucking throttle you.

TL;DR - apparently my answer is ""door to door salespeople""."
Abuse of any kind. Personal reasons for me, but child abuse absolutely tops the list though. I turn into a seething, rage filled beast. It helps that I'm a pretty burly dude. I absolutely lose my cool and start seeing red. Relationship abuse too. And animal abuse.
"When I hear the use of the word ""sheeple"". Just hate it. It's a flippant, arrogant and lazy way to put down anyone who disagrees with you."

When people are late, especially after I say, 'I hate it when people are late, pls don't be late gooby.'
My theology class. It is no where near theology. It's more of a study why all the other religions are wrong. 
When I'm in a crosswalk and a driver starts inching forward, riding my ass to turn. Bitch, I have the right of way. You can wait two fucking seconds for me to finish crossing the street.
"Kids being abused, mistreated, or otherwise not taken care of in a safe manner.

"1) When I'm watching TV with someone, and something hilarious happens. They then they ask to rewind it so they can see because they were looking at their phone. 
2) When someone won't look at me when I'm talking to them because looking at Facebook on their phone is too important. 
3) Hitting my head on shit."
"Being 100% right in an argument and the other person keeps saying you aren't or he/she starts blurting babysounds because they feel like it.  
  
I'mma smack the skin off of your face and tie it around the neck of my goat if you do that."
When people talk about things that they don't quite understand... Also I'm annoyed by people who talk too much.
Gridlock.... People who pull into an intersection when there isn't space and then their light turns red. Now my light turns green but can't drive through because this asshat is parked in the middle of the intersection. Calm to raging volcano in half a second. 
When I'm loading food into the fridge/freezer after grocery shopping and stuff starts falling out one after the other. Most unreasonable time for me to get infuriated.
People who invite you over just to spend the whole fucking time texting.  Don't invite me over to hangout/Do shit just to sit on your god damn phone.
When you're at the store, and someone hits you in the back of the foot/heel/Achilles with a shopping cart. I tell my friends that they get one freebie. After that, murder is a justifiable response to their blatant shopping cart abuse.
People who kick the back of a chair or try to put their feet on it when someone is sitting there. If it's a kid, I just get annoyed. If an adult does it, I go batshit on them.
"As a scientist i am enraged by people that live by ideals that are completely incorrect:

for example: 

not vaccinating your children because you are afraid of them acquiring autism

not drinking diet soda because you think it gives you cancer"
Getting behind two people driving side-by-side at the same speed on a two lane interstate. I'm instantly angry and gradually become enraged the longer they stay that way. Left lane is for passing. If you aren't, get out.
Getting one of my earbuds yanked out while listening to something. Whatever you have to say, believe it or not, it can wait the extra second for me to take out my earbud myself.
"Animal abuse. 

I can see a picture of starving children, and although it is profoundly sad, it doesn't anger me. I feel pity and empathy for those people, not anger towards their parents. 

I can see one picture of a guy kicking a dog, and I want to bludgeon that motherfucker within an inch of his life. It's completely irrational, but I can't control how I feel. It makes my blood boil like nothing else. 

Animals, to me, are completely innocent. They have no malice. Humans... well, most of you are ok. *Most*. "
"People who go fast, either walking or driving, and instead of going around me they insist I either move or speed up. I'm a sunday driver- I enjoy going slow to see the places around me, and going fast makes me anxious. I'm pissed that people are so entitled and hoity-toity that they actually think that going around a slow individual is too much work for them, and can easily pass it off as the slow individual having ""lesser"" brains- like that makes any goddamn sense.

Assholes washing their windshields in traffic, spraying every car behind them across three lanes. Wait until you've fucking stopped, you asshat!

"When I'm driving, and that impatient fuck squeezes in to the right of you, which is usually not a lane and then they try and cut around you and others and work their way back in to the real traffic lane.


I usually try blocking them when I see whats about to happen.  If they sneak by I usually just honk and yell and pretend the speck of dirt on my windshield is a gunsite for a quad mount .50 cal anti-air setup on my Jeep."
An unwillingness to except information as truth and alter opinions when provided with ample evidence.
"Ignorance. Specifically, willful.

I absolutely cannot stand people who use things like
religious preferences or ideologies to be hate-mongers."
"While at bars and pubs, things can get a little rowdy. People can call me or my GF names, even push me, and I'll be able to keep my cool ""How about we both just enjoy our pints"" kind of thing. What instantly gets me into a frenzy is when someone spits at me. No idea why."
People who stand right outside of a doorway to hold a conversation with another person. I feel like it should be legal to slam these people to the ground. 
Grocery shopping.  Just walking in the joint pisses me off.  Then when you are moving down an aisle and that one person is either oblivious to the fact that there are other shoppers in store and they have to block everything they can or they stand and chat in the worst spots causing others to suffer. This happened last Christmas I picked up some prime rib and was looking at it basically for our holiday meal and this woman comes running in and sees that I have the last one in my hand. She grabs it and makes her get away. I actually tried to catch her to get it back but it was like she just vanished.  So yeah I get angry when grocery shopping. 
When you're waiting in a long line of cars in the right/left lane for a really long time and some asshole tries to pass by everybody and cut the line, also thereby creating a dangerous traffic situation since his assholy ass is sticking out in the moving traffic lanes. RAGE fills me as I think of it.
"Watching someone bully someone for no reason, people in my high school were a lot more kind than most everyone in my college and it's sad because these people are celebrated for it. It makes me more angry now too because before I had the power to get these people to stop making fun of other people because I was one of the ""cool"" kids but now when I interject they lump me in with the bullied and I'm not sure what to do anymore without the power to make it stop. Makes me angry. "
I need to have a vague incline on what the colour is for my sake!! Stick with primary colours... Bad enough I mess them up never mind those monstrosity's you mentioned haha also when someone sales something is a bluey green... Fuck them!! To completely separate colours ... How can something be both? Makes no sense to my broken eyes :-(
"When I make a glorious meal for my daughter and she takes one bite and says ""all done"" ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!"
"When my father and I drive on a two lane highway, you can commonly encounter what we call, ""the wall of misery"". When two cars block any attempt at passing by matching each others speed, and you are just stuck there behind them.

Also people who take calls while driving. It can wait."
"People who bring and play their acoustic guitar everywhere. We get it, you're a douche and you own a guitar. 

I hope to one day muster up the courage to snatch away said guitar in an Animal House fashion and SMASH IT!"
"People who think being obese is alright. IT'S NOT OK!!! I don't shame anyone randomly but if you are claiming that you should be proud of your body while being overweight I will be the first to stand up and call your BS.
You shouldn't feel comfortable, being uncomfortable forces change. "
Passive aggression will usually incite my regular aggression.  Even if it's not directed toward me, I still want to choke out the smug fuck.  I catch myself being passive aggressive occasionally and I feel like a complete twat.
"Being woken up to loud noises. Particularly, metal music. I am a peaceful person, but if you wake me up to metal, I envision killing babies after doing terrible, psychotic things to you. 

EDIT: Also, when you tell a friend you are interested in someone, and said ""friend"" instantly starts flirting and showing your interest waaay too much attention. Seriously, go back to high school and attempt to raise your obviously lacking self-esteem elsewhere, bitch. "
"People getting upset about women breast feeding in public. Not to mention, the lack of maternity care in general in America and people trying to use scare-mongering tactics to get women into hospitals instead of birthing centers or home births for low risk pregnancies.  
Arguments about abortion. 
Someone taking advantage of my friends. 
Cochlear implants and the prevalence of parents being told it's the only option for their child to be ""normal.""

Edit: Ooh! Also, slut shaming and telling thin women they aren't ""real"" women. "
"When people cross the street just far enough away from a cross walk to know that they're only doing it to show how they're too cool for rules. I'm perfectly fine with people not using a crosswalk on an empty street or something, but when it's just to prove to a bunch of strangers how badass you are it grinds the fuck out of my gears. 

Same goes for people who stand in really inopportune places and then act surprised when you ask them to move. Fuck that.  "
When I'm biking through a heavy pedestrian area on campus and people are walking in the middle of the path with their head down, looking at their phone, and are blasting music through both headphones. They can't see anyone beyond their 5 ft of peripheral vision, they can't hear anyone coming behind them, and there's not enough room to pass on either side. Keep right, pass left is applicable off the road, friends. Even worse when they change directions randomly and don't check over their shoulder. 
"At a school assembly when someone sitting at the back of the room has a phone that goes off, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON TURNS AROUND TO LOOK. Not only is it annoying, but it's extremely disrespectful to whoever is speaking. It's basically everyone saying ""We find a ringtone more interesting than your speech."""
People who play Mario Kart Wii or Super Smash Bros. Brawl with GameCube controllers.  I have gotten violent over this.  Don't do these things in my presence.
"People who constantly click their pen. 
People who always ask to borrow pens, but never give them back. 
Pens that constantly act 'empty' when you actually just have to scribble a little to make it work. "
I cannot stand it when I approach a public microwave,  like at work or something,  and some Asshole has left time on the microwave.  Just infuriating. Hit clear! 
"When I was in like 7th grade my younger brother stole my Pokemon cards (I had like hundreds and lots of powerful/ rare ones) It pissed me off but I didn't know what to do, so he has not gotten a proper punishment. Yet . . . . But whenever I think about starting up another collection I get so angry at him all over again
When I hit my head (been said several times but it pisses me off) "
When people assume I don't know what I'm talking about before they give me a chance to explain myself
"Bicyclists. 

Fucking cunts. Fuck you and you're fucking urban outfitter bullshit. Go get ran over by a truck because you never ever fucking obey a single fucking traffic law. "
When someone knocks my hat off. I don't ever wear hats anymore. But if I was and someone did, **watch out**.
I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer. Got medical and then refused... Same with marine engineer and anything, ironically, to do with the military. I know people in the position I wanted to be that are colour blind.... Really annoys me. 
"Having a friend that I haven't heard from in a few months suddenly call me up with a ""Business Opportunity""..."
As someone who works security from time to time the one thing that sets me off sooner than anything else is people who try to talk tough as they are walking away from a negative exchange.
People who don't use their turn signals- It's really not that hard- you move your finger an inch or so- it's just common road courtesy (and helps prevent accidents).
"Advertising that overtly uses bad gender or cultural stereotypes to attract interest in their product.  

Example: McDonald's abrupt switch to ""hip-hop"" themed advertisements some years back."
"So Back in the day I was a short hefty lad that got made fun of constantly. I lost it all, but I guess I still have some fat kid ptsd. Working at the YMCA day camp last summer I encountered a young big girl crying and saw three boys making fun of her. I instantly got super pissed, stood up, and yelled, ""HEY! THAT IS NOT COOL"" in a very aggressive tone. They ended up crying and I had to talk with my boss, but hopefully they learned there lesson lol  "
when someone ruffles my hair. some dude i like know in passing came into a bar where i always chill and hes drunk and decides to ruffle my hair like im some sort of child cause idk, maybe cause hes older than me? i put him up against the bar by his collar and told him if he ever treated me like a kid again id make him suck my cock and crack his chickenhead neck on climax. then i straightened him out and told him to get the fuck outta my bar. bonus: bartender told him to leave. full of win.
I get really angry when I hit my head, and I get super angry if I see animal abuse, I turn into a rage driven bag of meat that wants to kill people that hurt cats, and dogs.
"Child Beauty Pageants. 

No amount of trying to convince me these are beneficial to children will convince me. Teach your child a skill, literally anything is better than this. "
Stumbling over anything in the dark. I already hate walking around in the dark, but stumbling over something really pisses me off.
Anyone who has an acoustic guitar and decides to start playing it at a party. This seems to happen all the time and I'd like nothing more than to bash their brains in. Not everyone cares to hear your dumb noodling.
Being obnoxiously loud and ghetto.  Tailgating in a traffic jam.  Or worst, trying to pass you in a traffic jam as if getting in front of you will make your trip faster.
"Bad drivers. 

Accidents caused by bad driving kill thousands every year yet people take driving for granted and continue bad driving habits and techniques that endanger everyone around them and themselves. Bad habits and techniques leading to driving mistakes KILL people. "
stupidity, to be more specific when im behind the wheel and people blatantly fuck something up whether it be wrong/no signal driving 5+ below the speed limit, i flip instantly and i dont have much of a temper at all. also dying in first person shooters, no one likes that shit
"Knocking something over when cooking. It makes me irrationally angry and my boyfriend always seems kind of confused as to why I'm reacting so strongly. I live in a small apartment so I think im just reacting to lack of space. 
"
Thinking that the US government has essentially open borders when we have a massive enough population as it is.
People who wave like freakin idiots at tv camera's, no-one in the history of the universe cares if you were in a background shot of a news report! no-one! 
Someone driving the same speed as the person next to them on the highway. Fuckin move asshole before I decide I hate you more than I like being alive and out of prison.
A man not giving up his seat on a bus/busy restaurant waiting area/whatever  to an elderly person, obviously pregnant person or someone with a young child(ren). I understand that some think it's sexist, but I think it's just good manners.
my girlfriend getting frustrated because she cant parallel park, so she only looks for parking spots she can pull into.
When I go to get my first cup of coffee at the office, and someone leaves less than half a cup so they don't have to make a new pot....happens almost every day.
" I have a list:

1. When 12 or 13 year olds take pictures of themselves in bikinis and skimpy clothing (usually pointing the camera towards their chest) and post them on social media.

2. When people are driving 30 MPH on the freeway when you're trying to get on.

3. When people pull out in front of you, then honk at you because you were ""in their way"". 

4. When people talk during lectures. (Why are you even there if you're just going to talk?)

5. When people act like they're being bullied if someone merely criticizes them. There is a difference between criticizing and real bullying. Learn it.

6. When people incite arguments and then claim that they either aren't arguing (oh really?) or that you started it.

7. When people at the mall attempt to text and walk, people have ran into me multiple times because they haven't watched where they're going. Please move off to the side before texting."
Drivers who don't signal. Doesn't even have to effect me, just really bothers me. It's such a simple thing to do but almost no one does it anymore.
"My door slamming.

If I leave it open and the door slams it (and it'll do it repeatedly because the door latch is old and kinda broken and won't shut with brute force), it literally makes me want to get up and punch a bloody hole in my door.

Most insane, inexplicable desire. But it happens every time."
Comcast, like I seriously can't think about them or my mind will get all wrapped up in all of the shit that I've dealt with.  Like, writing this post irritates me.  I also used to work for them.
People that stand on escalators, rather than continue moving up the steps.  Escalators are intended to accelerate the ambulatory rate, not to move your ass like a conveyor belt.  You're holding up the fucking show.  All of you! 
The customers you get in retail who buy four twelve packs of Mountain Dew, a box of twinkies, and two cases of red bull, pay for it all with food stamps, and then use cash to buy cigarettes. All while their eighteen inbred fuckhead children scream and cry while they bitch at you. Rage inducing for sure 
People who get into minor fender-benders and feel it's absolutely necessary that they leave their cars in the middle of the fucking road, blocking traffic for miles, because of reasons. Everyone has a smartphone with a camera & video. Snap a few photos if you must, take a short video if you must, but move your fucking car off the road, assholes. I live in NYC, where a single stalled vehicle can snarl traffic for miles. Leave the traffic jams to serious accidents where either people are injured, or your car literally will not move. If I can drive by the accident, and not see any obvious damage that would incapacitate your car...please, do the rest of us a favor and pull over to the shoulder, or put on your hazards and get off at the next exit. I just don't understand that shit.
People who litter. If I see someone throw something on the ground outside I will stare at them until they see that I am staring them the fuck down.  It's priceless when the bend over and pick it back up. 
When I try to plug something in and it doesn't go in the first time, I freak out and can't get it in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth time.
"After reading this I realize an awful truth.... you people are soo angry all the time, just chill out a bit. Soo many little things get you guys full blown angry, take a deep breath and analyze if the situation requires you to stress out over practically nothing.

tl;dr you're a bunch of pent up people."
"Children who are blatantly disrespectful and rude , and their parents who just watch them do it and do absolutely nothing about it.

And banging my pinkie toe. I do it at least twice a week- usually both feet. I've broken them a ton of times and my little toe nails are all busted to hell. I'll probably end up losing both of the nails eventually."
"My glasses are not fucking toy.

I spent an obscene amount of money to get something that not only helps me see but is a part of my face, daily.

Oh you think my glasses are pretty and wonder how you would look in them? Buy a pair.

Oh, and fuck off."
Somebody parking in my parking spot at my condo.  Happens all the time, because the visitor parking is right beside me.  I go ballistic when this happens.
"When you're upset at someone and they try to manipulate the situation so as to make you out to be the bad guy for being upset at them.

""Dude, are you really that upset?""
""Dude, it's just x""
""You really care that much about x?""

Yes, asshole! That's why we're talking about it. Don't fucking backpedal because you have to take responsibility for your actions."
"When someone opens the door when they enter my room and leave it open upon exiting.
It's like facing all my favourite character's deaths in Game of Thrones x10"
In Brooklyn being stuck behind the sanitation depot picking up garbage in middle of the F'en day, causing mega traffic...
"Cruelty to animals. I don't mind killing of animals if they are going be consumed. However, when animals are killed or worse tortured for merely sport or ""fun"" makes me wanna do the same damage to the people doing it."
Being the only person responsible for getting things done while the rest don't care or won't help even though they benefit...crummers, free-loaders and lazy people anger me.
"I suffer from Misophonia, so pretty much the sound of someone else eating drives me to a rage.   The clink-clink of flatware on ceramic dishes, the clicking of a nail-clipper, the sound of someone munching and crunching their food.

I am not a violent person, but those sounds make me want to scream at the top of my lungs...
"
When people just leave there baskets in the middle of parking spots. It's too hard for people to walk ten feet and put it away. That shit gets me irritated.
Students who cry cause they didn't get 100 on their test. i'm happy when i get a 60 on a test because at least i passed.
People who quote early presidents pertaining to something happening now. They were assholes and not at all relevant to current events.
"For some reason this happens whenever I see/contacted by my mom, especially outside of the house around town. Literally I could be having a great day and I get a text or call from her and my day instantly takes a turn. At home she has so many little things that drives me insane, and now it just flares me up. I haven't found anything else that does this to this extent. 

Does this happen to anyone else with their family? "
People that leave shopping carts all over parking lots.  They built those cart corrals for a reason, people!
Seeing a Nissan Cube from behind. I get instantly furious and would do anything to be able to smash the right side of the rear window with a baseball bat.
When Im at a self checkout at a super market and someone stands like 1 foot behind me breathing down my fucking neck. Im getting mad just thinking about it.
Computer problems. I've always been very slow to anger in most situations with the exception of a shitty computer or internet connection. If my computer freezes or web pages won't load I get an immediate compulsive urge to put my fist through my monitor. It's really the only time I ever feel that mad.
Not instant red rage but I've been noticing it more recently, public smoking. People don't shit in public because it would bother other people, mainly with smell. Smoking is only slightly better because it does not linger as much.
Anytime I see someone operating a motor vehicle with a cell phone in their hand. Bonus rage if neither hand is on the wheel and attention diverted. Triple points if its a woman in a big vehicle.
"i know a guy that thinks that if you get paid for doing something, what you are doing must be good.  he says this to cover up the fact that his Youtube account, which is partnered with a small company, is really just the same as everything else in the world.  



basicly, if you bring up that his Youtube account is nothing special, he will cover himself with ""well i get paid for it"".  it send everyone that knows him into a rage.  

also, when people are TOO happy with a joke they made.  like, someone tells a shitty joke, but they look really smug and proud that they told the joke.  "
"People who write emails/talk on the Internet and end their sentences like this... 

Like they want to say more but leave you hanging... 

Over and over... I can't write like this anymore it's making my blood pressure rise to alarming levels. "
"slow and freezing computers

I mean, I know it's a direct result of me being spoiled and taking today's fast computers for granted but holy shit, it's like it pokes the rage button in my brain. I get so angry, just... so angry. "
When my roommates leave their beer cans and chew spitters all over the apartment. It's pretty simple to throw something away.
Improper use of car seats. If you couldn't be bothered to read up on how to install one, how to put baby in one, or how they need to be rear facing, you probably are not a good parent.
"People who tear down things simply because they don't like them.  Such as when people post all over musicians stuff and get into arguments which boil down to ""stop liking things I don't like"".  If you don't like something you can simply not listen to, watch or read it."
When a pair of scissors comes in tightly sealed, plastic packaging...And the reason I bought the scissors is because my other pair broke. 
"My boss

He's actually a kind of alright guy but he has some really really REALLY annoying tendencies. 

He talks too much about politics and is way way way too conservative. He talks shit about everyone in the building at least once a day, me included in sure. He is hypocritical, especially if you compare his mistakes to other's in the building. Worst of all are his bad jokes, then how offended he gets when you don't laugh...that makes me angry. 

He is pretty laid back and easy going and can be interesting to talk to, which is whyi said he is kind of alright. But most days I just wished he would shut his fucking mouth and let me work. "
When you're texting someone (especially if it's a crush) and they don't text back for an hour(s). Then, they respond like nothing happened. No apology. No explanation. 
Racism, and I mean real racism. It is treated so casually here in Australia, and makes me see red when I experience it. (I am a white aussie, but spent 6 years as a kid living in Aboriginal communities) 
Larry fucking King. JUST FUCKING DROP DEAD YOU FUCKING VAMPIRE. WHAT ARE YOU! LIKE 800 YEARS OLD. YOU FUCKING KNEW THE INDIANS PERSONALLY DIDNT YOU YOU FUCKING OLD BITCH. WE ALL KNOW YOUR NOT 70ISH. JUST FUCKING DIE AND YOU'LL MEET JESUS, THE GUY YOU MET 2000 FUCKING YEARS AGO.

Instant rage.  Instant fucking rage. .."
"Observing a child being subjected to traditional, fundamentalist, anti-science, anti-history, religious [dogma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D8AeiAamjY).

I believe in freedom of religion, but to mislead innocent minds is child abuse."
I'm probably too late to the party but when somebody sneezes or coughs on me. I go from a care free dude to a raging asshole instantly.
"People that don't do what they say they'll do. Or when people don't ""man up"". Like if someone at a workplace fucks up and doesn't just man up to it but tries to get out of it by blaming others (especially subordinates). Have some fucking balls."
When I'm angry for no reason and people think they did something. No, this is about me, get the fuck over yourself 
"Talk about censorship, especially by people who don't know what they are talking about.

Show me a video of Jack Thompson talking about Bully being a Columbine simulator, or some jackass congressman talking about how all video games make you kill prostitutes for points (including Mario games), my blood boils.

Thing is, it's not usually because of the talk of censorship. Some things should not be seen (child porn, for example). I can take it when two people have a meaningful debate on censorship. But if one person suddenly starts pulling ""facts"" out of their ass and shouts the other one down, that's when I get mad.

Really, it's for all debates, but I'm very attuned to the topic of censorship. For other debates I usually just think, ""Well these two are obnoxious"" and flip the channel."
"In an argument when someone is wrong and they insist that they are right and will not let go. Then you prove that they are wrong and they shut down. 

Also, people who drive below the speed limit. "
Litter - and especially seeing people throw their cigarette butts out the car window as if they think it's not littering... or as if they do know it's littering and just don't give a hoot.
Waking up in the morning. I'm the worst asshole there is in the 30 minutes after I wake up. My family treads carefully around me until I've had breakfast
The entire concept of rape, sexual assault, and violence of that degree against a stranger or especially somebody you know. Fuck.
On a crowded train or bus with standing room only, when people don't move in to make room for other people.  Damnit!  Nobody can get passed you, and we're all crammed in like sardines near the door and you have space for 3 people behind you.  It's not good for me to start my morning with so much rage...
"People who refuse to answer simple questions just to be a dick.  For example: ""Hey man, do you know what time it is?"" ""The time."""
The thought that there are people in various cities who could help ALL the homeless in their city. With no difference in their lives other than negligible change in their bank account and choose to do nothing.
Accusing someone of racism or seeing racism where there is none. It belittles those who experience actual racism and hinders the process of eradicating racism by discrediting its other, less alarmist opponents.
Seeing or hearing people chew gum pretty much makes me want to rip my shirt off and just head-butt a wall or something.  
"Bicycles riding side-by-side on the road (as opposed to in a line).  Also, when bikers go through red lights.  They think they have the rights of cars but not the responsibility of cars.  

Basically, **fuck bicyclists...**"
When people insist that I stop being mad. I wasn't mad before, but now that you've told me to stop being mad, I'm furious.
"People who claim my opinion is ""wrong"" because they disagree with it.  Jesus fuck, you can't say something that's *subjective* is *wrong*."
"People trying to talk to me, while I'm clearly trying to listen to somebody else.

You're hanging out with a group of your friends, and friend A is telling a story. He is clearly the center of attention at this point. 

Friends B, and C, as well as yourself (Friend Ω) are listening to Friend A. 

But motherfucking Friend D has something to say, and discreetly begins trying to talk to you about something tangentially related. You don't want to be mean and say, ""Hey, D, shut the fuck up until A is done talking,"" but you also don't want to stop listening to A, because, goddammit, *he was talking first*, so you have to keep looking at A, and absently nodding your head to D, until D takes the fucking hint to wait his turn.

I have a friend who does this incessantly, and it drives me bonkers.

EDIT: Needed more adverbs. Bitches love adverbs."
When an office I'm calling, transfers my call to another department before I finish my sentence. Fucking rude.

You got 97% on your midterm? Don't worry, they will be quick to retort with that one math exam back in the day they aced.

Fights during sports (excluding martial arts and boxing.) I am unsure why but it makes me rage so hard. I realise contact sports get quite tense, but quality entertainers should have the responsibility of uplifting sportmanship, not bitchfighting on the field. Hockey in North America is the worst, as referees often let the players bitchfight it out and then only give a 5 minute penalty. Bollocks!
When my coonhound licks my labs ears. Not only is it bad for his ears but dear god that noise could make me slap my own mother.
"When someone accuses me of doing something that I didn't do, without any evidence that I did it. 

It really pisses me off when someone accuses me of something, then I defend myself, and they say I'm lying. "
"People who contact IT then question what you told them. The line: ""Well so and so said this"" REALLY gets me going. Don't fucking ask me if you aren't going to listen. There's a reason why I have years of experience and they don't."
"When people say, ""That's your opinion."" It basically translates into my head that they have no conviction, because what they think is right is unimportant, and therefore my opinion of right is just as irrelevant.

I totally realize this shouldn't cause me to flip out like it does, but it does. "
"Swag Lords. Hypocrisy in religion, animal/child abuse, Katy Perry songs that get played 30+ times a day on the radio, and racism.

"People who think they're the library staff, and instantly SHUSH other patrons for having a conversation at a reasonable volume level.

I'm going to the library in a bit, and I swear I'll encounter this."
When someone asks if I'm angry or tells me to calm down. Doesn't matter how fine I was before that, it's instant Hulk.
As a former obese person it absolutely set me the fuck off when someone would grab my man boobs and laugh. Still pisses me off now. I'm furious just thinking about the last fuckhead that did it. 
Whenever I'm in an empty movie theater, restaurant, etc and someone sits **RIGHT NEXT TO ME**. Really brings my piss to a boil...
When someones phone rings in a lecture or other quiet setting, and instead of silencing it immediately, they walk out of the room, with it still ringing, and answer it as they get to the door.

When my roommate doesn't fill the Brita pitcher after he uses it - it's such a simple thing to do! I wake up in the morning and can't even have a glass of cold, filtrated water because he empties that shit when he stumbles home drunk every night.
"When I am on the phone with my husband and I need to talk to him about something but the people he's with or the people I'm with aren't the people I want to have the conversation in front of. So I tell him, ""I wanted to talk to you about something later okay?"" 
""What did you want to talk about?"" 
""Nothing, we'll just talk later."" 
""Okay, are you sure we can't just talk now, what is it?""

For fucks sake. 

Most the time it isn't even SUPER serious, but just stuff I don't want his overbearing mom or my coworkers knowing about - like how my doctor appt. went, or  what my brother in jail said when he called me or this random bill. "
People who turn left off of main arterial streets during rush hour and thus cause a massive back up while they wait for an opening that will never come. I usually have very good control over my anger but incompetent drivers may one day drive me to murder. 
I have a special leash with 2 ends with a handle in the middle, It drives me nuts when one dog goes around a tree or mailbox on the wrong side and gets us all tangled. All the while I am getting him sorted out the other dog has made 2 laps around the damn thing.
People who yell at each other in meetings.  Look, we're all working for the man here. We don't need to start tearing into each other. Act like an adult to resolve your problems, don't yell in an enclosed room because someone wants to tackle a problem in a different way than you.
When someone asks you if you're pissed off, while you're already pissed off.  Especially in a work setting. 
When you are eating a burger and the patty and all the toppings are sliding out of the back. All I want is to eat the delicious burger and it is ruining away from me. Instantly makes me pissed
Sounds.  Breathing, when people chew with their mouths open, typing on this keyboard.  Misophonia is a bitch.

When someone calls you on the the telephone, just so they can talk to everyone around them and not you. 
When someone tells me I have to do something and then repeats it, even though I just heard them, as if I didn't hear them. It makes me feel stupid and I get angry immediately.
"Panda Bears.

I just can't take that the world spends all this time and money on conserving a species that is so dumb, it won't breed on it's own. And all because it's cute. I just wish charities like the WWF would focus on some of the not cute species. Like no one seems to care that honey bees are potentially going to die out."

"When someone pulls up behind me in traffic and has their bass booming so loud it is rattling my windows. 

It fills me with an uncontrollable red hot rage. I am a very calm, laid back, tries to see from everyone's point of view, 30 year old woman. When I get hit with loud bass I feel like I'm being physically assaulted and the one and only thing I imagine could appease this rage would be to get out of my car, grab a baseball bat out of my back seat and whack out their headlights before getting back in the car and speeding away. 

It hurts my ears, hurts my head and since I can't hear the actual music there's not context. Just rhythmic pain. I sing in a rock band, I'm used to very loud music and I stand very close to the drummer who doesn't hold back. At concerts I don't mind being near the speakers and feeling the boom as it fills your chest and rattles your organs. When you can hear the music that goes with it, it's pleasurable. When it's unattached thumping my animal brain says I'm being hurt and I'm under attack. It's awful. 

There was a place I lived in Florida very close to a road where people would slowly cruise by blasting their music. I'd be sitting on my couch and start to feel my teeth rattle and it would just flip a switch of hate on inside of me. Now where I live sometimes the neighbor cranks his car stereo to top volume while washing his car and I can't hear anything but the brrrrmmmmm brrrrmmmmm of the bass coming through my walls. Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

"There's a few things.

Women who take one to two full minutes reinserting bank cards, cash and what ever else into their overpacked purse, standing in front of and blocking the ATM when they could complete their organization off the the side.

This also goes for people who have inane conversations with cashiers when there is a queue of people waiting to pay and GTFO. WRAP IT UP, LADY.

People who can't manage their cars headlights properly, either intentionally (Cheap after market HID kits, i'm looking at you) or just because they are oblivious mother fuckers. Headlights off at night, or with the high beams on without knowing.

Those 3 would be main ones."
"When people blame the President of the United States for things that have absolutely nothing to do with him (or for future reserve, her). 

For example I was telling my mother about a local Cargill plant that was screwing over their workers and the farmers. Her reply was ""typical Obama."" At which point I rage faced and blurted out ""Oh, is Obama the President of Cargill too?!""

*This goes for all Presidents, not just Obama  I don't even like Obama, but I was still pissed off at her ignorance.*"

When I try putting on a pair of pants and they're too tight.  For some reason, it infuriates me and I launch the pants across the room.
I am a school student and I really hate it when people don't do shit and when the teacher wants their notebook, they just start panicking and say the teacher is an idiot....also students who get F's and laugh and smile like they just got laid.
When you're driving in a parking lot and there are people who clearly have no idea where they're driving. Too many times people stop trying to figure out which row they're going down or what spot they're going to pick. It amazes me how many people pass the driving test who clearly shouldn't have.
I get extremely pissed off when I am untangling cords or if a I am walking with a cord and it snags on every possible obstacle in my path. 
"Ugh so many things.

"People talking down to me. Even if I'm wrong, all you have to do is correct me. ""Um, what? Haha, that's not real! You can't trust everything you read, hun. Let me tell you the *truth*...."" Such bullshit."
"I get really mad whenever I see students act like dicks to their teachers. I'm in highschool, so, of course I'm not wise or anything, but at least I'm not like some of the lunatics that I sit with in my classes. I'm sure it could be worse, they could be targeting me or actually hurting others, but maybe that's why I get mad. The teachers never do anything about smartasses, because, honestly they can't, since they know that nothing will stop the crazier kids. Recently, someone at the back of the room was chatting in class, and the teacher let him know that she could hear him back there. He quickly replied ""I don't care..."" and went back to talking about... farts. Yes, he and his twin brother dickhead were having a deep conversation about farts. The teacher didn't say anything more. If I were in that position, I'd probably end up impulsively kicking the shit out of that brat.

I dunno, maybe I'm overreacting, but I see these scumbags everyday and I can't believe people my age are such assholes. I mean, sure, every generation has bad people, but I feel like almost a quarter of my grade is actually distracting the other 75% with their obnoxiousness. It's absolute chaos, even though my school is in a pretty good area and there isn't even any violence. We're out in the country.

Oh well. Sorry if this just sounds like teen angst and whining. I know things could be a hell of a lot worse, but as it stands, I just get really mad with all those dicks."
Cyclists during rush hour, in the morning or evening.  They never seem to follow the rules of the road.  I always feel like they're deliberately getting in the way when there are a lot of other people going to and from work.  
"People that spread knowledge they ""think"" they know, like the time i heard people arguing over the Higgs boson i thought ""Hey that sounds like it could be interesting"" and after i did like 10 minutes of actual fucking research i thought ""I wasted precious minutes of my life listening to them argue, fuck"" "
Being a clueless schmuck while on your cell phone.  Examples include: driving like an idiot; not holding doors/letting them slam on people;  talking while checking out at a grocery store; etc etc
There should be only one crime punishable by death in this world and that is talking to your friend in the middle of a fucking doorway! Why would anyone ever think it's a good idea to just hang out directly in the center of the exit to a room? And then THEY get mad when YOU have to move past them what the fuck!? I hate that so much it makes me absolutely livid! 
I live on a street where there is a school up the road from me. The only way out is a side road that a lot of score moms use to get to school. The problem is when I try backing out of my driveway moms that drive huge vans and big ass suburbans flip me off. I have to go through this every morning. 
People who are racist.... Especially to people who are racist over the internet. Reddit i know some of you guys claim you aren't, but seriously some stuff posted on here just really makes me mad.
"Anti-vaccination parents. I worked as a nurse at a Jewish summer camp for a while. I had several parents try and argue with me over our mandatory vaccination policy. It took so much effort to limit my comments to just telling them that what they are doing is unsafe for their kids.

If you don't like vaccinations and don't want them then fine, don't ensure your kids never get vaccinated. You are openly taking this disease that could kill your child and choosing to risk your child dying because you're an idiot. I really wish this was considered child neglect so I could do something about it.

There was an outbreak of disease among an anti-vaccination group of Jewish people in NY recently. Kids died. Every one of their parents should have been charged with killing their kids."
Being slapped in the face. I fucking hate it!  Its my trigger.  I see red and want to fight whoever it is that slapped me.  I don;t care who it is or what the situation is, its just like a switch of hate is turned on and I want to punish whatever it is that slapped me.  Its disrespectful, and your face gets all red.  Have those burning ears for hours.  God damn Im getting worked up just thinking about it! 
Inconsiderate parking. I live in an urban neighborhood with very limited parking, so I have to spend some time looking for a spot when I get home at the end of the day. Now, I'm a pretty patient man, and I'm perfectly fine if this takes longer than usual when it's a busy day, but if I see someone taking more than one space I get instantly angry beyond what I recognize should be normal in that situation.

"Fucking conspiracy theorists who get their ""facts"" from extremely biased and inaccurate sources and then call me
an ""ignorant sheep"" because I usually get my facts from the news (different stations and mediums... I always figure the truth is somewhere in the middle). Don't even get me started on the government shutdown.. I had to hear someone preach about how ""we are not free"" because ""the government shut us out of the parks, they are in control of us taking a walk in the woods, #openyoureyes"". Yes the shutdown was preventable and it sucked, but at the time, NONESSENTIAL parts of the government needed to be shut down. Parks are nonessential. ""Well we should still be able to go in"", no, because there is a rather large population of idiots that would go fuck with everything I'm the parks if the rangers and what not weren't there. People forget that the general population can be very dumb.

People who assume that just because they are of a certain gender, ethnicity, etc. that they get a free pass to be assholes.
This is more specific to me, but anything that reminds me of my grandfather.  This guy was the most ignorant, intollerant, arrogant ass i've ever known.  Me and my younger brother went to work for him on his ranch once, and he constantly did things that put us in direct danger just cause he couldn't be bothered to think.  If we were riding in the back of his truck to hold something down, he would just back us into a pine tree.  I can understand that he's not that bright, but the worst part was when he attacked my brother.  He can take care of himself because he used to be on the wrestling team (and was pretty good i might add), but when my grandad did that, I found out what it actually means to hate someone.  My brother didn't fight back, and neither did I, but if I were to see him today, I wouldn't even stop to say hello.  He'd be on the ground.
Aggressive hugging. I'm a 25 year old male and I still have friends whom I see all the time that will make a spectacle out of greeting me in public. As in running up, shouting, hugging, and lifting me up into the air.

"When people are unnecessarily rude to cashiers. 

Also when people take phone calls when checking out... But I guess these go hand in hand."
This fucking guy who shares a wall with my office.  He works for another company and sounds European.  When he's not yelling on the phone, he is CONSTANTLY drumming on his desk.  I don't even think he has music playing because I would be able to hear it.  The second I hear that noise of the hand hitting the desk it throws me into rage.  I am normally impossible to get a rise out of.
Random people who make snarky remarks to me over the Internet when someone has a question about something. If you look up any question on google you will find a bunch of sassy remarks sandwiched between the answer to your question.

When I see people 'speeding' in the left lane but never move over to the right even when its empty. If they're going like a hundred...while dangerous I find this more acceptable than doing 72 and just continually cruising and never moving over. Wtf.

Second of all, homophobia. Just... just why? Why do you care so fucking much about what someone else's sexuality is? Are you afraid gays are going to try to molest you if you get too close to them or something? Because, surprise surprise, 99.9% of the time, that assumption will be horrendously wrong. God, even talking about it gets me heated..."

When gay people act super flamboyant and loud and annoying, yet expect everyone to be okay with it because they're gay, and getting mad would be perceived as homophobic. I have no problem with gay people and their sexuality, but when they want to be treated equally, act like an idiot, then play the 'homophobia card', I lose it.

But the guy is such a tool.

 I was hired to replace him and he was moved to an other department. since I been here 90% of my job is to fix the cluster fuck he made of the IT Network/server infrastructure.Add that to the non stop whistling and my blood just boils when I see him. he wasn't fired be cause he has been with the company for like 25 years and is the only place he has ever worked at.

"When I'm on the internet or in real life, and I see people STILL arguing over things that will never be concluded and just do not matter.Well I feel more pity, but also anger. 

Me and two friends went camping, and one of my friends (Quentin) hasn't lived on the internet like me and the other friend (Tarquin) (god i love making up names) has. Quentin started to go on about religion and how 'christianity is just fucking bullshit and harmful' and The Crusades and whatnot. Me and Tarquin just looked at each other, looked back and said 'You know Quentin, we used to be a lot like you when we were 15'. He's a cool dude but when you listen to shit from internet commenters for long enough, you realise how futile these petty arguments are.

I also have an internet friend on an IRC group I use. All of his conversations are spiteful hatred towards Black people, Women and Capcom. One day everyone just turned on him. Not because of his opinions but because of how repetitive and pointless his opinions were.

"Animal abuse- more specifically, dogs. 
How someone can intentionally hurt a creature so loyal, loving, and innocent is just beyond me. Dogs are such selfless creatures who trust us to take care of them and love them, and for people to beat them and starve them makes me madder than anything. 

Going off that topic, puppy mills piss me the fuck off too. Horrible, money hungry people create these hell holes for poor mothers to simply churn out puppy after puppy to sell to pet stores. These mothers are kept in cages too tiny to stand in and are neglected, beaten, starved, and aren't even given a name. These dogs are baby making factories and nothing else. I've fostered dogs that come from these puppy mills and it is just the saddest thing in the world. It took us about a year just to be able to give one of our puppy-mill rescues a few pats on the back. She was terrified of anything and everything, and when we finally got her to the point where she was domesticated and loving, we saw her true colors. Sweetest dog ever, wanted nothing more to love and be loved, yet she was treated like garbage for most of her life.

"The logic behind ""bad words"". If someone asks me to watch my language in a public place with only mature ears around (15-16 + years old; they're hearing it already, why should I pretend otherwise?), everything else falls away and I get angry.

But any slight change toward a list of pretermined ""curses"" makes me unintellegent, immature and rude.

I just don't understand it. Set a god damn alarm thats loud enough to wake you up the first time. Don't hit snooze, you set it for a reason so get up. Don't turn it off and lay there and accidentally fall back asleep and be an hour late while I'm standing on the street waiting for a god damn ride and you won't answer your phone and now we're late for work, just sit the fuck up, start your fucking day.

Go to bed early enough so that you're not tired. Personally I feel rested after about 8-9 hours of sleep so if I have to wake up at 5:30am, I go to bed at 8:30 - 9pm. It's not hard.


Aside from the morning thing, people who are chronically late piss me off. How hard is it to gauge time? Unless it's someplace completely new to you, you should know approximately how long it'll take you to first get ready and secondly actually get there. Plus, if you're going to be late, warn people. If I'm going to be 20 minutes late because there was an accident and now I'm being detoured slowly, I'll send a quick text or call when I get the chance to let the person who's expecting me know.

I had to wash my hands one too many times at work because I was trying to organize some cabling that was really dusty and dirty and the fucker sprang up and would cause more pain than I imagined a little tear in my finger's skin could cause.  The relief I experienced after trimming that bastard was awesome."
Cheating on your SO, don't care who does it really, and especially hate the way its often portrayed in movies and literature.
Touch MY radio in MY car when I am driving listening to MY music and you will see a side of me you have never seen before.
"These kids going on about how awful their lies are when the worst thing that has happened in their life is that their Xbox was taken away for the weekend when the people they are complaining to have actual problems (most likely PTSD after tragic events) that they keep quiet about. 

Pisses me off so bad I swear steam comes out my ears. "
Having to update A MILLION PROGRAMS everytime I turn on my laptop. Especially when they require restarting the computer.
Black people on Hardcore Pawn, people who say 'praise Jesus', anyone who voted for Obama just because he's black, parents with fat kids, fat parents, family friendly sitcoms, mainstream animation for the last 15 years (minus adventure time, boondocks, futurama, and superjail), the fact that some people think Titanic was just a movie, anyone who thinks the last 3 star wars movies were worth watching let alone good, affleck is the new Batman, mushrooms and olives, that kid in AIT on Ft. Gordon who would put a Krispy Kreme donuts in a bowl, drown it in maple syrup and eat it with a fork, Real Tree camo, white rimmed sunglasses and all the douchefucks who wear them. 
"Thinking about my sexual assault and how cruel the detectives where to me and how little was done about all of it.

A kid who stole a fucking wallet has a worse criminal record than the kid that sexually assaulted me?! WHAT. THE. FUCK."
Watching people use the scooters at walmart simply because they are too fat and lazy to walk around the store and having apparently nothing to do with an injury. 
When people chew. Not even with there mouths open, but when they're closed. I can hear the crunch of food in there mouth and it just gets me so angry beyond content.
Someone poking my chest with their finger as if they are putting me in my place. I discovered this about myself when it almost caused a brawl in my driveway just yesterday morning.
When people leave the sink running while they brush their teeth. I didn't realize people were still ignorant enough to do this until living in a dorm. You see more often than you'd think.
"Two things,
1)When people don't make eye contact with me when I am talking to them.
2)When I am having a serious conversation with a group of people and someone who is not part of the conversation interrupts us with some stupid shit that has nothing to do with what we are talking about(i.e ""Look what Bobby just texted me"" or ""I am sooooo hungry right now"")

old people that hold up the grocery store line to babble smalltalk to the clerk because they are lonely. hey you are welcome to spend your last days however you like but taking up my time is not going to be on the table. i immediately speak up when this happens. 
When someone spoils the ending of a movie. I mean shit, if I wanted to fucking know I'd fucking look it up my self. I get pissed thinking about it o_o
People who drive the wrong way down one way lanes in parking lots. I've never wanted to behead someone so badly in my life.......
This girl I know thinks there's such a thing as a playful tap to the nuts. There's not. It fucking hurts. I'm titty punching her next time.
When I'm listening to music and my earphone cords get yanked by whatever object is nearby, no matter my mood or where I am I just want to kick someone as hard as possible just to take it out on something. 
Seeing people steal. I'm paying fair and square for the shit that you're just walking out. No body gets a free pass in life 
The thought of my ex-best friend and my ex-girlfriend( i still have feelings for her) hooking up. He likes her.
"People who drive the speed limit in THE LEFTMOST FUCKING LANE!

"I work as registration in the local ER here in Fort Myers FL. I'm not racist or anything but the second somebody comes up to my check-in window and says "" You Speaky Spaneesh""? I get this internal rage that I cant explain."
"Animal abuse. First thing that came to mind.   
Also, when people talk over music I'm listening to, or interrupt me in the middle of a video game (especially online/multiplayer) and tell me to ""just pause it!""  
Also also, that drop of water that runs down your sleeve if you lift your hands before drying them."
"When someone has a surplus of something like a big bag of skittles and they are so selfish that that won't even share a single one. Really irritates me. When I have things like that I'm the one who offers it to others. "
"When people who im driving around try to comment on my driving and give me tips and tell me how to drive.
No just shutup and sit yo ass down!
Seriously annoys me so much."
I live in an apartment where we have two lifts. If both happen to be busy, with one on 29 and one on 30 it pisses me off to no end. Why don't they make these things slightly more intelligent 
Drunk selfish people who burn PALLETS at bonfires!!!  Future horrible days at the beach for helpless squishy feet.
Catered lunches at work where the sandwiches are pre-mayo'd. I hate mayo and never understand why they can't just put the mayo on the side. 
"There is nothing on this planet that makes me angry as quickly or as much as when a parent belittles their child for drawing or showing any sign of wanting to be an artist.
Really any act that would discourage someone from expressing their creativity makes me mad, but art and children just throws a perfect storm of emotions my way.
I've briefly flashed red just from reading this situation in a book. I don't know what I'd do if I saw this IRL."
"My girlfriend breaking up with me over text out of the blue.She cheated on me the whole time.With one of my ""friends"".This happened 3 minutes ago."
People who talk down on me/act like I'm stupid. I think I'm a fairly smart person. Not super smart. But we all have our bad days. Also being called things like darling/hunny/
50 Shades of Grey. I will rant for a good hour about how full of crap it is. It infuriates me so intensely. 
When I pour my cereal and then absentmindedly pour in the milk, only there isn't enough milk for the bowl..only a few drops, but now that I've wet the cereal I can't save it til I have more milk.Nope I have to throw this delicious bowl of crunchy toasted mouth yums into the bin. Makes me fuckin mad. Mad like I want to rip the curtains down and throw my couch out of my bedroom window. >:( 
When people have no subtlety or concern in talking about serious matters. I was reeling and woozy at a deafeningly loud party last summer due to allergies and sleep disorders, snd someone had the balls to say I was being a buzzkill and should really start dancing. No, the problem is I slept 2 hours out of the past 48 and can barely breathe. 
"I have a friend, who's a great guy, but as soon as he gets a girlfriend I get pissed off because he always breaks up with them because he ""isn't good enough."""
When someone chews their nails really loud. What are you even doing? I bite my nails but it's only when they are long and bugging me. It's totally silent. The sound of nail on teeth...it drives me nuts.
I don't want to play Candy Crush with you. You should have gotten the idea the first time I fucking ignored you!
Bad driving. Poor spelling/grammar. Bathrooms that smell like poo. Animal abuse. The thought of how much influence religion has in world affairs. I could go on for days.
People who always talk about God. Cool, I believe in God too but I don't talk about him 24/7 and then when Atheists hear someone mention God then change topics really fast, sometimes they go off on them and it's annoying. (I mean a handful of people go off like that but it's really annoying)
Well, I was going to say racism and other forms of willful ignorance, but I guess hitting your head is good too.
"Hearing people sneezing, or coughing. I have no idea why, but after hearing the third or fourth, I begin to boil.

"I realize I'm a bite late, but I hope people with children see this. 

When I see children improperly put in their car-seats.

These are your children, you need to know how to put them in a seat that will (hopefully) save their lives if you're in an accident.

I always see kids in their giant winter coats, loosely buckled in. DO NOT put a child in a seat with a heavy coat on. In the case of an accident, that coat will compress, leaving the straps loose and your child will slip right out the top.

The chest clip needs to be on the CHEST, between the nipples/armpit level. I always see that chest clip on their bellies. It's a called a ""chest clip"" for a reason.

The straps should be snug enough on your child so you're not able to pinch any slack in the strap.

A lot of the time, people argue that their child is too large to continue rear facing. ""His legs are too long!"" ""She would hate it!"" The child can cross their legs, s/he is not too big (I'm talking about 4 year olds & under, roughly). The best way to say it is ""Would you rather them have broken legs, or broken necks? You can fix broken legs, but broken necks are often fatal.""

People who speed through school zones. You know a child. And I know that you know how mad you would be if the kid you know got hit by some ass hole speeding through school zones. 
Seeing a yellow car induces instant road rage.  I don't know why.  Taxis and school busses are exempt for some reason.
"People waking me up on the weekends. I am quite busy during the week so ill usually sleep in until 1-2 on saturday and sunday. I have trouble sleeping so once I'm up I can't fall back asleep.

Nothing is more infuriating than my mom waking me up at 6 to ask, ""Wheres the coffee creamer?""  "
"If I put a pencil down on a table, and it rolls off, and when I pick it up and  put it back on the table, and it ROLLS OFF AGAIN!  I freak the fuck out!

Also, when the bus driver asks over the speaker for people to move back and make room, MOVE THE FUCK BACK!  Yeah, you, fuckface who is not moving back, he's talking to you.  Why the fuck you still standing there? make room, dickhead!  Everybody just wants to get home, and you can't move out of your preferred spot?  Fuck you."
"I'm quite a laid back girl, but I have this guy on facebook that I've recently noticed has turned into complete douchebag. I was friends with him at school, he seemed alright, if not slightly strange. We fell out of touch and haven't spoken for around 5 years. I went on facebook for the first time in a *long* time and browsed my old school buddies profiles, including this guy. 

Oh my lordy lord.  

""University/college destroys education."" (He dropped out of school at 15 to start a shitty band that's going nowhere, as far as I can tell and hasn't done anything else since. He doesn't have a job, saying that ""his music will pay for stuff when I'm famous."" This guy is 20! He's stated he's going to be the next ""John Lennon"" on numerous occasions and brags constantly. Just no.)

""Insanity is normailty."" (Trying to profound and deep. Ergh.)

""I want a real woman in my life, not girls who wear make-up and drink all the time."" (His definition of what a ""real"" woman is is laughable. He has also posted several creepy statuses about following girls in the street back to their houses, something he's been called out on by people often. He also devoutly believes in all the friendzoning bullcrap and that women ignore the ""nice guys."" Ergh. He really thinks he's a nice guy. )

""Weed smokers are better people in general, because weed makes you smarter."" (He can't spell for shit and dropped out of school. Go figure.)


He's said countless other ridiculous things that have made me seethe. 

He was such a sweet kid in school, it's so hard to believe that he's such an arrogant, conceited, snooty little asswipe.

I deleted him."
Bullying...I would punch out the the incredible fucking Hulk if he was bullying someone.  Also, people/objects in my way and people being dicks on recreational sports teams.  Honorable mention: people being assholes to customer service people.
"You know when you're working with something sticky like tape and it gets on your hands, and instead of plucking it off with your free hand you flail it around violently trying to shake it off?

Here's my fist in your face."
Those 1 or 2 people you're friends with on facebook that only post song lyrics in their status updates, and they do it literally 3 times an hour so it takes up your entire news feed.  Like what, are you trying to seem like a deeper person by sounding like some poet and copy and pasting random song lyrics from some obscure artist that no one has never heard of?  Pisses me off to no end.
People laughing obnoxiously. Like, when it turns from a laugh to a straight up cackle. Makes me want to slaughter them.
"When the water in the shower gets cold.  I take very hot showers.  On the plus side, I just discovered after living in this house for two years that the hot water heater was on ""vacation"" setting so it's only been heating about a tenth of the water. Don't have to worry about that anymore!"
When I take a shit and it's like I'm wiping a fucking marker. Bonus points when after I finally take care of it I have to shit some more.
"Have a list!
1. FUCKING PEOPLE WHO DECIDE TO STOP AND HAVE A CONVERSATION IN A DOORWAY. DO YOU NOT HAVE THE COMMITMENT TO ENTER THE ROOM?
2. PEOPLE THAT WAIT IN LINE FOR 10 MINUTES AND THEN DON'T KNOW WHAT TO ORDER/SEE AT THE THEATRE
3. ORANGES THAT GO BAD ON ONE SIDE BUT ARE FINE ON THE TOP. DON'T PLAY ME LIKE THAT
4. OVERLY SEXUAL COUPLES IN FUCKING PUBLIC
5. GOD DAMN IPHONES IN FUCKING EVERYONE'S HAND ALL THE TIME
6. FUCKING ICE CREAM CONES BEING TIME BOMBS
7. LONG FUCKING INTRODUCTIONS"
When people in the back of the classroom have a question for the instructor, and they speak at a low volume. Right when the teacher asks them to repeat themselves they continue with the same decibel they were talking in from the star. UGH! 
Someone complaining about the same problem over and over again.  Once is fine,  second I'll let it pass,  but the third time is goin make me smack you in the face. 
"Bullying. I know, it's pretty cliche; everyone hates bullying to some extent (I think..) but every time it comes up in conversation or just in general I get so heated. 

That's someones child. They watched them grow up from a tiny baby to who they are today, and the fact that some people stoop so low as to make fun of them because of the way they look, act, dress, etc. is so disgusting to me I can't help but get mad thinking about it. "
It seriously pisses me off to no end when someone tries to mess with my family. It's been happening a lot recently to my older sister and she doesn't care at all(good for her I guess) but I hate it. 
waiting on someone, i can be cussed at, threatened whatever and not lose my cool. but if im meeting you somewhere at 2 and its 215 im unreasonably angry 
Slamming one of my fingers into a door or a drawer on accident , I feel like I could seriously strangle a small animal. I still have a mark on my finger from slamming it closed into my locker in HS. 
When people tap on my shoulder instead of saying my name or something similar to get my attention, my instant reflex is to smack their hand away immediately.  Oh my god I hate that so much.
"Being told to ""chill out"". If I'm just mildly frustrated is like pouring gasoline on a fire, but if I'm already angry its like chucking a stick of dynamite in a furnace.

"
A young woman gives a kid a balloon it's a nice gesture. A young man gives a kid a balloon and he's labeled as a pedophile.
People who literally drive in front of you down a one way road under speed limit when you're trying to get somewhere.... then hit the gas when the light turns yellow. I sit at the red light pretty angry every time this happens....
"People who refuse to vaccinate their kids because vaccines might cause autism. 

These people are basically saying ""I would rather your baby die of measles than my child have autism.""  

EVEN IF there was any credible research showing that vaccines cause autism in some children, I think all parents who refuse to vaccinate for that reason should be forced to look the parents of children who died of diseases prevented by vaccines in the eye and say ""Yes, forgoing a 1% change that my child might get autism was worth your child's death."""
The fact that when myself and about 50 other students are wandering around to find a computer to work on in the student library, about 20% of people using them are watching youtube
"One of my coworkers gets absolutely furious when you call a lectern a podium and will go on a long rant every time someone does it. One of the first days at work I had to follow him around and we went into a classroom and he stops me and pointing to a lectern he asks me, ""What is this?"", and then proceeds to stop me before I answer and gives a preemptive short rant about how people screw it up all the time and never to make that mistake. 
"
when people don't use their goddamn turn signals! Also when Southern drivers are completely confused by how a roundabout works
People who don't get out of the way and stop when an ambulance or fire truck has sirens or lights going. 
"When strangers come up to me and ask me what's wrong with my face. I have a scar after having surgery to get a tumor removed. Fuck off. 

When people debate about politics and they don't agree with each other and people say things such as ""typical left wing liberal hippie bullshit"" or ""of course your disgusting asshole Republican views."" Have a fucking debate without having to insult one another."
"Salespeople who remain pushy after you say no.

A guy at the supermarket today started trying to talk to me about prescription drugs. I smiled and said ""I don't take any drugs"" and walked away, but he followed me and said ""well do you have any pets?"
"People with noticeably high levels of dandruff who in public area continually scratch their heads.

dandruff in my face? urgh enrages me. "
Animal cruelty. Poaching. One of the first posts I commented on when new to Reddit earlier this year was a very graphic photo of a dead elephant, sitting upright and leaning over forward with his head down, tusks gone and a pool of blood under him. I'm ready to kill instantly.
For some reason I see certain people and become instantly enraged. I have no reason to hate them but at the same time I want to punch them in the face.
Being pinched. Doesn't matter where, and it bothers me that such a simple gesture can hurt so fucking bad. Unparalleled rage will indefinitely follow
"I have anxiety attacks and the best way to get me BOILING WITH RAGE on top of shitting my pants with panic is to tell me to ""calm down"" ""stop freaking out"", ""you're being irrational"", etc. HOLY SHIT. IF ONLY I HAD THOUGHT OF CALMING DOWN. Man, you just saved me a lifetime of meds and therapy by pointing out that I could just STOP and he ""RATIONAL"". Thank you. I have LITERALLY never tried calming down before moving streight to panic-barfing. Fuck."
When anybody reasons everything with Jesus or God like I'm a religion tolerant man but just shut the fuck up
"If I see you strike your kid in front of me with almost no justification and/or with what I deem unnecessary force, whether in public or your private home, I will prevent you from touching that kid EVER again and you will probably have to have your shoulder popped back in as I ""defend them from another abusive attack"". 

I've only had to do this once when a grown man hit his 5 year old multiple times for running away in the store with a toy the kid liked. I dislocated his finger performing a wrist hold while telling someone to get security and call the cops."
PETA, MotherFucking People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals the only thing they are here for is for whoring money out of idiotic people that think what they are doing is just! And to top it off they are basically terrorists! They destroy the property of people that go against their ways. . .I hate people that agree with PETA.
Accusing people of ill intent when you live, work or otherwise interact with them, and know this not to be true. This turns me from zero to full on rage.
"People who can't merge in traffic. PEOPLE: If you are merging onto a freaking interstate, YOU CAN'T MERGE AT 35 MPH. SPEED THE HELL UP.

Im getting angry just thinking about it."
I hang out in the QUIET lounge between classes. Everyone in the room is silently studying, doing homework or on their computers. Then sometimes there will be two people whispering to each other. In this room it doesn't matter how quietly you whisper, everyone else can hear you since the room is so quiet. On top of that this one jackass is dropping the word fuck between every single word, saying fucking like most people would pause or use the word 'um' during a conversation. They are the only people in the room talking, why the hell can't they go out in the hallway? It makes me beyond angry
"I'm sure it's been said but...

IF YOU'RE BEING PASSED ON THE RIGHT (in right-hand side driving countries) GET THE FUCK OVER.

Seriously, the left lane is for the people who drive better than you. I don't care your age, your vehicle, or what your bumper sticker says.

I'll cut you....Off."
The wearing of sweatpants/pajamas in public, and the wearing of flip flops in weather or locations that aren't appropriate. Granted, I think there's only two appropriate uses for them (freshman dorm room showers and walking from your car to the sand at the beach). 
When people are cruel just for shits and giggles.To animals or people. Whenever I see that happening, I just get so enraged that the Incredible Hulk himself would tell me to chill the fuck out.
"Litter, people who litter or even just don't throw their trash away after lunch (high school) are just the worst. They're saying ""I don't give a shit about anyone else, I'm more important than them!"" Many high school students are arrogant little pricks with no respect for adults or other people in general."
When people shush me I get pretty angry, I hate that. Oh and if I'm ever playing beer pong and someone refuses the Gentleman's Eye...well that's just not a pretty sight afterwards.
When one of my employees ask for help and I do it and 2 minutes later they are fucking off.  I have few rules I live by. One of them is to never EVER ask for someone else's help if I am fully capable of doing it myself.
"Mature age students.. who insist that we wouldn't understand because of ""their life experience""
I get it. congratulations on going back and studying, it really is something to be proud of, but don't overcompensate by being a smug wanker- and try to bond with a lecturer on a level that ""we wouldn't understand"". "
"People who post shit on Facebook, non-stop. By shit, I'm referring to:
1. Inspirational quotes on pictures. Yep, awesome. How about balancing that out with some original thoughts of your own, too?
2. Anything religious. Or atheist. Nobody cares. 
3. ""Like this or little Jimmy won't get his heart transplant"", ""Like if you think she's beautiful"", ""Like and the picture changes"". Yeah, fuck off with this crap. 
4. ""Vaguebookers"". Idiots who post, minus details, so everyone asks what actually happened. Fuck right off before I finish yawning. "
People who insist on arguing about subjects they are clearly uneducated in. You know they look and sound like an idiot, but they are usually so belligerent about whatever moronic point they are trying to make that I just back down and let them take the win, making me look like the dickhead.
When people waste money on unnecessary things. I am 17 years old but I think that I am more corcened than my parents about the things that we buy. For example, my mom spends money on junk food for my brothers, I am not fat, neither my brothers but everytime we are doing the groceries she insists in buying chocolate chips, cookies, candies, etc. My father is another example, he always needs to have the new trending phone. If the new iphone X is released, he buys it, if the new Samsung Galaxy S 1,000,000 is released he buys it and so on.
"When people bail on plans or change them last minute for the most avoidable reason. I just get absolutely infuriated because that person isn't considering anyone else at all. I've found that in college I've had to pretty much make plans with two groups of people on Friday/Saturday nights to not end up on my couch doing nothing. ""Oh hey yeah I know we said we'd meet up at 5 but I'm going to grab a shower and play CoD so let's make it 10"" -_- that and when the excuse is ""I'm too high, can't hangout""..... errrr grumble grumble grumble"
"Seeing my ex.


Also having to wait ten minutes between comments because I joined Reddit three days ago."
A lot of the shit I see on the internet. If only i didn't care so much about reading comments to see what other people thought.
Thinking about the zero-tolerance bullying policy in my school district. It is beyond unfair and makes students afraid to defend themselves.
"People with hairpin triggers and zero class.  Like you ask them to put their dog on a leash and its ""fuck you fucker why don't I kick your ass!"".  Usually its middle aged, overweight white trash women who [think their protected.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZxJ8RKxPWQ) "
"Mouth sounds as people eat  or drink unless I am also eating or drinking at the same time. (usually I eat alone because my intense hatred of the sounds makes me sensitive to my own mouth noises)

All someone has to do is chew their food without closing their mouth for me to have to leave the room. I had to leave work early because my boss was eating something loudly. It rages me just thinking about it."
Hypocrites irritate the hell out of me. Can't stand when I get told at work not to do something. Then ten minutes later they're doing the same damn thing I was. 
People who think everything is an opinion and whoever argues best decides what's true.  I've met a few and it appals me that this is a thing.
"When an asian says they can tell what kind of asian someone is soley based on appearence because all asians are different and anyone who says different is racist because its implying ""they all look the same"".   BULL FUCKING SHIT.  All east asians share a common genetic lineage and thus DO, in fact, all look the same."
"People who go out of their way to let another person know that they understood a reference. Why do you have to make an entire thread on reddit about ""lol DAE DR WHO REFERENCE DALEK"" yeah we fucking get it. You watch one of the most popular science fiction television series of all time. Got it.

When people don't like popular things for the simple reason that it's popular. Usually if a lot of people are buying something or watching a movie its for a reason."
Bullying combined with the Zero tolerance rule. I was bullied as a kid and I eventually snapped back at him and ended up suspended. Pissed both me and my parents off. Beating the living crap out of Kenny was a good day though. 
People who shout for and call for wars, who have no idea what war is, and what its like to be a civilian during a war.
"People who can't show up on time, or are always late

And, I can't say this is a common thing, 
but today in class a kid asked the teacher to repeat something he said, and it kept happening over and over again. I look over and the fucker has earphones in while he's asking questions."
Skinny guys making fun of chubby guys. I'm not skinny or fat myself, but there's just something about it that makes me want to crush that guy's scrawny bones. 
I had to explain to a senior in high school that the earth rotates on an axis AND revolves around the sun. Also that the earth was on a slight tilt and that's why we have seasons and differing hours of sunlight. She was so amazed by such a simple set of concepts. 
"When teachers assign group PAPERS. 
Because you know what that equates to? 
Being paired with three other incompetent fucking writers. Even if I can miraculously get them ALL to do their share of the paper, it comes back horribly written. Even if they're ALL gloriously written (which never happens) it won't be cohesive, so I'll still end up having to rewrite half of it. "
When assholes step up to a counter after standing in line for five minutes and they still have no fucking idea what they want to order. And then they start ordering shit not on the menu or customize an order beyond recognition.
I've seen multiple other people say it but I'll add my hand in for hitting my head. I am incredibly mellow, it is nearly impossible to get me into a fury but hitting my head...I literally see read, I will punch fucking holes through what ever I hit my head on with no regard to the scene I may be making or damage I'm causing. Once the pain subsides it's like I come back to reality and be profoundly embarrassed. Seriously, almost nothing else makes me immediately angry at all, ever.
"Getting spanked or having water flicked at me. I don't mean a proper spanking but you know when a buddy walks by and slaps you on the ass. I hate that shit. 
The water one is more petty, for whatever reason i just see red. It's so disrespectful yet so simple."
Having to repeat myself over and over again. It annoys the hell out of me when some keeps asking me the same exact question 4 or 5 times. It makes me think they don't listen to me when i tell them.
When ever I have a dream where I am falling and move my limbs to brace myself only to awkwardly fidget in my bed, really pisses me off.
"Animal abuse, blue-balls, hipsters, incompetence, willful ignorance, the words/phrases ""hella"" and ""yolo"", Piers Morgan, unsalted nuts, diet coke, and family gatherings."
When people don't answer your questions and then get mad at you when you don't answer their questions.
When a lane of traffic is busy and you see someone speed past and chuck on their indicator at the last second to merge in... Makes me rage hard!

When somebody asks for your opinion on a problem, then doesn't like the response and proceeds to argue with me. If they didn't want my opinion why did they both fucking ask for it?

I remember this one time I borrowed my brother's truck to go camping with my friends and his USB stick with his music was plugged in to his radio. We were listening to it and my friend comments how my brother has better taste in music than I do. I had to use a huge amount much restraint not to throw my fucking friend out of the truck and leave him in the middle of nowhere.

That tone that plays before messages at the grocery store, you know the one. The second I hear it im absolutely furious. Its the same tone as my alarm clock so it just sturs deep hatred.
Inauthentic people really get to me. If you're going to live life, why not be yourself. I have a fucking for these kind of people and can't stand them. I try to give people my best shit, but sometimes you can tell it's not really them and I hate it.

And it's situations like the example why I don't like apologies.

"**My 10 year old cousin is morbidly obese, and has been since she was 3.**

I don't know what the exact numbers are for her weight, but I know that I'm a 23 year old man in athletic shape, and she's been heavier than me for YEARS.

Before anyone starts, no, there's no glandular problem, this is no disease, it's her mother. Her goddamn mother, my cousin, used to honestly be very thin, but somewhere just before the pregnancy she just ""accepted her body image"" or some other philosophical (not necessarily bad, I freely admit) thing, and she just ballooned. And now, while not a bad person, she definitely uses food to babysit her daughter. It shows not just in the girl's body; the child can't hold a conversation longer than three minutes without mentioning food. Another fun response is that she can't be obese, she dances; look, I don't know what to tell you woman, but your daughter is LITERALLY THREE TIMES THE SIZE of the other girls in her troupe. If you think her dancing will save her, I agree, but not whatever she's doing, because it's clearly NOT working.

Problem is, I'm young, and in my family I can't just call her out like she needs to be called out. So I'm stuck watching my younger cousin expand into an actual land whale. I know the terms are disrespectful, and I of course have nothing personal against overweight people- I understand it can be difficult to reverse lifestyles that get you to that point. But we're talking about a *kid* here. God dammit, if (and sadly, it's probably more of a *when)* that child has *a fucking heart attack* before she reaches *high school,* there is an EXTREMELY good chance I will get very, very verbally abusive, if not actually violent, with her mother.

*Rant over until I see that poor girl again*"
"Elderly abuse.

I have worked many years in facilities and independent living facilities. I always got a great sense of justice when I could prove a family member was being abusive (in any way) and have them either removed as POA or banned from the facility or whatever awesome justice came round. 

Sadly, many many times I could not prove it and those are the times I would hate humanity."
Thieves. Even if I'm not the victim; it's the fact someone is scumbag enough to steal something what belongs to other's.
"When black people call me ""nigga"". If you don't want me to use that word, don't say it to me. Sometimes I feel like they do it just to see if I'll say it back, or hold it over my head somehow, like ""haha you can't say this word and if you do I'll whoop your ass."""
People who stop right at the fucking top or bottom of escalators to, you know, have a leisurely gander and get their bearings.
People getting ready to leave class and making a fuckload of noise. While the professor is still teaching. Seriously. Rude. 
Conspiracy theorists.  The moment they bring something like that up, I rage.  Especially the fluoride-in-the-water-is-dumbing-us-down bullshit.

People acting as though I'm a threat to them or others because I'm a man. Because it is difficult sometimes to know their reason, I usually let it go. But if someone actually expresses it is because I am a man, I'm sure to get upset (in a non-threatening manner).
"Whenever anyone mentions the autism vaccine ""thing"". The sheer stupidity, ignorance and vitriolic bile spewed by its proponents makes me wish for a lobotomy."

Anyone who is politically bias. There are obviously things wrong with both political parties. Why not have the good qualities of both?
"When people say ""God has a plan"". I'm not normally a militant atheist or anything, and people are free to believe what they want so long as it doesn't have too big an impact on me, but when those words slip past their lips I get incredibly angry. I think I hate it so much because if everything that happens is part of God's plan, then it's a plan that (at best) involves not lifting a finger while people are raped and murdered. And when people say to me, in a moment of personal strategy, ""God has a plan"", I just want to punch their teeth in. If there's a god, and his plan involved killing my best friend, then fuck him and anyone that thinks this plan is worth anything."
When my slutty-ass roommate flirts with the guys I am into.. She's fucked 3 of them that I brought home so far. Bitch.

Most people apparently have no empathy for other people, and get angry when someone doesn't act like they want.

"When people use real life situations as an excuse to act in a certain way or do certain things.

My boyfriend does this a lot. For example: We are typically health conscious (he is diabetic) when it comes to food and things we eat/drink. I do it for him so he doesn't feel alone when he has to turn certain things down. He had a colonoscopy done then afterward wanted KFC. I don't eat there so I suggested something else. Then he goes ""Come on Intergalactic_Yoni, I just had surgery I think I deserve something.""

Like, fuck the fuck off you fucking pansy get the fuck over it and grow up. I don't care how many doctors shove their fingers in your ass, don't fucking use it as an excuse to get whatever you want."
"A total lack of empathy. 

It's bad enough to be selfish and to always focus on *nothing* but one's self but when someone is structured to not even realize that they are acting selfishly I just blow my top. People that use others as stepping stones without ever asking for or acknowledging their devotion makes me want to shake them into ~~my~~ reality."

Victim blamers and sexual abuse. It's just come to the point that if an article looks like it might be about rape or sexual assault, I won't open it, just for the sake of my blood pressure. It just makes me hate the world.

When I'm walking somewhere with a person, and I know where we're going, but they don't, and they feel the need to either walk ahead of you or do that invisible steering thing where they walk a little close to you to make you start going in a slightly different direction. Holy fuck, dude. I know where we're going. You don't. You asked me to show you where to go, stop trying to guide me. And in the same vein, when a person has to walk right next to you even when you're walking through tight spaces, and then you try to get in front of or behind the person and they ruin it. Just. Fuck, man. Kinda ruins my day.

Petty arguments in class. I was in a writing workshop where two goons argued over a choice of font for ten minutes. 
"Denial of scientific/historical facts, even when presented with overwhelming evidence.

Instead, we get ""the bible says so"", ""look at this (thoroughly flawed and disproved) study, and I don't even know what retarded argument holocaust deniers use. Of course, the underlying issue is poor education and the related problems of anti-intellectualism and glorification of ignorance. Also, journalists are not held to any standards. There should fines and prison sentences given for purposely spreading misinformation."
"Salesman who demand rather than ask.

Well, I don't want to open up a can of worms here, but in all honesty, Feminism. To be more clear,  feminism as it is in the modern world. 
Screaming kids in a restaurant.  Or anywhere for that matter.  Get a fucking baby sitter or stay home.  No one thinks your kid is cute.
"- The phrase ""that's not true"" aka being called out every time you speak. I have a friend that does this every time I have discussion over news, history, etc. with him, it's the most fucking annoying thing ever. Especially when it's over a topic I've researched extensively.
 
- Patronizing me in front of others
 
- Sounds that disturb my misophonia - chewing loud, smacking, or breathing loud in a quiet room

"My mother-in-law-to-be.

I'm living in her house with my fiance, she's a live-in carer so she's not there most of the time. She came back yesterday. She said that she wanted the heating on for more than our current setting, 1hr morning and evening, because she needs it warmer. So we said ""okay, change the settings to whatever you want"". She said ""no"". Then she complained about how she didn't want the pipes to burst (when it's not once got cold enough for that here this autumn yet, and when it does start getting colder, we'll have the heating on more). We agreed we wouldn't let the pipes burst. She kept berating us for not having the heating on long enough for another ten minutes after that, until we literally walked away.

The kicker is, the boiler broke down last night. Now we have no heating or hot water, and since it tripped the electricity we've got to reset the clocks on the microwave and cooker - which we'd already had to reset once because she turned them off at the mains."

"When teachers who have had to tragically sacrifice themselves to save their students are hailed as heroes. No! They are incredibly brave victims, too.

Each time she kept interrupting me saying the exact same thing, ""But I don't have email on my phone,"" almost proud that she didn't understand. Why buy a smartphone if you refuse to figure out how to use it?"
Yes! It infuriates me when people intentionally set up a mental block on learning something for themselves, when they're fully capable of doing so. I work in consumer electronics, and I can't stand people who claim to be illiterate when in truth they're being stubborn and ignorant. End rant. 
"My dad will tell me I'm doing something wrong after asking me for help with his laptop. ""YOU HAVE TO GO TO START THEN ALL PROGRAMS THEN ACCESSORIES TO GET TO THE CALCULATOR YOU CAN'T JUST CLICK ON THE SHORTCUT. I KNOW IT'S OPEN BUT YOU DID IT WRONG."""
To add to this, people who call you instantly to fix something that is out of your power to fix or something that will remedy itself over time.
My mom used to do this to me all the time. Eventually she admitted to me that she just wanted to talk to me. Could be same situation. 
I also like how half the time I dont know how to do it either.  I just figure it out by using the device.  I think some people are just afraid to start pushing buttons
Or at least people who won't even try before running to someone for help. You know how I learned how to do stuff? I fucked with things until I figured it out. New car, tv, or computer? Press all the buttons.
My little brother is like that. For ten years, I've been helping him. Now, I'm just being as condescending as possible. Plugging something in? Round block, round hole. Turning the TV to the correct input? Fucking READ THE MOTHERFUCKING INPUTS!
And conversely, people refuse to give you help even after you've tried, failed, and asked them nicely for it.
similarly, people who ask for advice, then don't take it.  then complain about their predicament.  then ask for advice.  then don't take it.
I have a technically challenged boss who is like this. He'll ask someone else to spend an hour of their time fixing something that he could have googled and done himself in 10 minutes.
"It's not so much the ""not figuring it out for themselves"" that gets me. It's the sheer apathy about learning when someone takes their time to show you.

If it happens again I would refuse to show her how to work the remote until she decides she actually wants to learn, then give her your undivided attention and care in teaching her."
This is my in laws. They ask us to fix EVERYTHING. They're Netflix account booted them out? They can't log back on, we have to drive and take time out of our schedules to go and fix it or we don't love them. 
"My ex used to do this. ""Can you help me carry groceries from the car?"", and then there's one bag that weighs 8 pounds. "
"My mom does this bullshit too. She can barely use her smartphone, iPad, computer and TV because any time she has an issue she has me fix it and totally ignores me when I tell her how to do it herself. Why buy this expensive shit if you won't learn to use it. 

One benefit I did get from her stubborn ignorance is she wanted to trade her MacBook Pro for my dell PC because mine looks more like her computer at work and she can use it better. "
I love helping people. Makes me feel useful. I will help you no matter what. Even if I have no idea too
"My mother's a VP at a fucking bank and didn't take her iPad out of the box for 3 MONTHS because she needed me to ""set it up for her."" "
"OMG I'm at work right now and I was in the supply cabinet, stacking staples and this woman walks in and opens the cabinet next to me, clearly labeled BANDAIDS, doesn't even LOOK in the cabinet and goes, ""Hey hon, where are the Bandaids?"" 

pissed me off so much. FUCKING LOOK ON YOUR OWN"
There are people who come into my store and do this, but they'll just ask for something that they know we have. For example, I had a guy come in, stand in the doorway for about 30 seconds, spin around at least twice, then ask me where he could find bottled water. Not in the fucking doorway, dipshit.

My son, who is only 4, has this tendency. It drives me crazy and I refuse to help him until he at least tries for himself (a legit attempt, not half-assed). He has to learn to do things for himself. I will not do everything for him. Now, if only grandmas would jump on that bandwagon...

I forgive my mum and stuff, an she learns anyway. But its when people are so god damn lazy they can't do any of their shit themselves. I was in a queue when a less bright girl started saying to my friend has he done her history assessment. Then he said he didn't have time to do two, so she started complaining and bitching about it. I got pretty annoyed at this, then her friends come in and she asks them to do it for her. I got mad at her and her friends did too. She copies EVERYTHING the person next to her does, and she likes to be stupid. It just fucking annoys me that she has the audacity to make other people do her work. 
I hate this... Someone in class was filling out a form and at the start of every question she turned to the person next to her and asked what it meant... YES WE LIVE IN THE UK STUPID, YOU DONT NEED TO CHECK! 
Our TV was one of those ones with only one single GIANT GLOWING FUCKING POWER BUTTON on the front. (The rest were on the side) My mom would still ask me to turn the TV on and off.

"My mom.. Walks into a store, first thing she does before looking around or walking or checking anything, ask someone ""do you know where ____ is?"" And throughout this process I've already walked in, seen the sign that says ""____ this way"" and started walking towards it. It doesn't happen everywhere (for example, she doesn't literally do this in every store. Just an example, and she's more likely to do it for asking for directions in public somewhere) "
Worst with computer-illiterate people. Since they know somebody who knows how to operate a computer, they never need to learn to how operate it. My sister texted me the other day looking for an alternative to Microsoft Word, I told her google drive, she texted back asking what it was. I did not respond. If youre not willing to google what google drive is, then I'm not helping you.

Edit: na fall asleep.  Thank you for the gold kind redditor with a sense of humor! "
Jeez this happens all the time. I get sleepy around 11 and decide to get ready for bed, but by 11:30 I'm wide awake, usually until at least 2.
Whenever I get to work in the morning, I'm super motivated to do things around my apartment and get errands done. As soon as I get off work and can now go do all that... nothing.
Stretch. For some reason stretching can be stimulating or relaxing depending on what your trying to do.
That's me right now. It's 2 AM and I have to get up at 7. Ugh, just get exhausted and fall asleep already, brain!
"I also have a love/hate relationship with sleep. Always had and most likely always will have. I read on reddit that there's some syndrom that makes your brain go ""Fuck sleeping"" when everyone else is sleeping. I probably have it. I mean *we as people* probably have it. It probably has something to do with our ancestors switching turns and doing night shifts when they were there doing whatever they did. You know, I remember as kid how I felt like I could run much faster when it's dark. There was no one taking time but I still think I did run faster after sunset"
I'm 9 1/2 months pregnant. This has been my life every day for he last two months. I'm exhausted all day and if I lay down I almost always fall asleep. But as soon as its time for bed, I have all the energy in the world. 
Oh my god this. I've been having so much trouble with this, I'm tired as hell after getting no sleep the night before, I go to bed at 11, get 3-4 hours and wake up, fully unsatisfied with this. Try and sleep all day, until I fall asleep at 1 when I'm meant to get up for class. God dammit 
I can fall asleep at 11pm any night except the night before my 840am recitation, then its either 6am or I'm pulling an all nighter. 
This doesn't quite fit me - I stay on the laptop until crazy hours, and then wonder why I feel dozy all day. When I do go to sleep after shutting off the laptop, it's pretty much instantaneous, although I'm pretty sure if I went to bed at anything like a sensible time, I would have similar issues.
"I'm never sure whether to be mad at the pain or my stupidity for usually hitting something. I agree though, it's a primitive kind of rage.
"
My family thinks I'm the only one in the world like this.  But it's a rage that's almost uncontrollable and completely out of character.  I feel I need to break something or throw it across the room after I hit my head and I have no idea why.  You're right, if it was my arm, I wouldn't feel that rage.  Wonder what causes this??
"This actually happened to me the other day.

Was playing paintball, and a shot went right above my mask line, hitting me smack in the middle of my fucking forehead.

Hurt like a bitch, I barely remember my stream of cursing and swearing (I know it was a lot, and many variants of ""fuck"").  I was on the ground for about 2 minutes, just trying to collect myself.

My reward?  Big ass welt.

Observe:

"I came here to say this, but you already have. Anyways, whenever I hit my head, bam, if anyone is nearby I'll swear at them and freak. Or just swear at anything in general. I get so pissed, but it goes away within about 30 seconds, then I'm just like ""owchie"".

I never get mad when I get hurt anywhere else, even if it hurts more (read: pinkie toe corner). So I find it interesting that it's just head bangs that get me pissed... Smart people of Reddit, any idea?"
"I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE!

I attempt to destroy the object I hit my head on, even if it's a door frame or the bus roof."
"I'm the same way.   I get so angry when I crack my head on something.   Mostly at myself though for doing it AGAIN!  The most painful though is when you hit the top of your head at an angle that jams your head down into your neck!    Ugh...  Being 6'7"" this is a near daily occurance for me  :("
I entered this thread thinking about being hit in the head. It made me angry before I even got to this post!
my SO is the same, it's pretty strange since he's a super mellow and gentle guy. then he bumps his head and punches whatever poor object that got in his way. Super uncharacteristic and a bit funny, but completely unexplainable.
"haha - I never noticed until you mentioned.  Just yesterday I tagged my head on an open locker at the gym.  I closed that locker, raged quietly for 5.2 seconds, and then punched it.



Why did I do that?"
I wish I could be more helpful, but this does actually activate a fight-or-flight response different from other contact and I believe testosterone is released. I dunno. Evolution...somethin'.
Im like this with my knees. People can poke me, fuck with me any other way, but if the start fucking pinching my kneecaps? I will fucking draw blood and drink it from my goblet of victory.
"I smacked my face on an open door when trying to get hair out of my face.
Rather than anger, I kinda just stood there for some time, dumbfounded. "
My reflex when I get hit in the head is to go limp and collapse. My friends use to like throwing footballs at me when I wasn't paying attention. 
Rubbing your head is the quickest way for you to check for any clear injuries. For example, if you start bleeding after hitting your head, and touch the blood, you'll realize that you have been injured and might should seek help. It's pretty easy to see how such behavior would be an evolutionary advantage.
"What's worse is when someone asks you: ""Are you okay?""
FUCK YOU, JUST DON'T FUCKING TALK TO ME. FUCK."
"Here is how I keep from looking or feeling like an angry, immature person.

If it hurts, I hit the ground. It keeps me from danger if what I hit my head on is dangerous, it keeps me from hitting it again, and if anyone looks, they know what happened, rather than just seeing me throwing an angry asshole tantrum."
I'm assuming it is a natural way of protecting future incidents of bonking your head. If you get so upset, you are less likely to do it again.
"I was in a drunken ""Lets see who can smash their head hardest on the dining room table"" contest this weekend.  I'm not sure who won..."
"My thought on the idea is if it burst more you'll be less likely to do it again.

It conditions you to watch out for the most vital part of your body."
"Was going to say exactly this myself.  Total, seething, cave-man rage, which I often take out on whatever I hit my head against.  As in punching that asshole low shelf that just deigned to make contact with my head.

Then I feel like a complete idiot because I've punched a shelf."
My guess: your head contains your brain. That which controls your body. Your behaviour is a remnant of survival instinct kicking in to protect the head. Back then it was a club/sword to fend off. Now it's a kitchen closet or table.
">I feel like I turn into a caveman if I hit my head on something

Never thought of it that way but now I will always think of it this way"
I always felt weird getting so irrationally angry when that happened, good to know it happens to other people.
"I am so glad that I'm not the only one. 

The over-reactive, irrational fury really made me feel that this was not a thing.  "
"I'm the same way if somebody touches my nose. I feel like it might be an OCD issue. I don't really know how to explain it, but I freak out and I have to start wiggling my nose until it feels ""right again"".. like everything is ""out of place"" and it needs to be dealt with immediately. I just lose it."
Especially the back of my head!  It could be a pretty light tap from someone but all I see is red when this happens!  Need experts to explain.
Something similar, I wear a hardhat for at least eight hours a day. If ANYTHING starts to bump it, tug it, or otherwise pull it off, I want to kick somethings ass.
When I hit my head or my knee, I just start asking the universe to kill me right then and there. If you're going to make something so inconsequential hurt so much, you might as well make it fatal.
I agree... It's so crazy that I'm reading it on here too, but if I get hit on my head, specially the back of my head, I don't give a fuck who you are, what your age or what your gender is, I will knock you the fuck out
Yes, this is the best articulation of something I've always experienced but never seen put into words. There were times when I'd bang my head on an open overhead cabinet in the kitchen and get so mad that I punch it closed. The rage is very primal.
I feel your pain. Some injuries makes me want to hurt whatever hurt me. Be it a door or a wall. It's getting slapped. 
WHO DESIGNED THIS?!?!! GOD WHO WOULD PUT IT RIGHT THERE. and its like a perfectly normal place like your drawer under your desk. 
As a bald man, yah. Two recent incidents currently in the healing process. My wife tells me it's because I have no early warning system.
This exactly. Example, during a friendly dorm pillow fight at school, guy hits me on the head, not hard enough to hurt but it was jarring. I then became the hulk and attempted to rip his limbs off. Took 3 people to get me off him. Then I came too and realised what had happened. In general I'm not even a violent person so I'm convinced there's something that causes this reaction. 
I read an article a while ago that suggests it's a natural response due to brain injuries generally putting a damper on things such as your continued life. I'll see if I can find the link.
Fight or flight. I'm just under 6'4 and I hit my head on shit every time. And every time I do, I get infuriated and want to punch stuff. Similar to what happens when you walk into a spider web. Instant Kung Fu.
"> Apparently this is pretty common! Does anybody know why this happens?

I believe it has something to do with ""spatial awareness"" and simply means you forgot to pay attention, which is the more infuriating part of hitting your head.

As for me, it is a simple reminder that I (we) am (are) not invincible.

usually when it happens to me it's because I got high on endorphines or something and feel like I can tackle the world and bring down everything that stands in my way, but then *buff* ""when did I open this window?""

that's when I get back to reality and remember that success must never ever get to my head, next time it happens could be someone's knife slashing through my skull."
"Whoa ... I've seen people like this before.     

They get a little bump on the head and suddenly become a rage filled asshole for a few minutes.       "
Oh wow, I thought I was alone in this! Yeah, I've never felt rage like when I hit my head on something.
yesterday i was mowing the lawn and hit my head on the hummingbird feeder... HOLY FUCK RAGE MODE ACTIVATED, ALL THAT STICKY FUCKING HUMMINGBIRD JUICE SHIT AND GRASS DONT MIX!
"I'm 6'3"" and I hit my head on everything. The cabinets, the shed ceiling, shower frame, shower head, doorways, trees the list goes on. So I turn into a caveman all the time. "
"So, you feel like a caveman when you hit you're head so your automatic response is to act like a caveman?

That's some sound logic."
For me, that's when something stupid and minor actually hurts a lot.  Like stubbing your toe or catching your finger in a slowly closing door.  Instantly see red for part of a second, then realize it wasn't that bad.
Also when your head is within an inch of the object it suddenly accelerates to insurmountable speeds and then BAM! wtf just happened and why am I bleeding.
"I was buckling my one year old in his car seat when he lunged forward and headbutted me in the nose. I reflexively flailed backward and hit the back of my head on the top edge of the open car door behind me. So then I reflexively flailed forward and smacked my forehead on the top of the car, then spun away dizzy and seeing stars and fell down and bruised and skinned my knees and hands on the ground.

So yeah, the worst beating I ever got was from a 20 pound toddler and an inanimate object. :/
"
I don't get as mad when an injury to my head is self afflicted, but when someone slaps me or somehow hurts my face, it makes me angrier than anything. 
Yeah same with either stubbing my toe and either funny bone. Mentioned this to my friend the other day and he had no idea what I was talking about. 
"As a 6'7"" guy, who has one this MANY times, I feel your pain o.O

I'm sure I have a mild phobia of cupboard doors thanks to some ""incidents"".  Argh, those corners!"
"I am a fairly laid back guy, pretty slow to anger, many a time people have told me, ""Why didn't you do something about that douche?"" or something along those lines. I always just shrug it off and don't think much of it. (btw I'm 6'5"" and 300 lbs) but when I hit my head.... I can not do justice in describing my rage. I... feel this deep, red, heat. I genuinely see red and will punch, very hard, at whatever I hit my head on. Many a hole in a cupboard door.

My girlfriend, whom I love dearly, claims it is the only time she is legitimately scared for her safety. (I have never even attempted to hit her or anyone else). But she can see the change happen in me to that primal beast. And then back almost instantly. I wish I knew why that happened....
"
I think the worst is when you misjudge the distance between your head and the car door frame.  Ugh!  Hello, goose egg.
You and I appear to share a boat. I nearly ripped door off it's hinges because I cracked my head on the corner of a shelf. I don't know why it just makes me so incredibly angry :/
"I feel like that when I burn myself, whether it's fire, hot water, the stove, etc. 

Mainly I feel dumb for forgetting what I'm around is hot. Then the pain sets in too slow, and lingers too long. I've already got my hand out of the sink before it starts to hurt, and then continues through several obscenities. "
With my job, I'm always in other people's homes. This reflects my number one on this list. I gift you the thought of gold. (Does that count?) 
"I hate the noise *other* people make when *you* hit your head. That high pitched ""oooohhhh!!!"" with the sour face. It's horrible hitting your head knowing someone else is in the room because there's this brutally slow fraction of a second where you're processing the pain, and then you realize someone's there, and you *know* they're going to make that fucking noise. For some reason it makes it a thousand times worse, but nobody can control themselves.

There's no greater feeling of relief than hitting your head and realizing nobody saw, and nobody will react with any stupid fucking noises and faces."
"This*100 = my rage when a hornet stung my eyelid a few weeks back. 

First I shouted in surprise. Then I paused a moment before giving a scream of primal anger. I would have instantly slain every hornet in existence with my mind if the possibility existed at the time. "
"My exgf ""playfully"" hit the back of my head and I flipped out.  No clue why but getting slapped behind my head makes me rage. "
So if the principal gets jumped by students he should be charged with assaulting a minor according to this logic.
For me it is the concept of zero tolerance in general. People should receive fair punishments and rehabilitation when necessary.
"What I think someone should do in this situation is blackmail the school. Say if they are punished for being the victim, they will give the story to the press, creating public outrage. 
""School punishes innocent student for being attacked"" is what the papers will say. With a nice big photo of the poor child's messed up face."
"It's not even just zero tolerance in fighting. Here in Massachusetts there was a girl that just got in trouble for picking her drunk friend up at a party. She had no alcohol and the police cleared her to drive home. She was doing the responsible thing and keeping her friend from potentially killing herself and others. However because the school has a ""zero tolerance policy regarding drugs an alcohol"" she was suspended. Fucking disgusting"
There is really no perfect system for how to handle school fights.  If you only punish the person who started the fight, you risk students lying about it and punishing the wrong person while letting other person walk free.  If you punish both people you get rage inducing stories like this one.  If you punish neither the parents all complain to you that you're encouraging fighting and are opening yourself up to lawsuits.
I wonder what goed on in the minds of people that think this is a good idea, how the fuck can you even come up with this shit? Is this common in the States? I've read stories like this multiple times on Reddit now and I can't imagine this being the case everywhere. Here, there are no such rules, not even close, if a bully beats you, you have the right to hit him untill [s]he stops hitting you. Self defence and all. And the school wouldn't suspend you or anything like that. They'll slap the bully on the wrist, maybe somekind of detention, and let the victim go about their day, maybe force the two to talk or some shit, but hell, nothing like this zero tolerance bullshit.
This rule is stupid, but the point of it is to try and have zero fights, but when they do happen everyone gets fucked
I saw these 5 thugs listening to a boombox the other day. I assumed it was rap or something, but as I got closer I realized it was actually Lindsey Stirling. Couldn't help but giggle.
"Reminds me of a time when this dick at my college gym did this.  Here's the kicker though, he had a portable speaker to make it LOUDER.  This complete with a loud ""woo!"" between sets.  He wasn't even that big.  What. A. Douche.

Edit: repeated word, thanks dancegrenade."
They are so fucking annoying I saw onw kid walking around with dr dre beats headphones around his neck and blasting ghetto rap out of his iPhone (headphones not connected at all)
I was behind a guy in line at a convenience store. He had his phone blaring music throughout his whole browsing/standing-in-line/paying-for-his-shit/leaving expedition.
As well as those people who walk around with the person who they're talking to on speaker phone.  That drives me insane.  I don't want to hear your fucking conversation.
I feel your pain: someone I invited to dinner at my house took out his iPhone and opened up Pandora and placed it on the table for us all to enjoy... Not impressed.
I was on the metro in D.C and there was this guy watching the Jimmy Kimmel show at full volume on his phone laughing his ass off 
why? it's a good way to pass the time on a metro/bus ride. definitely dangerous if you do it while walking around the city though
or when people have head phones but have the volume sooooo loud that all you can hear is garbled shit. there's a kid in my class who does this every single class, even leaving it on until the professor has to tell him to turn it off. Whty are you in college?
"Added rage: people who do this *when they have a pair of fucking expensive pair of headphones with them that they wear ""just for show"".* You may not think it happens often, but oh boy, I've seen it plenty of times to make me want to skydive with an anvil on my back."
"Eh, I don't mind so much. As long as I'm just passing through, it's almost pleasant to drift past a song, even if I don't particularly like it. The exception is when it's being played through tinny speakers... ugh.

To be honest, though, unless my phone's out of charge, 90% of the time I'm wearing my headphones anyway..."
Worse than that for me is people listening to music on their phone while HIKING out in pristine, quiet wilderness areas. What kind of devilish fucking moron does this? ? I go out there to enjoy nature, not hear your shitty music. 
Where I live there are tons of migrant workers. Usually they'll walk into a grocery store or corner store with their phones or radios playing music really loud, and it's usually very stereotypical (ie. Jamaicans have reggae, Mexicans have mariachi, etc). It's actually quite funny, to be honest.
"It's a shame I have to do this sometimes. My job requires I walk all day but I'm not allowed to have headphones in... ""Safety""


8 hours without coworkers or anyone to talk to 5 times a week? That blows. 

I do turn it off when I'm nearing a strip mall or something similar. "
It annoys me maybe even more when they're wearing headphones turned so loud you can still hear the lyrics. How can that even be enjoyable??
"Especially when it's inappropriate and kids are around. Last time I was on a train I saw a 15y/o girl listening to bounce on my dick-tyga with a 8 y/o sitting 3 seats behind her. Mind you she used speakers

I actually have a couple tracks on my phone that I put there just to blast in response to people like this. They blast rap, I'll blast bhangra, traditional Chinese music, MC Hammer, or Bluegrass. I'm white, by the way. What, are THEY going to tell ME to turn MY music down?
Yeah, classic...this happens everytime I'm on a bus or train...annoying! Like do you really think people want to hear your music blasting? This isn't a freakin' club!
This is the one who really gets to me. Here in Brazil we have this branch of Funk music where you have the same type of background tune for every music and almost all of them invoves bullshit like rape, cheating in relationships, meaningful sex in all possible positions, guns, violence, everything bad. And it's the only music they hear on speakers at public transportation. It's like they want everybody to be angry and frustrated, just to show that they are rebels and don't care. And still no law to forbid it. And don't get me started on cars with sound systems to play this music on maximum volume at our streets at 3am.
Where I live its against the rules for us to walk around with headphones unless we're on a running track and running. So everyone has to walk around like this if they want some music. We don't blast it, just loud enough to hear it for ourselves. 
Really? Oh I'm sorry a bit of noise is bugging you.  Maybe I shouldn't talk either. I better walk slower so my cloths dont rustle and cause a public disturbance. 
Theres this kid on my bus that listens to screamer music every day at 6:30 am its so fucking annoying
A law was passed where I live so everybody who listens to music on public transportation has to wear headphones :)
"Aggggh. There's this kid at my school. 

It would seem we both have free time between classes at the same time. It's a really small campus, so study area is limited. 

This kid listens to his electronic music **SO LOUD** through his headphones, the entire room can hear it. 

So, listening to music loud enough that it leaks badly out of your headphones. Yep. That's instant rage. "
"Seriously, I really hate this shit. Any time someone does it around me, I tell them to turn it off. ""why man, it's just music."" Yeah it's just music, but when it's coming out of your tiny shitty phone speakers, then it's noise. That speaker was made for when your phone rings not when you feel like sharing lil wayne's new album with the world."
Now I feel bad. I walk down the street with my friend, and we always turn on some sort of traveling music
I know the feeling. They can't afford headphones? I don't wanna listen to that bullshit you call music.
Similar rage: I hate people playing online games with mic's on, and play music over that as if we the audience are supposed to compliment him for his choice in music, or people who turn in their mic's but only use to to swear, sniffle, cough, breathe heavily and rage into, why did you waste money on a mic you clearly don't use?
There is a kid at my high school that just walks around with a little ipod speaker blasting hip hop. There isn't any point, dude, buy some headphones! 
Nonononononono, I know something worse. When these people park their asses in the quiet section of the train and everyone can hear their music. Why are you in the quiet section in the first place then?! You can't hear anything and you're just bothering everyone with your music!
Tinny music is fucking irritating whatever the source! For me, it's the people with the shitty, free-with-your-airline-seat quality, out-of-the-box white iPhone headsets that piss me off. $500 phone, 20c earbuds. They jack up the volume because the buds don't fit *anyone* properly and they can't hear anything - as a result their ears act like mini-amphitheatres and broadcast their disturbing taste in music to the entire train carriage.
"If you're in a city it can make sense for many reasons:

A. Forgot/lost headphones.
B. Being able to be aware of your surroundings.
C. Listening to your shit loud without hurting your ears like headphones do.
D. Expressing yourself, because we all know how much people love saying you can express yourself in this country and then hating you when you do.

That being said, I never ever do this. But as long as the person is listening to it on complete blast or has a completely shitty blown smartphone speaker, I don't see the harm. I usually will have headphones or I just deal with it.

If I were going to be around the person for a prolonged time then I'd mention something if it annoyed me. Otherwise, get the fuck over yourself."
"I ride light rail to/from work every day, and I have *never* to this date seen someone doing this who isn't black. I see it almost every day and *every single time* it's a younger black person with their shitty cell phone blaring some music that's absolutely impossible to hear over the bottoming-out speaker...

I must not be the only one who's noticed this trend, does anyone have any possible explanation?"
At A&M there's a guy that always plays Christian rock out of speakers in his backpack. He was featured in the campus newspaper with plenty of praise. It pisses me off.
yeah thats such bullshit. That said though, my dad always told me he'd be fine picking me up if I was defending myself. I'm going to tell my kids the same thing 
"That happened to me when I was in school.  A kid started a fight and we both got suspended.

My parents were pissed and told the school they were being dumb.

Later that week during dinner my dad told me the following story: ""When he and my uncle were kids my uncle threw a book at the wall and started crying.  When grandma came in he told her that my dad hit him.  Dad got spanked.

The next time my uncle threw a book, my dad hit him.  He said if he was going to get punished for it he should at least get to hit my uncle.""

Back from suspension the kid starts messing with me again, so I tackled him, grabbed his shirt and started punching him in the nose (another thing dad taught me. Make the eyes water they can't see to fight back.)

Got suspended again, my parents told the school to fuck off and bought me a toy. "
"You were supposed to let them hit you. Don't you know how it works? Let them beat you up, then cry and be humiliated as you go to the principle's office while everyone calls you a ""taddle tale"". One the principle knows, he shall punish those mean kids that hit you with...a stern talking to. And since they said they'd never do it again, the principle is happy and you're sitting there with a broken face. 

Reminds me of the American justice system "
Eh, if I have a kid and this happens, free stay-home vacation for them. I won't punish the kid for defendong themselves.
Most schools have an ass backwards idea that people will jump in and break up the fight 2 punches in. No, we are standing in a circle to watch two people duke it out to the end. 
"Hell, even if you don't defend yourself you can get in trouble.  I came up to one of my friends, who was pissed about something, asked what was wrong, got shoved into a locker, he kept walking.  Fine, you don't want to talk about it.  Another kid started ripping on him about being pissy, and my friend started kicking him.  Other kid kept being an asshole and provoking him, but he didn't fight back.

Now here's the bullshit: Teacher breaks up the fight, they get sent to the principal, they talk, get the story, my name gets dropped, as does another kid's name, who was in a similar situation as me (got pushed out of the way for asking what was wrong).  Both of us end up in the conversation, confirm the two fighters' story about us asking what was wrong and getting shoved out of the way and leaving it alone after that.  Everyone agrees, he and I did nothing wrong, we were victims.  We go back to class, those two stay to talk more with the principal.  15 minutes later, I get called back to the office, along with the other kid that got shoved.  The two fighters have to talk to their parents about it, that's the extent of their punishment.  Me, and the other kid, though, we have to spend the next two weeks raising the flag every morning and spreading mulch after we finished eating lunch.  Fighters get off free, effectively, and I have to spread mulch.  For being shoved.

Fucking bullshit."
"I wish that was the dumbest rule. The no-tolerance policies in general are ridiculous. Kids who make a gun using their finger and thumb getting week-long suspensions, for example is insane. 

But then, schools step WAY out of bounds, imo, by punishing kids for doing things off of school property. I read about two boys who got into a fight away from school grounds during non-school hours. Both were suspended for fighting. Same thing with posting things online when not at school during non-school hours. That's the parents job, not the schools."
I've heard that it's so the kid who fought back doesn't go to school the next day and get jumped by the other kids buddies. Still think the zero tolerance policy towards violence is bullshit, though. Sometimes two individuals need a violent catharsis to end their disagreement.
"On my 4th day of middle school, some kid decided to grab me by the neck and slam me into a brick wall. Another kid was behind me when he was doing this, so my head knocked into the other kid's head, and the other kid was out cold for like 10 seconds.

I was punished with 2 days in school suspension, which meant I had to sit in a tiny room with a huge pile of work and a teacher watching me the whole time.

The kid who threw me got one day out of school suspension. A day off. Justice was served?"
Don't you fight back! If you want to be that kind of person then we'll stop giving out sports participation trophies! 
FUCK that shit. Back when I was in school it always seemed the teachers, counselors, etc. took the bullies side instead of the victim's. Did that happen to anyone else? Why are teachers and other staff so daft that they can't see who's in the wrong? Fuck them for making my life hell back then.
As someone who regularly had to defend himself in high school, I concur.  What's worse is when you're the one beaten up and you're the only one who gets detention/suspension because you DIDN'T fight back.
I remember hearing a lecture in my high school regarding this. The teacher basically told us if we are in a fight, we have the right to defend; however, we will get in trouble and suspended for defending ourselves. If you don't defend, you'll get beat up and still be suspended for encouraging a fight. Catholic school. 
"These were the rules when I was in school 15-20 years ago as well. Both parties would get suspended regardless of who started it.

Honestly, even if you didn't fight back, you'd probably still get suspended just for being involved."
I'm still waiting for some kid that gets blasted in the nose to sue the school for knowingly stripping him of his right to self defense AND failing to defend him.
If that ever happens with my kid, he'll serve his suspension, plus a few extra days, at Disneyworld. 
"Good job! You took all his punches and kicks to the head and was in a coma but at least you didn't fight! -_-

I also wonder how it would turn out if a student fought with a teacher and the teacher just took all the punches and people congratulated him for not fighting hmmmmmm"
"My school has a ""3 hit rule"", meaning if you hit someone back before them hitting you thrice, you're expelled with them. You could be knocked the fuck out before 3 hits."
Uhh, news flash, buddy. You don't have to defend yourself to get suspended. If a random person punches a random person, they will both be suspended.
"When I was in school I was picked on a lot.  In 6th grade I got into a fight. By ""got into"" I mean that I was insulted, I told the guy he was an asshole, and got attacked. I arguably ""threw a punch"" when I was knocked to the ground (more like my arm flailed and didn't even hit him or anybody).  Three minutes later I was unconscious with a concussion, two black eyes, a broken bloody nose, needing dental work, and bruising over most of my body.  Two of his buddies had held me down while he was punching me with both hands.  Finally a teacher pulled him off of me.  I woke up in the hospital to find out that we were both suspended for a week despite the fact that I did not fight back and required surgery while the only injury he suffered was bruising on his knuckles.  I was not allowed to make up work and my grades suffered as a result.  His buddies got 1 hour of detention each."
"Father always said dont start it, but end it. Always promised me if I followed that he would have my back, first time this happened at school.

My dad calmly walks into the Principals office, Locks the door behind him (me sitting crestfallen at the thought of suspension for defending myself) All my dad said was this.

""Sir, I am going to start punching you, please don't defend yourself as it against your policy.""

Principal looks to me, than the door, and back at my dad.

""I see your point, Ill let him have a warning this once."" 

My Dad.

""Ditto."" 

Left no suspension."
My dad always told me that I wasn't in trouble unless it was with him, and if I got suspended for defending myself if anything he'd be having words with the principal. My dad's a cool guy.
The logic I've been told is more of a liability thing. It's for ensuring the aggressor gets suspended, regardless of how the story went, and for making sure that if one of them suffered a concussion but didn't know it, they wouldn't have any lingering effects happen on campus. 
"""We know that legally you have the right to defend yourself if somebody attacks you, but here at school we'd rather you be a meek little punching bag!"""
"Well unless it's recorded on camera(which where I went to school it was if anything happened in a hallway) there is no way to know which kid started it seeing as they both are on thin ice and risking being grounded. Suspension isn't bad either most kids are thrilled to have a a day off although make up work can be problematic. Unless charges are being pressed it's a waste if time for the administrators to launch an ""investigation"" when both kids are usually equally to blame. 

TLDR; your kid is lying so he can go be a hooligan with his friends instead of being grounded"
It might be a U.K thing but when people my friend had a fight at school when some guy swung at him and my friend swung back (in self defense) my friend got off free because he didn't start it.
I've instructed my kids to defend themselves and I will defend them for it. If a bully causes my kid to become violent it is then the schools fault for creating a violent atmosphere. 
"When I was in middle school some ass hole threw paint all over me. I was REALLY poor as a kid, and maybe 65 lbs at the time. I was always in the first percentile, and even at 24 I am only 99 lbs.

Anyway, this kid starts picking on me and calling me names. Him and his friends threw a bunch of paint all over me, and then proceeded to make fun of me because they knew I couldn't afford to replace them.

In retaliation I said, ""Tayler, go grow a dick.""

I got detention for sexual harassment. He didn't get in any trouble at all.
"
This isn't recent, I was in 6th in 2002 and got jumped by 3 dudes during recess, I didn't even hit anyone and got ISS for 3 days. Was pretty bullshit. The dude who suckerpunched me got OSS for a week and would ride his bike up to the school when it let out to talk to his friends. Quality school.
"This was the way it was when I was in highschool; I'm 27 now. 
I was bullied a LOT.. at least they tried like hell to bully me. They followed me around and taunted me almost constantly, but I was pretty good at just ignoring it, so it didn't bother me much. More than a couple times I was suspended for throwing a couple punches or pulling somebody's hair to defend myself when they decided to get physical with me. I missed so much time due to suspensions that I had to repeat the year.

Fuck highschoolers."
My school's official rule is that you are allowed to cross you arms in an x shape per your face and neck. Anything else and you're suspended. It makes so much sense because my arms in an x shape will really protect me from someone who is full on trying to hurt me and can also hit other parts of my body.
"WHen I was a kid, I was in one of my Karate lessons. My little brother started punching and kicking me, so I pushed him away, and he fell. The sensei (basically the instructor) came over to me and started yelling at me. That's right. I got in trouble for defending myself...  
  
*at a self defense class.*"
Kid attacked me in school I was backed up to a wall punched him twice fight was over 250 dollar fine + court fees
In my school, even if you dont fight back you get in trouble anyways, so If im ever in a fight I go all out.
What's the best way to ensure people don't defend themselves when the fascist police force comes to strip you of your individual freedoms? Maybe teach them in school from a very young age that defending yourself deserves the same punishment as a brutal assault.
"In my school if you got punched, you'd be suspended whether you hit back or not!

I just thought it was such a bad idea, partially because it could be used as a method of bullying. "
"Yep yep yep, in high school I defended one of my friends from a bully by shoving him on the ground. Got up, swung a punch, grabbed it and shoved him into a locker. Only to then be thrown across the room by a huge senior. My punishment? 3 day suspension since I wasn't in danger. The other kid got 1 day with anger management classes. 

My parents were furious, and is the reason we are not boosters anymore."
"I'm....kind of in favor of this.  Yeah, you might be needlessly hurt as a result, but I'm one of those ""principle outweighs the practical"" kinds of guys.  Violence begets violence and whatnot."
"What's even worse is the kid that starts the fights is usually a ""special exception"" for some reason and never gets in trouble for anything.  They've actually stopped punishing the problem students, and instead choose to reward them when they don't try to kill someone for a week."
"Bothers me especially, having a son. Don't want him being told that it is against the rules for him to have a spine 


"
My school was worse, you would get in trouble for being in a fight, even if you didn't fight back. So you could get in trouble for being punched.
If they still have this rule when I have a kid I am going to take mine out for ice cream and go to the movies. 
I was suspended for this in 7th grade. Back in 1977. I don't get why people think this is a new rule. Or was my school that different?
There is a reason though. Firstly, its not hard to go through school and not get into fights. Secondly, figuring out who started the fight is difficult. Its easy to say when its your kid, but that's obviously a pretty biased position. If a kid is getting punched, the probably antagonized the other kid (or were fighting back right before the teacher came upon the scene). If this rule were not the case it would allow the abuse of the rules and encourage antagonizing the other kids to get them in trouble. Anyway, all I'm saying is that the issue is complex and easy to oversimplify. Also its very hard to take a logical and impartial view of the issue because we have ALL been on both sides in some respect and all have strong feelings because we were once children too.
"I understand suspending both students if they both threw punches. It encourages kids learn how to talk a situation down. 

that said, if my kid was picking fights he'd get additional punishment. but if he was defending himself (or others, as /u/masterf99 mentioned) then it would just be whatever. "
Happened to me in the 8th grade. I was being bullied by this kid and I eventually snapped and just tore his ass up. Everyone even vouched for me, saying I was just defending myself. I got suspended for a week and couldn't go on the big end of the year field trip to Busch Gardens and lost touch of my friends after we started high school because of it. 
A girl in my school got jumped by two sisters, she defended herself by curling up into a ball until it was stopped. She got suspended for 10 days for being involved in a fight but after the video was shown to the principal, it was cut to 3 days. The fact that she got any punishment for being attacked pissed me off to no end.
in the 9th grade I had a bully named Tyron.  He would always pick on me to the point that I hated going to school.  One day he gave me a titty twister so hard that I started bleeding.  Something snapped (aside from my nip) and I saw red. I felt unstoppable.  As soon as he let go, I hopped to my feet and started swinging.  Knocked him down, then I climbed on top for three or four good licks, while straddling him, bleeding from my fucking nipples.  Had that fucker in tears.  Once the dust settled, the teacher (only adult witness) stood up for me that the other kid was a bully and personally commended me for sticking up for myself.  The principal suspended us both for 2 weeks each.  Fuck you, Tyron.
"Don't know whether this is just in my school, but another thing that annoys me is some poor kid will be getting seven bell kicked out of him, and all but one or two teachers just nonchalantly wander over ""To the rescue."" There's never any urgency, it's like they don't give a fuck. And then the kid'll get excluded for  fighting, somehow."
"A timely story in the NY Post:

""The Bullies Will Keep Winning if Kids Don't Fight Back""

http://nypost.com/2013/10/20/the-bullies-will-keep-winning-if-kids-dont-fight-back/?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost"
This applies to almost every thing in life not just schools or metaphorically. If you are out on the street a lot of times you will get penalized in court if you fight back.
"While it frustrates the hell out of me, it does teach an important lesson: Sometimes you lose, no matter your options.  Sometimes you have to do something that is by all means wrong, in this instance, beating the hell out of someone, but justified, because they started it, and when it's over, you take your punishment, because it was worth it.

My brother had a very similar thing happened, and my parents talked to him about exactly this, then gave him a few extra chores to do, but paid him for his time, to get him thinking about whether he'd rather be in school or grunt labor."
"I'm in high school now but I still remember that day back in grade school where they basically said ""On school grounds, you lose your right to self defense."" Dude, fuck that. If someone hits me, I will not put up with it. I'll hit em right back"
My highest rated comment is specifically about this.  My brother got anger management classes, community service, fines and suspension for swinging back when he got jumped.  Such a load of horseshit.
"Similar story here. I was in 7th grade, and had a pretty intense mutual hatred with this jackass. We'll call him ""Matt"" for this story, because that was his name. Anyway, we were out on the playground for lunch, and I saw him beating up my best friend from across the playground. I hauled ass over there, tackled him, and beat the living hell out of the kid. All three of us (Me, Matt, and my friend) were taken to the Principal's Office and our parents were called. My friend was a witness and vouched that I was standing up for her. Her parents (who liked me and were like a second family to me) said the same, that I wouldn't have done anything like that without a reason. My parents didn't say much, they just wanted to understand what happened. The kicker, though, was Matt's mom. She told the Principal, ""Hey, the kid probably had it coming."" I got off with a stern talking to from the principal, and I had to go out for ice cream after as my punishment."
"This exists in real life too - google ""escalation of conflict laws"" and prepare to rage the hell out."
My brother and this one guy got in a fight. The guy got expelled,  but even though by brother didn't fight back he got suspended.  It was bullshit
"Alright, story time motherfuckers

I was about 13 or 14 at the time and some scumbag was following me around all day asking me to fight him after school. I had spent all day telling him to fuck off because I didn't want to fight him, he then tells me he's going to get his brother. Then all of a sudden out of fucking nowhere his 17 year old brother shows up and headbutts me and starts punching me, I get him a headlock and bring him to the ground  continues punching me while I hold him down. He is shouting at me to let him up and I tell him to stop hitting me first he stops I let him up and he gets up and fucks off, I then turn to the little fucker who got his brother to fight me, grab him and throw him on the ground. My friend tells me we should go tell the principal what just happened because I was fucking attacked. Me and my friend tell the principal what happened, I get sent home early and all three of us are suspended for a week despite the fact I did my best to prevent the fighting and he started on me. My mother got really angry with him, ""what the fuck was he supposed to do? Stand there and get punched?"" Fuck that principal though, how he even got his job I don't know because he is stupid, used to be a woodwork teacher and once put on a porn film for his students to watch when he left the room by accident, among other things. 

**TL;DR: self defence, asshole principal, week off school.**"
Yeah. We had a rule when I went to high school that said you couldn't go within literally 1 foot (about 30 or so cm) of each other. Everyone just dumped that rule including teachers. They only would bring it back up if kids started really getting into their *love moments*
Luckily that is not the case in my school. If you are assaulted and are merely defending yourself, then the officer on duty will hear your side of the story and talk to witnesses and most likely let you go.
What logic? When I was in middle school there was a guy who didn't like me. At this school after you got done eating lunch you went into the gym and sat on the bleachers because there were too many students to fit everyone in the cafeteria. I was sitting on those bleachers with my buddies Josh and John on either side of me, we are the first ones out and the only ones in there so far. The only other human being is the school employee (not sure exactly what his official job was) who got stuck in there. So the guy who doesn't like me walks into the gym, walks up the bleachers to us and starts punching me. He hits me 3 times before Josh and John grab him and pull him off me. The school guy sees this whole thing. I got a month's detention, although if that happened today I'd probably be suspended. I also remember being put in a little room in the school's office for a few hours and a woman asking me repeatedly for a half hour at a time if I had hit him back and if I was sure I hadn't hit him back.
It's fucking bullshit. Even if you try walking away, you're still screwed. Been in that situation in my school. Girl went psycho on me, threw two punches, i walked away knowing if i hit her back (even in self defense) i'd still get in trouble... Yea,, STILL got in trouble even though I WALKED AWAY. Bullshit. 
You don't understand. It's to force students to actually fight back and beat the shit out of their bullies. It doesn't matter anymore, you're getting punished anyway.
"It isn't just now. According to my mom, that's how I got into trouble multiple times as a kid. Even with the lunch monitors vouched for me being non-aggressive and trying to avoid things, I was suspended for fighting.

In 1981."
Happened to me. I got punched in the face, causing my nose to bleed. I wipe the blood on the shirt of the guy who punched me. Assistant principal gives me 2 days of in school suspension. Principle comes in to suspension room on day 1, asks why I am there, I tell him, and he laughs his ass off and says I can go.
Said this before. At my school, if someone attacks you and you don't even throw a punch, you're punished as well for being in the fight.
I'm sure that if I somehow ended up in a fight that I did not initiate, then my parents would be OK with me defending myself. The school? Not so much. But my parents would be perfectly fine.
When I was in high school a kid as attacked for no reason.  He assumed the fetal position and got the crap beat out of him including getting kicked in the face.  He got the same suspension as the group that attacked him.
"back when I was in high school and they were first starting to enact something like this you didn't even have to throw a punch...if you were ""involved in a physical altercation you got suspended"". 

I remember because I had already been suspended several times that year and a kid punched me on the bus right before we got to school. I grabbed him and pinned his arms to his side and just sat there till we got to school.

When we were taken to the principals office [together] and explained what happened I was told I was being suspended just for being in a fight. I tried to explain that I didn't fight back and was told ""it does not matter, you were involved in a fight"".

I laughed...stood up in the principals office and hit that kid right in the eye knocking him out of his chair. Said something along the lines of ""might as well make it worth it"" and walked home. Luckily when they called my parents they got a response along the lines of ""what did you expect?"""
Not in my school. If it's defense and you have evidence it was only in self-defense, no punishment. Unless it's against a female in which case you're screwed.
I learned in school like 15 years ago that if you fight back, you're both in trouble. If you don't fight back then it's assault and the other person will definitely get in more shit. Luckily I never got in fights so I never had to decide what to do. 
"Ya know... I'm going to tell my kid ""Timmy,"" my kid's going to be named Timmy.  

I'll say ""Timmy.  If you're bullied in school, I want you to go to the principal and tell them about it.  If you're ever in a fight in school, you're going to be suspended.  That's just how it is.  So I want you to do your best to **murder** the person you're attacking.  You bite, you scratch, you try and jam your thumbs in their eyes, you box their ears and don't even stop when someone tries to pull you off, you dig in.  When they ask you what happened you tell them that you were defending yourself, and you knew you would be suspended no matter what you did and that if that wasn't school policy, you would have only tried to fend them off until a teacher came.  And when they call me, Timmy, I won't be angry with you, I'll be proud.  And if the other kid's parent comes in yelling about how you bit their kid's ear off and collapsed their larynx, I'll ask them if they'd rather you stood there and let their little failure beat the shit out of you.  Timmy, it's never **ever** okay to throw the first punch, but you **have** to be the one who throws the last punch."""
"That means they have more time to have meetings that could be using investigating incidents. 

You can't expect them to waste valuable meeting time on trivial matters like running a school. Plus all that pesky liability. "
 We're raising a generation of pussies. What the hell are you supposed to do if someone jumps you in the halls?
I'm guessing this has to do because it's hard to tell who is lying. Not getting in trouble for defending yourself, but the school thinks it's easier to suspend both of them as opposed to just spending the wrong one. Kids/teens/adults lie. Bullying does happen, but sometimes parents have to open their eyes and realize that it might be their child who is the bully. Also, sometimes It's not even bullying, It's just stupidity. I've seen two girls fight over a boy, two guys fight over an ounce of weed. 
"In 6th grade, a kid stabbed himself vertically with a pencil and his special ed teacher was the one watching over us, so I was blamed for it.

I got a detention during lunch.

>mfw my detention ended up being in his classroom, and I made intimidating faces the whole time I was in there"
I'm getting really angry just thinking about it. There HAS to be a way to start a public out-roar about this.
Happened to me in my sophomore year of high school. Little asshole hit me then I hit him the fuck back. Got suspended for three days.
"I have a friend who got punched in the face and was suspended for ""starting a fight"". He didn't fight back."
Worse when you are the guy running the tow truck to pick up the wreck and idiots want to chat about it while you are loading up a busted ass car in the middle of rush hour traffic.  GTFO
rubbernecking is outdated. Anytime I want to see a decent accident I just go to youtube and watch russian dash cams.
I was stuck in traffic on the interstate the other day not from an accident, which was on the opposite side of the interstate, but from people slowing down to look at said accident. The electronic signs on the interstate were even telling people to stop because it was causing traffic.
Or like my aunt who took pictures of a bad wreck outside her workplace and posted them on Facebook asking for prayers. One of the people later died and she posted the pictures AGAIN to tell everyone. 
Yep, my commute wouldn't have taken so long if there wasn't a bottle neck of everyone slowing down to find out why they're in such traffic.  It makes me crazy, because they're looking at the wreck and then they notice that there's no traffic ahead of them, so time to move along.  AHRK;AJDFHA
"The worst was when I was driving up I-5 towards seattle.  What normally took 45min took 2 hours because a van was on fire, on the frontage road, on the other side of the highway.

It was literally 8 lanes of traffic away from us and people were rubbernecking causing a huge traffic jam on a major interstate."
I actually saw a couple pull over to the side of the road to stop and take pictures of the accident. Whyyyyy
I don't drive, so I don't actually do this myself, but I isn't there a law about slowing down when going past an accident? I mean, I know you're not supposed to stop but aren't you at least supposed to slow down? 
See I have convinced myself that it is actually a little safer this happens. Sure people are slowing down traffic BUT if the person in the wreck, or pulled over, or emergency service people, were to trip or something onto traffic, because people are driving slower and paying attention to them, the reaction will be much better and quicker possibly saving another life. Of course this is countered by the fact that people should be watching the road and not something happening away from them, or the fact that slowing down traffic could cause more accidents, but it really has helped me not get all worked up in traffic. 
In my city this exact behavior causes major traffic jams. There are multiple accidents everyday, idk why folks are still so shocked that they need to rubberneck.
"I was driving down to Texas (Live in OK) for a little vacation. This was about 1 month after the Moore tornado. My wife is driving down the interstate. We hit traffic about 5-6 miles before the path of damage. She gets to the area and slows down to about 25 mph and looks around. 

About 10 seconds later, the lanes clear and there is no more traffic at all. She says ""I wonder what was causing all of that traffic""... SIGH."
"Ha! Few months ago my car broke down, i called service to tow me, but nobody was around the town so it took 1 1/2 hours. Could probably not have counted the amount of people staring at me, cyclists even stopped to stare. 

Goodness guys it's just my engine, no corpses or guts lying around."
This was the reason I was late for a meeting at work today. What is usually a 25-minute commute took an hour. I was fucking furious (at the rubber-neckers, obviously not the people involved in the accident).
"""Come on you dumb mother fucker you never seen an accident before, just drive the car...oh shit look at that, I just slow down a little and see how bad it is..."""
"Exactly what are they looking for? Spank bank material?

If it's a serious wreck, it's one of the most personal moments a person can have. Fuck off with your nosy self. "
"One day I'm going to just plow into someone looking at a wreck and then tell them ""I saw you wanted to see a wreck up close so I obliged"""
Kinda similar, when people don't use blinkers on the interstate or highway. Like, honestly, how hard is it? 
Ugh. I encountered about 6 miles of stop-and-go traffic yesterday on a section of the highway that doesn't usually have traffic even on weekdays. I eventually got far enough to see that it was one person pulled over causing it all! On a four lane highway! God it pisses me off.
"There was recently an incident near me where they had to close off part of the highway due to an accident. I can't remember the exact details of the accident, something about a tire flying off a trailer and hitting a van. I did see the van, I had to drive by because I was on the highway at the time. The window was broken and the roof was almost clean off. Nobody died, thankfully.

Anyhow, I'm passing the accident on the other side of the highway, opposite of where the accident happened. Everyone has slowed down, it's complete fucking gridlock on the side of the highway that is *completely clear*, all because a few people wanted to see the accident.

Even worse? The road running beside the highway was also, rather ironically, jammed because people wanted to get off and avoid traffic."
"I actually got rear-ended by a rubbernecker this past summer.  There was an accident on the other side of the road, I slowed down because someone was trying to turn in front of me, and kid behind me was looking at the accident and ran into me.  

It was pretty awesome."
"This used to piss me off to no end as well until I realized that, in anything beyond medium density traffic, it just takes a few people slowing to cause the problem, and often times it's not so simple as ""I wanted to look"" - more than likely, when the event occurs, it's ""I don't want to be hit by that car which is presently crashing"" or ""I hope that officer doesn't think I was speeding and go after me instead""."
I used to work as a Firefighter/EMT in a backwoods town and we always got some good accidents along a major route that ran through the area (lots of drunks).  I remember one particular wreck during the 4th of July weekend that was just nasty.  Blood and gore everywhere and traffic all backed up.  Well one lady was practically sitting on the sill of her driverside window as she drove by to get a look at the accident, saw more than she bargained for and began vomiting everywhere as she tried to get back inside of her car.  She had to pull over as she continued to puke all over her interior. We had to treat her and bring her to the hospital too.
"Mine is people who are too stupid to understand the road debri risk is much greater following an accident even in the other carriageway. and that my cautious movement is assumed to be ""rubbernecking""

"
"I couldn't figure out why traffic on the highway was so incredibly slow at 2pm.... 

There was a wreck ON THE OTHER FUCKING SIDE. That was literally the only reason. I actually work right across from where it happened, so when I parked my car I stood there and watched. Ahead of the accident it was free and clear. Behind it? Traffic jam. 

People kept slowing down to observe the accident. That's all it was. Nobody was flagging anyone or cautioning traffic, etc. 

Stopping? No, anything at all. It's an accident. Get over it. Do not slow down. Do not stop. Keep fucking going you asshats. "
"In the same kind of idea, people who are obliviously in busy peoples' ways. I was visiting Lombard street in California (the big curvy one) and of course, it's packed. I get almost to the very bottom, when suddenly... A fucktard *gets out of his car* and takes a picture of the street from the bottom.

Commence honkfest."
Yeah, I'm like I don't have time for this...I couldn't care less, I'm just trying to get somewhere! Idiocy!
"It's disgusting. ""Ooh, let me revel in someone's misfortune!!! Did anyone get hurt? Did they? Did they? How bad is it?!?!"" Get a fucking life, douchefucks. "
"Especially during rush hour. 

Motherfucker you'll ride my ass and honk if I go just the speed limit but when there's a fender bender we all gotta slow down because you want to have a look? "
In the city I used to live, if the traffic was a certain kind of slow, you just knew it meant that around the next corner there was a crash on the other side of the divided motorway.
"This is a real problem in my country. It makes an hour-long commute take three hours on a really bad day, because practically all lanes will be closed due to hovering rubber neckers. Some people actually stop next to traffic accidents just to roll down their windows and oggle/take pictures. 

My mom and I were once hit by some teenager texting while driving, and I had to deal with all the rubber neckers stopping on the lane next to us to watch. I cussed out a good deal of them. "
"This caused me to total my car. 

Car in the emergency lane with heavy damage. 

I moved to the middle lane and a few seconds later someone cuts me off and slams on their brakes. 

It was damp and my car didn't have abs. I was legally to blame for that bullshit. "
I hate rubber neckers too but I must admit I'm guilty of it as well. My mentality is that if I had to sit and wait in traffic for a half hour because all these idiots in front of me just had to slow down and check out the accident, well damn it, its my turn to look now and I'm gonna slow down too if I want.

I was driving on the highway this past Sunday and as I slowed down a bit to pass two squad cars who had a car pulled over on the left I realized how rude it would have been if I just blew past them at full speed. Sometimes it's courteous not curiosity.
I think it's law to slow to 20 below the speed limit if there's an emergency vehicle is on the side of the road. A neighbor of mine got a ticket for it. Still think its dumb and I hate idiots who hold up traffic for no reason to look at a crash.
"I can attest to the vast amount of rage this induces. If someone wants to vent on facebook every now and then, whatever. Sometimes you just wanna throw your frustration out into the universe. I get it. 

But people who do this constantly make me want to punch a baby. 
1. There's no way your life is *really* that terrible. 
2. Nobody gives that many shits all the time. 
3. Your portraying yourself in a way that is not beneficial and it lowers people's opinion of you. Perception is everything and you're going to suffer if you don't realize this. "
Or the people that think Facebook is a platform for them to brag about..well, everything.  Good on you for spending the day cleaning.  You're a stay at home mom.  That's pretty much your job.  You made a soup?  Whoopdefuck.  It's soup.  Look at you go.
Used to have a guy on Facebook who made a status about nearly everything that goes wrong, or that he dislikes. Bad weather? He'll complain. Someone in the bus being annoying? He'll complain. Sometimes its a status directed at someone in public, which can be especially annoying. Passive-aggressive statuses suck.
I agree with this, but I also can't stand when people go on facebook and whine about people whining on facebook. My brother in law did this and I had to call him out that he himself was doing exactly what he hated. 
What bothers me more than anything is people who do the same thing, but act like they are better than it all. I get it, hearing everyone post about Miley twerking is annoying, but for God's sake,  yelling at everyone on your Facebook feed just makes you a douche who perpetuates the issue.
"A friend of mine is this exact same way.  Even worse, she'll post a passive aggressive post directed at someone who ""wronged"" her, person finds out and calls her out on it, she blocks them. She'll delete the passive aggressive posts and then post a new status with the persons name for all to see.  She trash talks her boyfriends, her exes, her parents, her friends...all the time. She's 25 and her posts mirror an angsty 15 year old on LiveJournal."
I agree completely. Or when people only post about their personal problems. It's personal keep it to yourself! 
"I get so fucking sick of people that think their lives are so god damn hard. Some people have real problems. 

I'm sorry your latte was 10 degrees too hot this morning."
Putting up a depressing comment every now and again is fine but when it is like 2-6 times a day it just turns into annoying cries for attention. People should not feed the fire by commenting on the status, just pm them.
I can't even get on Facebook anymore without rage-quitting.  The kind of dumb shit people spout on their public diary is something I could give a fuck less about.  Unless you're doing something cool or visiting an exotic place then keep your dumb thoughts to yourself.
Yep.  Same thing here.  That usually gets them deleted from my friends list along with more than one cat picture a day and reposting hoax posts after I have dinged them for it previously.
When they decide to post a facebook status about a person, but don't say their name or anything.  Or if they post something to get attention..ughhhh just stfu!
"Or, add to that, people who are vaguely dramatic on Facebook.  The BS like ""worst day ever. I don't even want to talk about it.""
"
"Or those people who post ""nobody talk to me"" statuses. If you don't want interaction, then stay off Facebook. "
"My favorite status about that is ""I guess I'm the one no one wants... At least I have my cat""

This said by a girl who makes no attempt to socialize."
"A pirate walks into a bar with a steering wheel in his pants.

Bartender asks what is that for?

Argh it drives me nuts"
I remove people that bore the hell out of me from my stream, so I don't see their updates any more. It's a bit less extreme than unfriending and get's the job done.
"Ohemgee. One of my friends is fixin to get cussed out. She married a man who was sent to prison for 8 years (while he was incarcerated) then shockingly they broke up. So she srarted dating another guy. Guess they broke up because she ""woke up crying missing him so bad"" and doesnt know why she cant fknd a good guy"
"Dear sweet jesus.

I have a...well she used to be a friend...
She seriously always has to complain about something on facebook.  Nothing is ever okay, something's wrong, her life is hard blah blah blah.  She honestly has her whole college being paid for (and she is taking her sweet time, not even a bachelor's at 25) they pay for her car and gas to drive back from school on weekends or off days (the 1.5hr one way commute) and pay for her apartment so she can live off campus with friends.    
SHE GETS A GODDAMN ALLOWANCE AS WELL.

Almost a year ago she invited my boyfriend and I over for casual drinking and whatnot.  Proceeds to explode into screamfest 2012 because we brought up a mutual friend of ours that she doesn't like.

The next day, she bitches on facebook about how much her life sucks because she might lose friends over a little drinking.

This past Saturday she shows up to a Halloween party at a friend of mine's with her boyfriend - who is my ex from 5/6 years ago old highschool sweethearts, she has a bad habit of dating guys I have already tossed to the side - and then at the end of the night has a fucking freak out and says he is no longer allowed to speak to me and that he must be trying to fuck me.  Believe me, we are just friends and hardly that, we never see each other anymore.  I barely spoke 20 words to him all night and hung out with others.

Cuntcanoe is on facebook the next day whining because she is upset that she has a hard time controlling her emotions and ""accidentally"" flipped out over something that wasn't even the issue she was upset about.  So as usual, all of her family and friends are commenting and liking the status telling her it's okay, even though she caused a huge scene at an otherwise fun as fuck party."
"I fucking hate when people post passive-aggressive ""I have a problem with you but I'm not in anyway showing that I have a problem by not addressing it to anybody"" it's like a subtle stab in the back, a silent ""fuck you"". Just grow a fucking pair and tell them, life isn't an extended edition of mean girls. Come On!

/Rant  "
It is especially aggravating when those posts are really vague and are actually begging for a follow up question like: 'my life sucks, I can't believe he did that!'
"It's like they have different personas. In real life they are really cool and happy, then on twitter/facebook they're all like ""FUCK MY LIFE, I HATE EVERYBODY SO MUCH"" then you see them in real life and say what's wrong then they look at you like your crazy and say ""nothing, why?"" WTF THEN STOP BEING SO GODDAMN DRAMATIC. "
"I know a girl who had a miscarriage and posted a photo of the fetus on Facebook. the caption said something along the lines of ""rip my son"""
"God dam this aggravates me to no end, a ""peppy"" girl recently posted a status about ""how Fucking stupid"" it is that you get in trouble for 5+ tardies, then gets pissy when I pointed out that most people can make it on time, why can't she"
"God this one complaining bitch constantly updates her Facebook with things like ""I feel like I'm going end it all"" 2 hours later ""Today was one of the greatest days of my life"" to another hour later ""I can't believe you would even do that."" and not even explain any of the situation and make it obvious that it was meant for a specific person."
Also those people on Facebook who tell people to stay out of their business, but then put it all on Facebook. 
I agree that it's annoying but I think some people are so lonely that they need something, *anything* to express their feelings to. Even just in expressing the way you feel into written or spoken words you are acknowledging that a) your problems exist and b) that they are real problems that can be solved, *you* may even solve your problems just by reading them.
Or the people who let everyone know that they ate 3 scrambled eggs and 2 pieces of toast. Fuck your breakfast.
Do you know what bothers me? Whiny people who complain about their facebook friends instead of removing them.
lmao you ARE the little whiny bitch.  Just instead of using facebook, you come to reddit, the difference is superficial. 
Yes this is extremely annoying, but not as much as the people that post all their personal crap on facebook then get mad when people comment or tell people about what they are posting.  Example being a person I know is going through a divorce and is constantly posting stuff about her ex and talking about her new boyfriend, but got mad when people told her she was wrong and went back and told her ex what she is saying about him.  If you don't want people in your personal life then don't post it on a freaking social media site. 
Do you mean spoiled to the point where they dont appreciate things? Because spoiled children are ok if they appreciate it and aren't being a brat about the simplest things

"Alternatively, people that speed up to match your speed when you're passing. 

Both situations are rage inducing. "
The absolute worst version of this is driving to Tahoe, much of the last leg of the trip is a two lane road. Without fail every time there will be some schmuck driving to slow and causing a bit of a build up behind him. That doesn't bother me, some people get nervous and that's fine. The problem is that when the pack gets to a quick passing lane opening, the lead driver speeds up so that only the first car or two can actually pass him if they fucking draft him and punch the gas. As soon as the the passing lane ends the lead driver slows back down, while a row of cars behind him are all banging their heads against their steering wheels. 
"Mine is people who pass me because I leave a gap to the next car, but I'm going the speed of that car.

no, you have to be bumper to bumper at all times."
"you have to understand that people do that not because they're trying to piss you off, but because they're stupid and can only judge their velocity by other cars on the road, and unless their eyes are glued on the speedometer they're so bad at driving that they can't keep their foot on the gas for a constant speed

source: living in the flatest of all lands and using cruise control, and observing retarded drivers"
Or when you're on the free way and there is a person in the left lane going the speed limit or slower. I often drive from Dallas to Houston on I-45, which the majority of the way is 2 lanes. So frustrating. 
That happened to me a few times. One time it was a woman in an Audi. She overtook me on a roundabout (instead of the long straight afterwards), cutting me up in the process so I had to brake. Then she drove at 55mph the whole of the rest of the 60pmh zone, when there was no opportunity for me to overtake her once we'd passed the long straight (which she travelled at 62 on so I couldn't pass her).
I wish more people would use cruise control and maintain their speed (instead of this *speed up, slow down, speed up, slow down* nonsense) on the highway, and to stay the hell out of the left lane!
"This is a daily occurrence for me on my way to and from work.

 I drive with cruise control too, so I *know* they're being asshats"
That happens to me during swim team all the time, I pass someone in the lane or tap their feet to pass them and they speed up so they have to pass me back and they slow down.... 
Also, people who haul ass to pass you, then immediately make a turn right in front of you!  Were those extra 4 seconds gonna kill em?
We have a road that's a single lane either way except for a passing zone every ten miles. I always get stuck behind the asshole going below the speed limit on the one lane stretch, but then speeds fuck up when we get to the passing as zone making it impossible to get by them.
I 'love' when I have my cruise control set to 10 above the speed limit and I pass the same person 3-4 times on the way to work...pick a speed and stay there.
"Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?

-Gorge Carlin

     -Michael Scott"
"I get this, even on a bicycle. It seems like drivers have a compulsion to overtake me just because I'm on a bike, but when there's heavy traffic, or the speed limit's 30 (mph) or below, you're gonna see me again pretty soon. 

Also, it doesn't induce rage in me for obvious reasons, but buses are by far the worst culprit!"
Better yet, when I signal to change lanes and the person behind me takes it as their cue to speed up and block my opening. 
I drive on I-95 from Winterport (Exit 174) to Augusta (Exit 109) every day and this happens constantly. I fucking hate people.
"I'm going to speak for the other side of the drivers: they're doing it just for the fun of it. When I was driving home on the interstate about a week ago, late at night, I sped past someone, then let them pass me, and then sped past them, and then let them pass me...

It was a dick move, but it kept me entertained for the drive home, and it was relatively safe due to low traffic."
Or fucking people who sit in the passing lane going as fast as the person  in the slow lane. God damnit just pass and move over!!
Maine drivers are assholes? If you are from New England, why are you singling out Mainers? Shouldn't Massholes be the target of your wrath?
Several trips across the country spawned literally dozens of situations exactly like this.  On open road, me with the cruise control set to the exact speed limit for stress-free driving.  I kind of found it hilarious.
"I remember once I was driving to Orlando and set my cruise control and just mozied up the highway in the cruising (right) lane. Some guy passes me, then slows down,  so I get into the passing lane (left) and get in front of him, and get back in the cruising lane since I'm going faster.

He passes me again and gets in front of me again. I pass him again. This continues for a good 10 minutes until he's screaming and flipping me off the last time he passes me. Finally I say ""fuck this shit"" and take off cruise control, fly by him until I'm a good quarter mile up, and put cruise control back on again, at the same speed I was to start. He didn't pass me again but to this day I have no idea what was going on. I remember even checking my phones speedo (I think it ran off gps?) just to make sure my cruise control wasn't messed up.

Not sure which pissed me off more, him driving like an idiot, or having the balls to be pissed at my cruise control loving ass."
I hate people who drive slow, and the speed up the second you try to pass them.  Happens constantly in Oregon.
Even worse: when people pull out right in front of you when there isn't a single car for miles behind you only to go ten under the speed limit. Seriously, wait two fucking seconds for me to pass.
"Aside from the last part, I tend to do this to people because they don't realize they're slowing down until I pass them. I use cruise control often when I drive. I know I'm going at the same speed, regardless of hills. Others however, tend to slow down on inclines (as do I, without cruise control). If I end up behind someone like that, my choices are to turn off cruise control or pass them, so I pass.

Once the incline goes away though (often not too long after I pass them), they gain 10mph and start creeping up behind me. So in their minds, I passed them and slowed down. When the entire time, I kept to a fixed speed (except during the pass). "
This use to happen all the time when I drove my dad big loud  truck. I would be going along pass a guy(I am a girl) then all of the suddenly he is speeding up and passing me.  
"Okay three things-

.1.  They don't *mean* to be an asshole, they just lost their frame of reference for how fast they're going (ie. You).  They're not assholes doing it on purpose.

.2.  The reason many people speed up when you try to pass them isn't because they're assholes, it's because they just realized ""Oh shit!  I'm an asshole who's driving too slow!""  So... maybe they're assholes, but not for the reason you think.

.3.  If you're talking about the left lane on a highway, then no.  10 miles over the speed limit is **NOT** fast enough.  We can all talk about how ""if you're going 56, you're breaking the law"" but the left lane is for passing, the middle lane is for cruising, and the right lane is for entering/exiting the highway.  If you aren't passing the guy on your right, you shouldn't be in that lane, and if there's no one on your right, you shouldn't be in that lane."
"Was driving back to Vancouver from Prince George the other day with my Dad from hunting in a '99 Ford Super Duty, fully loaded with a cab-over truck camper and a fully covered quad trailer, basically makes it gigantic. Anyway we were starting to pass this semi-truck in a passing lane and guess what we see beside us? Flashing orange lights pointed in our direction. We slowed way down so that he wouldn't merge into us but he saw us and motioned to let us pass, but my Dad (who was driving) just said something along the lines of ""Fuck you, just go.."" He didn't pull that stunt when we passed him the next time but we made sure to blast past him almost hitting the trucks governor (86mph) in case he did.

He had one of those ""How's My Driving?"" signs on the back of his trailer with a phone number, I was going to call him and tell him hes an asshole who should have never gotten a big rig license but I forgot what it was."
Along the same lines, people who speed up and squeeze in front of you to exit on the freeway when there are no cars behind you!
Fuck, I had this guy in front of me doing 67, I'm doing ~69-70. About to pass, he switches lanes (no one else within a half mile mind you) to the left lane and SLOWS DOWN. To 58. 58 IN THE LEFT LANE. I passed on the right, too much of a hazard to be behind.
"in my experience, Maine drivers are too slow. True to the ""Vacationland"" motto, they all drive like they have nowhere important to be anytime in the near future. "
"Subset of people who think driving is a battle of egos. We'd halve the road toll if everyone just focused on their own driving.

edit: yes this includes pricks who tap their brakes if they deem that the person behind is too close"
Living up and down my road, the speed limit is 40. I do like 50-55 going to 8 AM classes because it's a 20 min drive, and this morning some dude in a FERD FTEENTHOUSAND comes flying around me. I don't know why but this shit pisses me off to no end. From Mississippi, with hate. 
That happens down here in Virginia too. Maybe it's an east coast thing, or maybe that's just all drivers in general...
When you have a clear road(no stop signs), and someone at a crossroad with a stop sign decides to turn onto your lane at the last damn second! 
Fuck driving in Maine and fuck the I -95. Long-ass stretch of highway width nothing but closed rest stops for miles.
People who drive in the passing lane when they aren't passing, and there are people right on their asses!

"My girlfriend does this, I absolutely hate it. Got no drivers etiquette. ""you've heard of cruise control, right?"""
This happens all this time in Maine! I drive a Prius and all the pickup truck drivers loveeee to do this me.

This happens constantly. And in Australia it costs $25 a ticket (if in 3D). I didn't not work my butt off for an hour, just to go to the movies and hear a bunch of people talk through a movie!
"I have a friend that does this and always argues with, ""bro, calm down, it's just a stupid movie.""

But ask him how much butter he wants on his popcorn during one of *his* movies, and he'll press scene skip backwards and make everyone re-watch the last ten minutes.

Similarly, people not paying attention. I know it shouldn't affect me at all, but it does. My friend was on his phone throughout the finale of Breaking Bad and then had loads of questions at the end. Good lord, that annoyed me.
*Especially* when watching a movie you've already seen before and something important is going to happen.
"I went see Gravity in 3D IMAX (WORTH IT) and there was an Asian couple in front of me. The girl kept talking to her boyfriend (in another language) and I kept shushing, feeling incredibly rude because the movie is so damn quiet. Eventually I tapped her on the shoulder and scared the shit out of her accidentally and whispered ""Please stop talking."" 

It felt real nice. "
Or during class. In one of my classes this semester there are two people that sit in the back and hold a regular conversation at a fairly loud level EVERY DAY. The professor tells them to stop after a while, but has to tell them every single week. It's annoying. People look at them and tell them to shut up, but they don't listen and smart off to people. Don't be an ass, some people are trying to listen.
"It happens, and I will ask them to stop.

Usually, they apologise and stop, (some people just don't realise anyone else can hear them)

I did have one guy who stopped for about 5 mins then started talking again, to I turned to him and just said ""HEY"" he looked in in the eye I gave him a ""c'mon man"" shrug and he stopped.

Dont put up with that crap."
Someone brought their 4 year old talkative daughter to the premier of World War Z.  The entire film, her dad/grandfather (Couldn't tell which) made no effort to silence her.  She literally ruined the film.
I threw popcorn at someone talking in the theater. Old trick, they got the message. He even told his friend to stop talking.
"> movies and hear a bunch of people t

or doing a lecture , seriously , the day has 24 hours where you can talk about anything you want , but please , during those 1.5 hour lecture ? 
shut the fuck up"
"""Hey do you guys want to watch a movie with us?""
""No, we're good. Thanks though!""

*halfway through the movie they come in and hover by the couch*

""Who's that? Why is she crying? Why are they driving so fast? They could have just gone left there and he wouldn't have gotten shot. etc etc"""
"Light whispering in a movie theater has always annoyed me but I try to do my best to ignore it or offer a curt ""shh!"".

Then, a few weeks ago, I encountered the rarest, most blatant act of rudeness I've seen in a long time. We were watching ""Way way back"" in a rather small theater. There was a woman there, dressed in scrubs, accompanying a group of 3 or 4 mentally retarded adults. Halfway through the movie, her cell phone rings. She answers it and proceeds to conduct a full on, regular volume, in depth conversation with her mother about picking up the kids and stopping at the gas station and such. Right in the middle of the fucking movie theater.

I guess it was because everyone was so completely stunned at this woman, but nobody actually got up and walked over to her and told her ""you need to take that outside"". I'm surprised nobody walked over and screamed in her fucking face. I'm surprised *I* didn't. No, people around her kept ""SHHH!"" at her, someone tossed a few kernels of popcorn at her, this went on for five or ten minutes until she finally got up and went outside. I couldn't believe it, and on the way home I was kind of ashamed at myself for not doing anything about it.

I seriously was astounded at the level of rudeness."
Even worse-- when people bring their kids to the movies and don't contain them when they are being loud. 
As an offshoot of that, people just being loud when it's generally common courtesy to keep your volume level down. My roommate is consistently loud and unaware of how loud he's being on a fairly regular basis.
"Good lord, I went to see The Lion King on Broadway in NYC on Sunday night and some asshole started singing along with ""Can you feel the love tonight"" right behind me. I shot him a flaming glare so full of hatred that it probably singed his eyebrows. He promptly shut up. Bitch, if I wanted to hear you sing I'd be paying YOU $100 and you'd be on stage. STFU. "
To add to the movie theme, when the rest of the theater is empty but someone decides to sit directly in front of you or behind you.
The worst is people who fucking cheer, I am a HUGE batman fan, so naturally I saw the dark knight rises at midnight premiere. Everytime something remotely significant happened (like when you first see batman in the suit, or when the bag is pulled off to reveal bane, or the first time we saw Christian bale on screen), people would cheer and it got annoying, when I can't hear the fucking dialogue because people are acting like twats. Seriously fuck those kinds of people.
Or when im trying to watch a PG 13 movie, someone brings their 8 year old kids in and they laugh to every sex joke.
Yeah, sorry. I'm one of those people. I at least try to keep it to a whisper. The people who speak at a normal volume (or worse, intentionally project) are just being dicks.
Yes! I hate it when my bestfriend, grilfriend and I are watching a series on Netflix and no body is watching it besides me. Instead they are talking or doing other shit I take my shows/movies seriously.
Fucking Gravity last weekend. GRAVITY of all movies! Two older dudes and some lady practically non stop talking. Even during the extremely silent parts. I shushed loudly twice, but I shouldn't have been that polite and just told them to shut the hell up. 
"A couple friends and I went to see a movie one evening and during the very climactic and emotional scene of the film, he leaned over my sister to  say to me, ""SO MANY FEELS, RIGHT?"" It was the fucking worst. "
This comment will get shot to hell but.....When I go to the movies with my best friends. Our favorite part is making jokes throughout the movie. Makes it better. We try and do it at an low volume, not really sure how people take it.
"Stage actor.

When I hear this on stage, my first thought is taking the Elizabethan sword I'm holding and plunging it through their chest."
I absolutely can't keep my mouth shut during movies. So I never go to theaters and if I do watch a movie...I do it alone. I'm bad at movies. 
I remember my dad one time. He has a Trailer Park Boys ringtone on his phone. Its one of Laheys shitisms. Anyways, dumbass Dad didn't turn phone off, and it went off. God it was embarrassing but I was also pissed. The looks didn't help
I had these 2 drunk girls sit beside me during The Conjuring, fuck those liquor smelling bitches, still mad they ruined the movie, packed theater and didn't want to leave, I really wanted to see it. 
"In the same vein, people that clap at the end of a movie. Makes me irrationally angry. Who are you clapping for? They can't hear you, the guy running the projector isn't watching, the rest of us have been sitting here watching the same movie, we know if it was good or not. And why are you clapping for a horror movie? What the hell is wrong with you?

Stop fucking clapping!!!! See, irrational anger."
"I can understand during a movie at a movie theater. But I had a roommate who would get mega pissed at anyone who spoke while watching a movie in the living room. Made me livid when he would give dirty looks or shush someone in a room of like 5 people watching a movie. **What if I want to talk to my friends about the fucking movie we are experiencing together** fuckoff with your sitting in silence for 2 hours while you watch a movie made many years ago. If you miss some minor detail while you and your friends are enjoying each other's company then you can find something new if you decide to watch the movie **ever again**. 



**""YOU MUST WATCH AND ENJOY THE MOVIE THE WAY I WANT YOU TO SIT AND ENJOY THE MOVIE!""**"
In a theater, i agree.  At home, i like talking about the concepts a movie is going through while we're watching it.  Turns it into more of a shared experience rather than just each one of us hearing the same story independently.
I made the mistake of having several people over to watch Breaking Bad. A couple of them nearly lost their lives when they decided to talk/text in the dark room/make noise. It's the final few episodes, jackass!
I don't know why, but apparently in African American culture it's common to cheer, shout, etc. during movies. Drives me fucking crazy.
I started sitting away from people so they don't hear my stupid so they don't hear my stupid comments. 
I hate this too. The only exception is when a movie sucks and black people are talking and making funny comments. 
"In this situation, you glare just over their shoulder and walk with purpose. Square your shoulders. 

You are now a train. Fuck the people who don't move."
Shit, I'm a fast walker, and get this all the time, some people just have the brains of cattle when it comes to walking, so fucking ragey.
I can't count the amount of times someone has stopped so suddenly that I've walked into them and then they have the nerve to give me a dirty look. 
"I hate people like that. All I wanna do is yell ""MOVE."" and scare the piss out of them just so I can get by."
My school. I hope no one gets their license... They walk all over the place and on the wrong side of the hall..
"The wall of friends. Omg. I get enraged. When I walk to class with a friend, and someone is coming, we single file until we pass them. It's like people can't stand to not be a part of their group of 5 friends for 2 seconds. 

Also, the people who try to rush into a lecture hall before the people can leave it. Dude, you're 10 minutes early to class anyway, chill out. "
People who do both! They walk faster to get past you, see their friend coming the other way and stop to talk, blocking your way (and everyone else). Seriously, so many people do this where I work. They are largely East Europeans, but we have a lot of East Europeans at work, so it may or may not be a cultural thing.
"What works for me, is following them uncomfortably close (like right on their heels). Once you enter their personal space bubble, they tend to realize, ""oh hey, there are other people here in this public space. Let's not walk 4 people across and take up the whole sidewalk."""
"My favorite (douchy) move is to loudly proclaim ""Walk slower.  You're too far away from the center of the aisle to move this fast. Everybody behind you will thank you for reducing their progress and increasing their wait time.""

Some people think I'm a dick (true), but I find it effective."
As a pedestrian, I tailgate. I walk uncomfortably close to the oblivious meanderers in the hope that they'll speed up or pull over to let me pass. Like true tailgating, it never happens. Instead I get pedestrian rage, but instead of beeping, I mutter 'oh for fuck's sake, open your eyes you dumbasses' and gently sob into the crook of my arm.
I'm pretty good about navigating around other people, especially in a busy downtown area. But every once in a while, you get those window shoppers who slow down at a store front and crane their heads. Halts the whole flow of foot traffic. And there's always a gaggle of 'em, like they roam in packs. And just as I'm about to pass around them, the one ooh-ing and ahh-ing the most just has to take a step back into my path. They wear horrible perfume. Even after I say excuse me they still don't notice they aren't the only ones out that day. What gets me the most is that it never bothers them.
Hehehe, my bro and I used to intentionally bro hug for a long ass time in the walkway, and if anyone else called us out they were homophobes. I've since stopped doing that, as... well... it's very dickish.
This is the worst during tourist season. I swear to god there will be 5 tourists blocking the entire sidewalk just staring at the concrete, DO YOU NOT HAVE CONCRETE WHERE YOU COME FROM?!?!?!
"it annoys me that no matter what the size of the group in front of you, or the size of the hallway, sidewalk or path, they will spread out to fill all available space. 

it annoys the shit out of me, and mostly because my kids do it. They can't see the people walking towards them, and aren't aware of the people behind them, so just walk wherever the fuck they want. This makes me think that 80% of people walking in the street have the situational awareness of 7 year old blond girls"
In my town we have clearly marked bike lanes next to side walks and a heavy bike commuter population. For whatever reason motherfuckers always want to stroll down the bike path, usually with their earbuds in, like they own the place. If you say something to get them to move, they're slow at reacting and you never know which way they'll go. So, nine times out of ten you just have to haul by them and hope they don't change directions. 
I remember, when I first went to middle school, a group of dumbass girls just stood there...talking...BITCH I HAVE ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO POOP, GET OUTTA THE WAY.
"An addendum: people walking or driving who do not look behind them.  Talk about selfish narcissism!  ""Only where I'm going matters.  Fuck anyone who thinks I'm in their way."""
Makes me wonder if that's how they drive. It's fucking road rage in the hallways. If you're gonna walk at grandma speed, get outta the fast lane.
Particularly tourists who stop suddenly in the middle of the sidewalk to consult a map. Or, even worse, who walk backwards into the road because they're trying to line up a photo.
My God I was running late for class today and there were these 2 girls talking and walking very slowly, obstructing the walkways... I steamrolled through them after about 30s of waiting... Such infuriating... 
This is why I hate malls. Nothing like someone speeding passed you, just to suddenly stop right in front to check out something shiny. 
"Step one: extend arms horizontally 
Step two: clap hands together, turning yourself into a wedge
Step three: plow through groups while yelling nonsensical noises. 
60% of the time, it works every time."
As someone who rides their bike to school every day, fuck those people. I hate people that park their car on the sidewalk and I have to go onto the highway to go around.
"The worst is when it's a line of teenage girls, tittering amongst themselves as they occupy the entire aisle like a scene from some Sex in the City Episode. 

A small ""Excuse me, can I get through?"" usually works, but one time they merely looked and smirked.

""BITCHES, GETCHYO DUMB BLONDE ASSES OUT MA WAY."""
Or when a group is walking abreast and taking up the whole damn hallway.  SINGLE FILE MOTHER FUCKERS!
"Yes! And in addition: people who unpredictably change pace/direction... ""let me just walk past you real qui... Oops apparently I'm not... I'll just walk this way the... Oops, you suddenly stopped walking"""
people do this where i work.  There is room in even the most narrow hallways for people to pass each other.  either idiots walk abreast of each other and no one can get by, or you get the fat fuck walking down the middle of the hall, heavy breathing and blocking all foot traffic.
"Normally I'm a very calm person. However, every single time this happens I turn into a lava-spewing hatecano of rage and bile. JUST FUCKING MOVE FOR FUCK'S SAKE ARHGHHGHGGG. 

shit pisses me off. "
Or those idiots who seem to think the middle of the road is a good time to stop their car and have a conversation. 
"This alongside people who aren't ready to pay for their shit by the time a cashier rings it up are definitely my biggest pet peeves when dealing with people in public.

I get it: you're just counting down the days until you die, moving from one small hell to another in the wreckage that is your failed attempt at a meaningful life. *FINE*. But *I still have shit to get done* so *get out of the fucking way.*"
"My husband gets angry, and starts talking shit about it so they can hear. I generally will squeeze by while saying ""**excuse me**"" loudly enough, and with enough irritation in my voice that they should understand that they are inconveniencing others, and thus being dicks."
"I missed a train yesterday because of this. I got home about a half-hour late because of it. I went from driving home in the beginning dregs of rush hour to full-on, what-is-driving, mile-long line of cars rush hour.

Many obscenities were uttered once I got to the privacy of my vehicle."
And in that vein, people who walk a foot behind me instead of going around when there's a wide path. Or just invading my personal space in general.
And then they act all patronizing when you ask politely. I have to leave this thread, I'm getting too angry. 
"I am also in this situation where I walk fast enough that walkways simulate highways. I think that we need to start repercussions for this, because people also text and walk just as, or moreso, terribly as they text and drive. 

So many times have I gone to walk past them and they're texting and they 'swerve' in front of me. I hate you all."
People who walk slowly down the middle of the lane in a parking lot, instead of walking to the left or right side so cars can park. 
"Also: Being in a group of 'friends' who I don't really know very well, and would feel awkward outright telling them to speed up, but who just dawdle at about half the speed of me falling asleep... I have a very swift/long stride, so unless I'm feeling really lazy, dawdling walking frustrates me SO much. Even if I'm not wanting to go very fast myself, having to consciously correct my walking speed is really irritating.

Being in a crowd of people is fairly frustrating, but through being in school, I have learned to master the art of weaving through people. Or, if the situation is right, I am excellent at BUNDLE!"
i perceive the sidewalk like a road... stay on the right side of the direction you are travelling (in this country).. when people are walking 3 or 4 abreast.. i stand my ground and usually end up shoulder checking someone... and keep stridin on!
"Tourists who stop at the entrance/exit of an escalator to take a picture. You're getting shouldered, buddy. People trying to get to work here. 

Don't give me your self righteous ""Uh, *excuse* *you!*"" after the impact either. You know damn well you're being a inconvenience to everyone else who's trying to go about their day. We're trying to get to work here. 
"
I sometimes wish it was legal for me to pounce slow walkers and bite their throats out to clear a path. Survival of the fastest.
I was trying to get to class when a **literal crowd** was standing on the only stairs to get to the basement. So I ~~calmly walked~~ straight Assassin's Creeded through the crowd, and they were so confused. It was hilarious seeing their reactions.
It's always the fat black girls.  They walk 5 wide down the hallway as slowly and loudly as possible.
This x1000. Or people that walk in groups 3-4+ wide down the footpath, seriously wtf is wrong with these people.
"One time I was in a car with my uncle, he was trying to find a parking space in the mall parking lot but there was a man standing in front of our car. My uncle yelled ""Move before I move you, MOTHERFUCKER"" as he thought that the window was closed but it was open. If you had seen his face it would have been a mix of sharting your self and those times when you were a little kid and you go to your mom and hold her hand in public only to find out its not your mom. The man chased us but my uncle drove at 20m/h.We got away. my uncle has lots of hilarious stories like when he ran the car into a plastic sewer pipe and the pipe broke. He stood there with two other men with shit on the car 2 metres away from them saying ""What idiot could have done this!How does he have a licence"" I told the men the truth as my uncle kept on lying."
"I feel like I've gotten really bad about reacting to this. I've gotten into the habit of just plowing by people or loudly saying ""'scuse me"" while I wedge my way between them without any change in my pace. I know I should ""relax and smell the roses"", but it's not cool to walk shoulder-to-shoulder, 5 people wide, barely moving down a heavily used sidewalk. Makes my blood boil."
Or a crowded place like an airport and the person you're walking behind just randomly stops to check their phones.
"I was passing through a mall, the other day, trying to get to my bus stop. The hall was maybe 10 ft wide, and I was walking along the wall.

Some wannabe gangsta kid is walking towards me, on a trajectory that will see him collide with my arm. I obviously have nowhere to go, because I cannot phase through the walls - he, however, has 9 ft of open hallway to his side. We make eye contact, briefly.

This pompous twit expected me to flinch to make way for his massive ego and exaggerated swagger, when he could easily move out of the way. Hell no.

I don't think he was expecting to be shoulder checked."
"When you start walking towards the people who won't move just start yelling ""NOT MOVING! NOT MOVING"" which leaves them two options: Get walked the fuck over or move."
"Im pretty anxious about these things. Because of this i walk extremely fast and get sweaty and tired because im afraid someone behind me is gonna want me to keep moving ><

Half the time i dont even look behind me to make sure thats true or not."
Aw, once you graduate high school or college, you'll be privy to the real issue: people who obstruct or walk too slowly on sidewalks.
People who walk in the opposite direction of normal traffic. In the UK, that'd be the right lane. I shouldn't have to zigzag my way to work, be gone bitches.
Oh man, I hate this. I also hate the people who don't understand the concept of walking one way on the right side and the other way on the left side.
"I always mumble just loud enough so they can hear me ""Any fucking slower and we are going backwards..."""
"Bring in a candy bar and yell ""Hey everyone! There's a guy giving out candy in the main office! (or whatever you call it) Hurry or you'll miss him/her! That might clear the halls. "
"When people that make a left turn in the hallway cut the corner and run into me coming from the other side.

God damn it people learn to walk on the right side of the hall and make a wide left turn to avoid collisions."
Conversations in doorways. Holy fuck....lets stop and retell our life story in the middle of the god dam door
fucking old people.... They look like they don't know shit when it comes to a bunch of people shuffling behind them trying to get by, buy they know, they definitely fucking know. 
"And they always stand in the middle of the fucking hallway. Goddam, move to the side and take your time there, dont slow everyone else down!

Also drives me insane when people congregate around bottlenecks in pathways. Like a narrow pathway in a grocery store. IM TRYING TO PASS THROUGH, YOU FUCKS ARE REMINISCING ABOUT SHIT, GO STAND AROUND SOMEWHERE ELSE!!"
I hurt my school's starting middle linebacker's shoulder last week and he had to sit the game because I threw him out of the way in the hallway. I didn't know it was him but he was standing and laughing too loudly (he's an asshole) in the middle of the hallway so I pushed him. I'm glad it was him because he's a dick. It just makes me mad when someone stands stupidly in a narrow hallway during a passing period. 
There's a woman i work with that is vehemently proud about the fact that she cannot set an alarm clock on a clock or phone. She still asks her mother to call and wake her up for work, if her husband cannot. She's over 40 and has a family.
"I can't stand when people chew with their mouth open, it sounds like a baboon chewing on party poppers!

I lose all sanity."
"""Haha im so computer illiterate lol""

Being proud of being computer illiterate is like being proud of being ACTUALLY illiterate. "
Oh man, those types who go out of their way to eat crap because the gummerment isn't going to tell them what they can eat.  Then, they share that lifestyle with their children.
As someone who works in a crowded lab full of Asians (literally, I am the only American), I feel your pain with the chewing problem. I have to leave the lab around lunch time because when they all start eating together, it is just unbearable.
"Regarding the second point, people citing religious belief as fact that my oh so simple mind can't wrap around.

""But it's right there in the BIBLE!"""
In this vein, college students who brag about how much they skip class or do the bare minimum to pass the class. 
"I leave the room, or stare at them until they stop. One of my employees does this, and not just chewing with his mouth open, but the full smacking and everything. 

We don't invite him to lunch."
My friend's daughter is 12 and is the sloppiest eater I have ever seen, and it's no wonder why. I have not EVER seen her eat with her mouth closed. She has never corrected her either. Her new husband is the same way, but she constantly bitches at him for it. I'm like, WTF? Correct your damn daughter!
My roommate during college smacked his lips so fucking loud when eating. It was like a cow eating whatever they eat. If we were watching tv or something you couldn't even hear whatever we were watching.
There is a special place in hell for people that proudly wave their stupidity/ignorance flag.  Best yet? When they make fun you for education or intelligence or desire to learn. Wtf?!
"I only recently found out I chew with my mouth open. Drove my boyfriend's family nuts last Christmas.

Funny thing is, my mother never once pointed it out and she used to give me Emily Post books and pretend like we were high class."
I have chronically non-functioning sinuses. Sometimes I need to open my mouth while chewing so I don't suffocate. Sorry if that causes some folks to rage, but bitches gotta breathe.
"This comes up EVERY. FUCKING. THREAD. I CANNOT CHEW WITH MY MOUTH CLOSED BECAUSE I WILL SUFFOCATE.


I think I found a new thing that instantly makes me angry."
I cannot close my mouth all the way due to facial nerve damage, and I am SO self-conscious about eating around other people because of it. Not all open-mouth chewers have a choice, sadly.
What if  said person's nose is blocked? and has to breathe through their mouth and chew at the same time?
I'm now a lot more desensitized to people who chew with their mouth open, but when they also **breathe so heavily through their nose they're practically snorting** - I just want to slam their heads into their plates.
"Do I hate people chewing with their mouth open. I ask them how the food tastes, and after they say 'good', I say, ""Sounds like it."" Usually, shuts them up."
">And proudly stupid people

When my sister and I fight and I call her out on being a bitch, she says she knows shes a bitch but theres nothing she can do.. Instant rage. Like how can you not fix that and why are you proud of that fact
 "
I have a colleague that chews with her mouth open and talks ALWAYS when she puts food in her mouth. It's disgusting. 
I'm entitled to my completely uninformed and biased opinion! Leave me to my homeopathic remedies, climate change denial, and alternative medicine.
"Definitely. I'll add stubborn ignorance. The kind where even in the face of all logic and reason he/she still chooses to believe things like ""all twins have the same personality"" or something. They could thoroughly read an entire encyclopedia and proudly declare they have learned nothing."
Them not being courteous enough to think about your time, is something to get upset about. It is them saying that you have nothing better to do in that 40 min than wait on them. Pisses me off too. 
I get furious when people waste my time or when I waste someone else's time. Time is the most valuable resource and everyone's time is equally important.
I used to be friends with this girl who did this and wore it like a Badge of Honor. She would literally brag about it to me. That and how long it took her to get ready to go out. Bitch, seriously?
"My sister will lie.  ""If I say that I'll be there in 10 minutes, they're not as mad on the phone.""  

Maybe they're not as mad when you call to tell them that you're almost there, but every minute after that only magnifies the anger.  I am WAY angrier when she finally arrives than if she'd told me she'd be an hour.  10 minutes? I can't do much but idly reddit.  An hour? Netflix time.  "
"What's even worse is when I've been staying at my grandparent's for a month, and my mom comes to pick me up. She tells me to get ready, so I get all my shit together and now I'm wearing a backpack and duffleback that are so god damn heavy I can barely carry them.  

""You ready to go?""  Yes.  ""K, stand there while I talk to my mom for 2 hours."""
I don't understand why people feel the need to lie about it. Going to be an hour late? No worries, I can use that time doing whatever I want instead of waiting for you.
"Or when your parents would always make sure if you're ready to go. You are. And they're the ones who aren't. 

That shit is so obnoxious. "
"Don't go to Africa. The whole continent runs on a very lenient time-table. ""I'll be there in half an hour,"" means expect them in a few hours. ""Let's do this later,"" means we might do this today, more likely tomorrow or sometime this week."
"I suffer from this but on a much more petty scale.

When my roommate and I are walking out the door, he **always** remembers that he has to fill up his nalgene. 

He then goes over to the fridge while I am sitting in the doorway or right outside and fills it up using the slowest fucking water pressure known to man. It takes about a minute and a half, but by the time he is done, I am a bottle of rage.

I never let it show, because he is my best bro and I am crazy, but boy does it fucking make me boil."
"I'm definitely that person, it's never intentional it just seems to happen. I'm also the same person that goes to the store for milk and comes back with a new fishing pole. I should probably get tested for ADD. Although being an ""ooooh shinyyyyyy"" person is amusing at times I guess I never realized how much it pissed people off :-/ "
"I'm always ~50 minutes ""late"" because when my friends have this problem where they schedule things and they don't show up until like thirty minutes later. 

My friend invited a bunch of people to his house, I went over and he wasn't there. He went to the store to get Cheetos."
"I have a friend like that. When we all get together with some other friends we make sure to tell her to be there 1 hour earlier, so she's 10 minutes late at most. And she always uses the same lame excuse ""I called the cab but it never arrived so I had to take the bus!"""
"I have a friend who does this ALL THE GOD DAMNED TIME. It's infuriating. He is eternally late. 

Eventually we all just decided that he runs on ""nigga time"", and then it became something to laugh at, so we stopped getting so mad. "
I know some people like this.  There is a special place in hell for them.  Hopefully far away from my special place in hell for making tasteless jokes at every opportunity I get.  
This is probably #1 for me. I leave at the same time every morning and I have for a year now... I still have to remind my dad every morning and it still takes him up to 10 minutes to get out the door. WTF! Some people are complete idiots about punctuality.
"I never give out an exact time for my friends, because I know beforehand it will be later than I said it would be, because stuff happens I couldn't foresee before.

like my father needing another explanation on how to save a document or something, or my grandma asking me to fix her TV or my mother asking me to help her with the dogs quickly.

that is all time, and it adds up. I didn't like it either, but at least I know how to be flexible with time now.

however if it is something important I'll be there 10-15minutes before."
"I'm no scientist but I think it's reactions like that that keep people lying to you. 

Source: I'm one of those people."
I think it is one of those things where they don't want to disappoint you by saying 50 min when you are ready now. Then ask for forgiveness.
"I've very quickly labeled a few friends with this problem and my solution has been simple.  I no longer ask them when/where we are meeting.

I simply say ""I will be at this place at this time, feel free to come on by"".  If they show up, great, if not, great.  "
"Unfirtunately, I am guilty of doing this.

It's just I like taking my time at the expense of others. I'm a horrible person."
"OR, and this always drives me nuts, the people in lecture who make ""oh, uh huh, interesting"" comments as if they are having a private conversation with the professor instead of listening to a lecture with 300 other people. I had a woman in one of my classes who did this, and it was so distracting, I could barely take in what the professor was saying. "
The worst part is that they never know how to whisper. Like fuck I don't mind if they keep it down but they're just having a full discussion. 
"There's a guy on my course who sits right at the front and plays games on his phone all through the lecture. It's not even really that distracting it just makes me mad that he's showing up for no reason.

He even failed his first year and had to resit it, he's originally from the year above us. It's like he has no idea how learning works."
Omfg this puts me in a rage. A quiet, hidden rage though. I don't have the balls to call them out in class to shut them up :(
People who bitch about the class the whole lecture are the worst. Just fucking go home if you hate it so much. Oh its a required class? Might want to reconsider your major if you hate the class so much you can't shut your hole for an hour. I am paying assloads to do this shit and it just so happens I am actually interested in most of my classes. The ones I'm not, I can still fucking shut up about until the end of lecture.
in classes where other students are presenting, people talking has prompted me to literally yell at a room full of people to shut the fuck up.
Similarly, holy fuck the entire office has been called together for an unscheduled meeting? Yeah, let's tell spend the meeting trying to tell Sparta-moose where we went on Saturday.
There's a few people in one of my classes that will have conversations during the lecture and they don't even try to be hush about it, they use their normal conversation volume.... Rage inducing 
In lecture right now. I can't focus on the professor (even though I like the subject, and so now I'm on Reddit) because the entire fucking softball team is 2 rows behind me talking wantonly. We pay so much money for this class. Shut your whore mouths.
"I had some dumb shits sniggering about the ""front and back regions"" of Erving Goffman's Dramaturgical analysis sitting behind me. I wanted to turn around and slamdunk their heads. Stop acting like a fucking 14 year old!"
"I hate that. Like, what could they be thinking? ""Oh we're going to a big room where we shouldn't be talking and even more we should be listening to someone else speak to us? Yeah, I'd love to tell you about my weekend."""
It's seriously aggravating! I mean it's not like I payed for my education and actually want to learn anything, right?
"Holy shit, I met these two girls in my COMM 1190 class and they WILL NOT STOP BITCHING ABOUT HOW THEY HATE THE COURSE. Theyre my ""friends"" I guess and the only 2 I talk to but its annoying because the class is relevant to my major but not to theirs. UGHHH"
"Happened to my wife and I at our reception. A former friend of ours (haven't spoken to him since) let us know that he was going to do it, and then spent the next couple hours hounding us about what was going to happen ""next"" so he could find the right time or whatever. He finally works up the nerve, she asks him to step outside, and they left a few minutes later.

Come to find out she turned him down at first - she's a super shy girl, and he was too dense to figure out that proposing to her in front of all of our friends was just going to make her uncomfortable. He apparently tried again later that night when they were alone, and she agreed.

Guys (and gals), a little advice - if you're ready to take the next step in your relationship, make sure you know your SO well enough to not make them uncomfortable when you do. Oh, yeah...and don't do it at someone else's wedding reception. "
Yeah, you don't upstage the bride and groom on their wedding day. It's their day. Do your romance another time.
My son did that at his sister's wedding.  I never told him what a jerk he was because it wouldn't have done any good.
This whole public proposal idea is such a horrible idea perpetuated by cheesy romance movies. Propose in private! Then, when there is a ring where there once wasn't, it will usually become very public. 
"My cousin announced her pregnancy at my grandfather's wake. Not her grandfather, so I guess she thought that meant it was okay. 

it was not okay."
This happened to me. It was my scumbag brother in law proposing to his 17 year old girlfriend. Such a dick move.
"My buddy's sister announced she was pregnant at his wedding reception. She had known for weeks but decided to wait until his big day to announce it. She's one of the biggest attention whores that I know. 

The sad thing is that she ended up losing the baby. But, two years later when she was pregnant again, she made another announcement only for my buddy to announce his wife was pregnant as well later that day. Turnabout's fair play and all that."
I haven't experienced this either but it pisses me off too. Its just one of things that you just do NOT fucking do and I can't believe anyone would ever think it's even remotely appropriate to *steal* a monumental occasion like a wedding from someone else. Especially when the people you're upstaging are PAYING for the event. 
I didn't even know people did this. If someone pulled this at mine I'd kick them out while he's down on his knee! The nerve...
"my long term boyfriend gave a really great best man's speech this summer. At one point he made a joke about how long they had been together (17 years). He and I have been together 12, several people said ""oh my god, I thought he was going to propose right there"". I didn't know how to accurately express how fucking classless that would have been without offending people for asking. For the record, he would never ever propose at someone else's wedding, ever! "
I proposed the same weekend as my friend's wedding but I did it respectively.  Was out of town in Chicago, my SO and I went out on the town alone the night before the wedding.  I proposed that evening away from everyone else and we didn't tell anyone out of respect.  It's their day/weekend and we didn't want to ruin the spot light for them.
Listen, wedding are expensive. I'm currently organizing one with my fiancé. We're pretty broke bit you can plan for extravagance without breaking the bank. Just be sure you both are ready. 
"Yeah, this fucking happens. 

At a wedding of our good friends, another one of our good friends (who is now married to She Who Shall Not Be Named) announced his engagement to her at the reception. The bride and groom were both furious. 

He's oblivious (which is why he's with her) but lovable, she's a foreigner who played him for a green card and wants a lapdog for a husband. "
"Not exactly the same, but similar.  A day or two before my wedding I hear from my Fiance that her brother and his wife just found out they are having another baby.  Good for them!

I guess they were trying to think of a good time to announce it (when all their friends and family were together) and in their selfish ignorance, decided our wedding would be the ideal venue!  Knowing their self-obsessed nature I shouldn't have been surprised, but i'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed off (even had a groomsmen offer to go tell them to STFU, but we declined)."
I've come to the conclusion that whenever I propose or plan my wedding date, it will not be on any notable day. Not Christmas, New Years, Valentine's, Birthdays, Weddings, Anniversaries or anything else significant. To me the proposal or anniversary should stand alone as a memory in and of itself. Not associated with any other thing, which would make it more special.
"My stepfather emailed me and my sister to tell us that he was planning to propose to my mother during my wedding reception. She was able to talk him into proposing a couple of weeks sooner ""so that they'd be an official couple at the wedding"" - best sister ever!"
"You know, I know why people would find this terrible, I wouldn't do it myself for that reason. Like, I see why it could be seen as obnoxious.

HOWEVER, if it were to happen at *my* reception, I wouldn't have a problem with it. It would be kind of cool to me I think to have a few of my friends share an important day with me in a sense.

Of course my SO's opinion on the matter would end up over ruling mine on that sort of thing."
I recently saw this in an episode of The Mentalist. Everyone was standing around cheering while I was thinking who the fuck does that at a wedding and why aren't the bride and groom pissed?
Similarly, if someone where's white at the wedding (who is not the bride) without the bride's permission.  Fucking magicians......
Public proposals are an exercise in narcissistic manipulation anyway.  You know she'll know people are watching and not want to embarrass you both by saying no, even if she wants to.  Don't be that guy.
"> I have a very serious bf, and we both know we're going to get married.

You sound pretty serious too."
">We just don't want to get engaged until we can afford to set the date.

You know whenever there's a thread about 'what do you think is the biggest waste of money', big elaborate and expensive weddings always place really high. I mean if you really want a big wedding more power to you, I've been to one and it was fun. You might want to consider going small though. You'll still be married either way.

Not trying to tell you how to live your life, just saying"
just ask the bride and groom first. it's the nice thing to do and if you know them well enough they won't get all crazy about it
"I honestly never understand why this is a problem. If it's done near the end of the day and not right after the 
wedding then eh, good thinking, it's a tactical proposal "
"I never understood this. Why should someone finding their own happiness at a celebration of your happiness be a bad thing? If someone proposed to their girlfriend at my wedding I'd be happy for them, especially if it was one of my friends. Why can't we all just share the love? 

It's like you people think a wedding is some kind of competition for attention or something. Why do words like ""upstaged"" even apply, it's not a theatre production. Just because you're getting married doesn't make you the center of the universe, Jeez."
Or to comment on somebody else's appearance at all. If I don't wear makeup one day, somebody is going to tell me that I should sleep more. Thanks,  these bags are genetic. 
"My mom used to love to do this.  ""Oh look, you're getting this giant zit on your chin!""

Thanks, Mom.  Cuz until you told me, *I had no idea.*"
"I have suffered severe acne, and people would approach me, not even trying to insult me or make me feel bad and say something like ""wow, you have really bad acne"", it stupefies me every time.

I then take a few minutes to explain just how stupid they are for doing that, and make them feel bad about it so they never do it to anyone again. "
My aunt and mother in law have done this multiple times it makes me fucking rage. Oh, are you not aware I own a mirror and have to look at my stupid acne face everyday? Go fuck yourself.
"A child once asked me, ""Why do you have red dots all over your face?"" I have never wanted to drop kick a child until that moment."
"Probably 10+ years ago in high school I ran into a friend at a diner. He had a big red bump on his face and I just blurted out ""oh god! What happened to your face?"" He just sheepishly replied ""It's a zit."" I've felt bad about that for years!"
"Kids in middle school would draw portraits of me and exaggerate my acne in them. Like those caricature artists.

Now, a senior in high school, my acne is finally cleared thanks to accutane, but fuck those kids still."
"Was in sixth grade and this cunt Erica fucking big nosed French turns around in line to where I am quietly standing and says ""sorry, but you have acne."" THANKS BITCH like you stemmed fucking years of fucking low self esteem because after that day I KNEW people could see it too. That fucking bitch. I finally got my skin clear last year and can't handle leaving the house without makeup still and FUCK THAT BITCH SO HARD FUCKING BITCH CUNT BITCH TWAT. "
"ha. A girl at a party once tried to pick me up, and actually thought ""OH MY GOD IS THAT CANCER ON YOUR FACE?!"" was a good icebreaker. 

for the record, it's not a tumor."
Yeah that used  to make me so mad. I had bad acne in middle/high school and I saw a dermatologist and was taking prescription meds for it. When people would say, you have a pimple or whatever it would infuriate me, its like, what else can I do? I'm sorry I wasn't blessed with good skin when I was born.
"On the same note, people who point out that you have an injury. I was playing baseball and fell down, cutting my whole leg open. I was walking home to clean it up, and this random guy comes up and says ""ohmygod you're bleeeeding!"" No. No I don't need your fucking bandage. You can piss right off. I know I'm fucking bleeding. Dick."
This was my greatest fear in middle school and I'm sure it contributes to the anxiety I have over a decade later.
"Ding ding, we have a winrar. My 12 year old cousin is the most spoiled brat that I know. She is treated like a godess among mortals by my grandma. I cannot stand her and she is just so rude and annoying. Like when I was about 14, I started getting some peach fuzz on my upper lip. What is the first thing she said when we got to her house for Thanksgiving that year? ""Hehe! Rsurect_ has a mustache"" and continuously reached for my upper lip the whole night. My grandma thought it was a hoot and my parents did nothing to help my embarrassment. I started getting a pretty bad acne outbreak last year on my back and it was pretty awful looking, in my eyes at least. Well she went with us to the local waterpark. The first thing she says when I took off my shirt was, ""Hehe that is so weird! You have zits on your back?! Gross!!"". Fuck you too bitch."
I'm okay with them pointing out a huge flake of skin dangling off my face, but a zit? I really didn't notice that, Sherlock. I don't even look in the mirror in the morning.
"Honestly though. The one for me is that I sometimes get bad eye allergies and my eyes get kind of red puffy and itchy. Honestly I don't mind the symptoms too terribly but I hate the knowledge that at least a million people will come up to me today and be like , ""whoa what's wrong with your eyes?"" And I have to say, ""oh I have allergies..."" Which ends up sounding like some weak excuse."
"I have a nice little bacterial infection (cellulitis) below my eye. Been there for about 3 weeks and been on 3 different anti biotics. Currently penecilin. It will not fucking go away. And I hear everyday at school, ""nice std on your face"", ""do you have herpes?"" Its like thats not even fucking funny, asshole! Im aware of it!"
"What about if, for example, girls I know have a rouge eye lash or spec of makeup on their face? I usually tell them about it or if I know them well enough, say ""hold on a sec"" and grab it. I've never been shunned, but I've never asked if this was actually okay or not."
"Seriously don't get why people do this. 
""Hey what's up, man. Oh woah you got a huge pimple on your forehead. Like, right in the middle.""
""YEAHMANITOTALLYDIDNTSEEITINTHEMIRRORTHISMORNINGHOLYSHITTHANKYOU!"""
I tell friends if they have a pimple that looks like it needs to be popped, I thought I was helping. Am I just an asshole? :(
"Typically it's absolute sheer laziness too. Hazards are not ""park anywhere"" lights. I've seen people double parked when there is a parallel space big enough for any car 100 feet down the road. I will honestly park almost anywhere to avoid doing this to people. On the rare instance that I double park, I stay in the car and if someone comes up behind me, I make a lap around the block as to not inconvenience them. "
 It all depends on what they're about. My standards towards myself are much much higher than I would expect from someone else. It's still double standards but, it's not necessarily bad.
"My mom is going to group therapy and was telling one of my aunts all about it. ""Oh you know, *ignoring someone is violence*, that's what we learnt today. It was eye-opening"".

So later in the day she got angry at me and ignored me for hours."
My personal favorite is when someone spends 4 hours on Netflix and it's okay, but playing 2 hours of videogames means you are fat and have no life.
"All hypocrisy must be wiped out.  I don't care how irrational I sound.  Hypocrites should be sought out and ... Well something awful that I shouldn't propose online.  

It's always in their favor.  I want to smack them over the head with a John Rawls book.  Most of them are in Congress."
"I had a boyfriend who did this. He was extremely emotionally manipulative and a severe alcoholic (I was young a dumb and thought I was in love). He would call me at 3 in the morning, drunk as fuck, and tell me how I was way too good for him and that he was leaving me because he was a nobody who could never live up to my standards and how I should just never speak to him again. I should have just said ""okay"" and hung up, but instead I got trapped in that web of manipulation and would go find him drunk at the bar and take him home. God I was stupid."
My mother is like this. She always wants attention, tries to make me feel guilty for her problems, and gets upset with me when I can't spend all day on the phone with her. I no longer feel guilty for things that are out of my control. I don't let her guilt me into talking all day. I have a 10 month old and I simply don't have the time.
I hate this! I had a friend that was like this. One day she wore a new shirt when I walked up to her she pushed her chest out and stared me right in the eyes waiting for me to compliment her on it. I just stared back and walked past, I'm not giving you a compliment because you think you deserve it. Bitch.
"ugh and people who you get into a fight with, and you very clearly tell them what they are doing wrong and why it is upsetting you, and they get all pissed off and defensive.

And then the next day:

""Hey dude, whats up, want to hang out?""

NO MAN, I AM MAD AT YOU"
"I see your point, but there's the other side to it. I'm typically a normal guy, almost no issues with anybody ever. They might annoy the fuck out of me, but I'm still patient with them. But I can't get it out of my head sometimes that I'm legitimately a bad person. I had a breakdown about 11 am today, and the reverse happened. Rather than paying attention to the guy who appears to be sobbing in the corner, all but 2 of my friends payed 0 attention to me. That fed my brain the fact that almost no one liked me, ergo, bad friend. I got over it about 3 pm, but I couldn't hold myself together during those 4 hours. There are times when you really should pay attention to that person.

tl,dr: had a mental breakdown, friends thought I was attention whoring. Sometimes they really do need a good bro."
The worst case is when you notice it after your jacket and trousers are wet. It sure makes me mad only to see a wet seat but yeah..
"As someone who did this in the past I tell you that I wouldn't have if I had anywhere else to go...

About 4 years ago I was in town, and had to go really bad... There was no place to go to... Walked in a store and asked the lady if I could use her bathroom... She said no...

Me: LADY! IF YOU DON'T LET ME USE THE BATHROOM, I'M PISSING RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORE!"
"Fun fact: most urine found on toilet seats in your home is the fault of the *women* of the household.

""Surely not!"" you ladies say. But, how many times have you had to tell your menfolk to put the seat down after they've gone to the toilet? **We piss with the seat up, we can't possibly be responsible for urine on it.**"
"I can understand this if it's a kid just getting out of diapers and has poor aim/control.  

But if you're a grown man and you can't manage to point your pecker correctly you need to sit down and piss like the woman you are."
"That moment when you're at the gym, good music flowing, you're in the zone and bam! Cord gets caught and the ear buds are violently ripped from your ears. I let out a small rant of obscenities everytime. 

edit: grammar "
"No, what's worse is when somebody decides that they must start a conversation with you that exact second, and pull your headphones out your ears so they can talk to you.

An old roommate did that to me, and then pretty much flat out accused me of stealing his stuff from the fridge, despite having no evidence that I had (I hadn't btw), I told him what a dick he was being and to basically go fuck himself."
I am sure this exact answer was at the top of this thread last time this question was asked. It's almost like secret cabals of redditors are getting together and copying and pasting askreddit threads/answers as some kind of sinister karma generating machine.
I've ruined at least 4 good pairs of over the ear headphones because instead of simply having you glorious vibrations ripped from your hearing receptacle, it instead catches on your neck and snaps the cord. 
This, a thousand times this. Get done with a set, adding weight to the bar, and my cable gets caught and I flip my shit. 
Does anybody have a (real) explanation for why they put the little call-button-box thing directly at collar-level? This is what always does it to me.
"It's really bizarre just how *fucking angry* that makes me.  The reaction is so instantaneous and intense.  It goes away almost as quickly as it arrives, but it takes some degree of self-control to remind myself that this really doesn't matter, chill out dude.

but in that initial split second, white hot *rage*."
I feel like I'm the only person on reddit who is just gets mildly annoyed for the two seconds it takes for me to put ear bud back in. 
"I came here to say exactly this or vice versa
The headphone wire gets caught on something and rips out of the phone. Instant annoyance. "
I always thought I was over reacting.  Fucking treadmill handles.  About kicked that treadmills ass last night.
"Running the cord under your shirt will help prevent this.  
For those annoying behind-the-ear uneven-y-cord type headphones, if you run it through the rear belt loop first it'll always be behind your back in the right spot."
"So. Much. Rage. 

I come close to just breaking them if they do that. I usually wear the ice the ear headphones so when the cord snags it yanks my entire head. 

"
I honestly think it's worse when someone purposely does it. Could be an 80 year old woman and you still want to smack her like a ho that owes you money.
What worse is when you take your headphones out of your ears because someone wants to talk to you....infuriating!
Similar experience....nothing makes my blood boil quicker than having my ear protectors knocked off by a branch while mowing the lawn.
Even worse when someone is trying to talk to you but you can't hear them so they pull them out. I've never been angrier in my life. I'm usually not a violent person, but when my cousin did this to me I gut punched the fuck out of him.
I have a freak out every single time that happens to me. Goddammit. Just thinking about it happening makes me furious.
As a tall male, this annoys the shit out of me. My belt loops get caught on door handles, my headphones get caught on just about everything. My e-brake while getting out of the car is one of the worsts
I use canalphones (they go *in* the ear like earplugs).  Great isolation, but I'm always concerned that they'll get forced out and cause a lot of pain and hearing damage, so I never use them while physically active.
Worse is when someone else sees you're using earphones and has to tell you something. Only, this thing is so important that they can't just catch your eye and gesture for you to take them out, or tap you on the shoulder. No; they walk up to you and yank the buds out of your ears / unplug the jack from the laptop/TV/ipod.
Or when people pull it out AFTER you pause your music because they think you're not listening. God, it's not painful but my God does it infuriate me.
"My method for preventing this:
1)run headphone cord out of pocket and straight through belt loops across towards your other pocket. 
2)continue up through your shirt and in your ears. 
3) keep slack tucked in waistline or inside shirt
4) ??
5) profit"
Almost as bad is scooting to get up and generating static electricity that zaps the inside of your ears.  
When someone else pulls your ear buds out of your ears. I put my 'what the fuck' face on immediately.
Wireless headphones are a boon, I got a pair a couple months ago and they're awesome. best part: they don't get tangled in your pocket
"Really? Rage inducing? You have shit like child abuse and human trafficking and having to put your head phone back in induces rage?

If that really makes you mad you need to relax a bit. "
Especially at 7:30am. I'm trying to get to work, you slow bastard, I'm not up at this time for the fun of it, stop driving at 40mph the whole way whether the speed limit is 60, 50 or 30.
How about someone going slow on an on-ramp to a freeway. Oh my god I just want to have psychic powers to toss their car out of the way. Its an on-ramp man, you're supposed to get on it!
Then going to pass them in the slow lane just to have them speed up along with you. Sometimes I just want to run those people off the road. 
I always try to give drivers the benefit of a doubt for my own sanity. People driving slow could be lost and looking out for street signs, their gas tank could be on E and they're coasting to a gas station, or they could be having a medical episode. But when those slow drivers are in the left lane on a major road, RAWRRRGHJKJG
"My drive to work every morning:

""The speed limit went from 60 to 70? That can't be right. I'd better slow down in case it's a trick.""


...is what I imagine every motorist in front of me thinking."
This is the worst when you're on the highway. The speed limit here in Canada is 100 kms/h yet I constantly see people driving 70-80 kms in the center lane when there is no traffic. If you don't like driving fast then stay off the damn highway or at least stay in the right hand lane. 
"Oh man, the other day my dad was telling me how ""ruthless"" and ""crazy"" drivers are these days and how they're always passing you and cutting you off. I had to tell him, no, they're not crazy, you just for some crazy reason always drive 10mph slower than the speed limit. Even as a passenger I go nuts, and constantly tell him to speed up.

He can't seem to grasp that fact that driving slower is actually just as illegal as speeding, since he thinks it is ""safer"". "
"This. And related to this, people who drive like they're terrified of driving. 

You can turn. The car that's coming is like a mile away, and guess what, *he has brakes,* he can slow down if he has to. He doesn't want to smash into you just as much as you don't want to crash into him. "
"Or when everyone is doing ten under the limit while driving behind a cop. 

Every time this happens I pass everyone and then wave to the cop while doing the speed limit. Everyone else usually follows me after they notice I didn't get pulled over for it. "
"> Being stuck behind someone driving slow for no reason.

In the left lane.  

--OR--

Someone ""blocking"" me in.  

IDGAF what the speed limit is.  Honestly.  I don't fucking care.  I'm the one who suffers if I feel like doing 10 over on an empty road and get a ticket.

Stop trying to dictate how fast I go.  That's **my** business.  Not for you to decide.  

If there is someone on your bumper, move over.  I don't care how fast you are going.  Move over. 

Makes my blood boil.  "
And on top of that driving in broad daylight, slow as shit, with your hazards flashing, no traffic, nothing wrong with your car. Umm? Maybe it's time to hang up the keys since your're advertising that you are a HAZARD to other drivers.
Ughhhh I drove from 9am to 3pm and hit the speed limit *maybe* twice. In 6 hours of driving, the whole time I was behind a bunch of different people who didn't want to go even remotely close to the limit. I've been crazy mad all day. It's ridiculous. I'm glad I'm the only one in my state that has somewhere to be/something to do in the middle of the week. 
I sometimes unintentionally drive slow when I'm eating. Any other time I'm going at least 5 over though.
Old man is driving 20 km/h on a city street where the limit is 50 km/h, no other traffic in front of or behind him. BESIDES ME. Can't pass him because cars are parked on both sides of the road(side street), and when I do finally pass him he honks at me and flips me off.
On the other hand, driving in front of someone who was speeding and now tailgating you. Don't risk everyone else's lives because you weren't being responsible enough to wake up on time. 
I'm not that slow driver, but I have another perspective. I was ticketed and I can't get another ticket for 18 months or I'll get a point on my license. So, I drive no faster than the speed limit. As a result, I get passed frequently by horn-honking, bird-flipping dickheads who think I'm inconveniencing them with my slower speed. (Not saying you do this. This is just my opportunity to vent.) I always stay away from the fast lanes, and I never drive at an unsafe speed, but I still get jerks angry at me because I'm not driving at the speed of fucking light. Fuck me for not wanting points on my license, right? 
I tend to drive really slow just to piss off assholes behind me.  By this I mean, I start off driving fine, usually above the speed limit.  Then someone more important than me deems my 5-10 mph speeding is too damn slow for them, they honk, tailgate or blow their horn at me.  I immediately slow down to 5-10 mph below the speed limit.
"how slow do we speak here?

I often drive 80km/h when I could drive 100km/h because I just feel like it and tell myself, ""the drivers behind me can pass me anytime they feel like it, I'm not stopping them, but I will not drive faster for them either""

Also I check my rear-view mirror frantically often (it's become a reflex now), and whenever someone tries to pass me, I slow down for them a bit and drive more to the right, so that they can pass faster with a bigger room for error (that is the least I can do for you guys)).

What really irks me are people who do not know the concept of safety-distance, I mean keeping it can literally improve your take-over, which is just one of the benefits."
"Uh you might have been stuck behind me. I have ADD and my mind starts to wander sometimes. If I'm driving I reflexively ease off the gas when this happens.

Also there's times I'm trying to adjust music but that's not as good of a reason."
"Okay that argument sounds stupid as hell, but I don't know why. 

I am genuinely curious, why are there both humans and monkeys? I know they are fairly closely related but I can only assume that it's sort of like how if you had a child and your cousin had a child, and then you jumped 1000 years into the future, their great-times-whatever children would have vastly different family trees from each other. "
"Ugh my friend just told me he doesn't believe I'm evolution and it ruined my day. He said:

-There isn't evidence for evolution 

-""sometimes a finch is just a finch"" not really sure why he meant by that, but I love how he used one of the most famous examples of evolution (Darwin's finches) as an argument *against* evolution

-he believes in adaptation but not evolution.. WHAT

-""we didn't come from monkeys""

Even though he claims to have done research on the subject (from a biased source most likely), he couldn't even tell me the different between macro evolution and micro evolution. 

Faith is one thing, but I think denying fact is some ignorant ass bullshit.


"
"Explaining this, and any other crazy scenarios, will do nothing to deter them. It really just exemplifies how little they know about science.

I've had to clarify some conversations by explaining that evolution doesn't prove or disprove any deity.  I am amazed at the number of people that seem to think Darwin was using his research to directly disprove their god."
This is something my dad says. Like direct quote. I want to kind of explain to him that he's wrong so he can see things clearly but he's extremely hard headed and would just angrily shut me down. I also just don't really know that much about evolution and haven't studied it that much. What would be a good, evidence-based, intelligent response to his statement that would disprove him? 
"A lot of these responses are worded in such a way that it seems like they don't understand how evolution works either.

A. We didn't descend from modern day monkeys or apes or modern day anything. 

B. we descended from a recent common ancestor with modern day apes. It's like a family tree ONLY MUCH FUCKING BIGGER.

C. This is why a joke like, ""if Americans come from Europeans why are there still French people?"" doesn't work."
If they are that dumb, don't bother trying to explain. Won't help. Just accept that there are many people who will never understand a lot of things.
In addition to this, people who argue that it's only a theory. Does ANYONE understand what a scientific theory is? It's not some notion people dream up out of the blue and all of a sudden everyone just accepts it. 
It's like, that's not even what evolution says.  Monkey and people came from the same thing.  That thing isn't walking around anymore.
This sort of thing really makes me sad. They honestly believe that- and it's a logical assumption if you know nothing about evolution... Sure, it's bad when people who say ignorant statements don't want to be corrected, but if your parents and teachers and preachers have all been telling you one thing, why would you listen to some guy off the street claiming to know more about the way the world works than everyone else in your life?
I'm an automation engineer who does a lot of commissioning jobs around the country. So I work with a lot of electricians, mechanics, line men.....etc. They always love to shoot the shit. I've been working in western Texas where there are a lot of people that would be the perfect stereo type of an american....fatter, hairier, drive pickups, and mostly eat meat. There were some electricians shooting the shit as they were installing conduit when they started talking about evolution. One of the guy starts spouting out about how he thinks its stupid they teach evolution in schools because he hasn't seen evolution happen FIRST HAND. For example, (and this was his own) he hasn't seen a monkey walking around, turn into a human right there on the spot....the part that made my jaw drop even further was his buddy was agreeing with him...this was followed by a conversation about Obama being president is stupid because it'd be like him going to Sweden and declaring himself president....
"people who won't let their kids play pokemon because pokemon ""evolve"". They need to fucking learn bio before they become a dick to their kid"
"We share a common ancestor. We didnt evolve from apes and they didnt evolve from us. Each species branched from one species which explains the similarities between humans and apes.

If someone already explained this, i apologize for the redundancy, but a lot of these answers are too long and i dont wanna read them.

Edit: read OPs comment wrong. Im leaving this anyway."
I just had a conversation with one of these people, he tried to tell me that the earth is only 10,000 years old and that people lived with dinosaurs. And the to top it off he said that Ken Hamm was a reputable scientist. I almost fainted. Then I brought up the fact that with carbon dating we can pinpoint that exact age of the earth, and then he preceded to tell me carbon dating isnt reliable science compared to the bible. 
"Bracing for downvotes, but I get pretty mad at people who get pretty mad at people they perceive to be ignorant. Unless you think that their misconception about a very abstract concept might pose some practical threat to their lives, why not just let them have their own beliefs? It might go against observation or even rationalism, but whatever.

If I was choosy about my friends, I would *far* prefer to have a slightly ditzy but ultimately happy fundamentalist as a friend, than an irritable athiest. (Provided that the fundamentalist wasn't just as aggressively evangelical about her views as most neckbearded athiests seem to be...)"
HAHAHAHAHA look at this dumb fuck asking questions! Lets get angry instead of using the time to teach someone about evolution.
Let's not propagate the lie that for every unwanted child there's an eager couple waiting to snap them up into a loving home. Foster homes are usually a better choice, but those are a gamble as well.
"> Why the fuck do have kids if you don't want to love them? 

Because sexual education in America is a complete joke, there's an embarrassing stigma against buying condoms, and birth control is often prohibitively expensive unless you have good insurance or qualify for medicaid(which you don't unless you're- you guessed it- pregnant!). The religious right is working tirelessly to restrict access to contraception and they're succeeding in many places. Plan B is not available everywhere & even where it is, it costs $50 & you have to ask for it & take a chance on possibly getting a religious phamacist who invokes his ""right of conscience"" and refuses to dispense it. In lots of states abortion is either restricted to the point of unavailability or else not an option unless you can afford to pull $500+ out of your ass.

Adoption isn't a magic solution either. In America, the vast majority of adoptive parents want healthy, white infants. The majority of children in orphanages are NOT healthy, white infants. Hundreds of thousands of kids are ""lifers"", living in group homes & orphanages till they're legal adults because they're unadoptable for one reason or another- wrong race, too old, emotional problems, special needs, etc. If I wanted a child I'd happily adopt whichever child needed me the most but a lot of people are very picky. They want people to think they had the child themselves, and they're not gonna adopt an 8 year old of a different race with fetal alcohol syndrome and emotional problems from past abuse. 

Most people who have abused/neglected kids didn't have them under the mindset of ""I'm going to have this kid and treat it like shit!"". More like ""FML, I'm pregnant & my life is over."" They have the kid cause they can't afford to terminate the pregnancy, struggle, hate their lives, and take it out on the kid. Its not right & I'm in no way defending those parents, but that's usually how it happens.

Don't take this to be me attacking you. I'm not in any way. I'm just stating the sad truth about unwanted kids in this country. Things need to change here. "
A lot of abusive parents didn't want kids but due to religion couldn't get an abortion. Thanks, Jesus.
When I asked my mom why she had me, she said it was because she wanted a genetic copy of herself. People don't always have kids because they love kids. Sometimes they have them for stupid or backwards reasons, or because someone/something pressured them in to it.
"The reason some of those people had children, was because they simply didn't think about what raising a child would truly entail.

They liked being pregnant. They liked the baby showers. They liked the attention it gave them and the excitement everyone built up around them as though it was some monumental occasion. MAYBE they even enjoyed the early stages of dressing up and showing off the baby, again for attention.

What they didn't take into account, was how people stop giving a shit about your not-special baby and life carried on. The baby only shits and pukes for a good long while, before you get your first smile or recognition on their face that you're anything other than a blurry blob.

They begin to resent the baby because it represents the loss of time, young firm body, and closeness with their partner. The child is CONSTANTLY wanting your attention and doesn't simply ""go away"", when you want it to. It screams and screams and screams. Maybe the baby is sad, maybe it is hunger, or maybe it is lonely and wants a cuddle. You just don't care anymore because you now hate that baby and what it has done to you and your life.

The trouble is, you can't break up or be passive-aggressive with your baby. Even most abusers are incapable of abandoning their baby, because they still care about what people might think. Ever hear someone who did the most awful things to their children, and yet they still have the balls to say, ""I'm a good parent. They have a roof over their head...""

It's the mentality of a child. Blame others for your mistakes/choices, hold on to the most minuscule aspect as the positive, and take out your frustrations on those weaker than you."
"My cousin had a baby so people would pay attention to her, i shit you not. she spent a few grand on a pure bred pitbull ""on a whim"" and promptly gave it away once people stopped caring. she recently had another newbourne because she had her first one taken away by CPS. its now with her mothers custody. anyways she was doing drugs at the time and the baby was born addicted and nearly died. this shit just pisses me off to un believable proportions.

she wonders why i hate her very existence, and causes trouble whenever the family gets together. "
I have two of the most ignorant, idiotic people that live in my apt complex, they are basically Scumbag Steve & Stacy. I just saw them the other day at the grocery store pushing their newborn baby. My first thought was sympathy for that poor baby who has these two morons for parents. 
But that isn't true, there isn't a Home for unwanted kids. That's why there are so many orphanages and such
"DCF takes forever to become involved in anything unless the parent in question is already in the system.

Then they overreact at smaller things the system parent does and ignore first time reported offenders."
Or who leave their blinkers on. I sometimes slow down to let them in but they just stay in the same lane. CAN YOU NOT HEAR THE TICKING OF YOUR BLINKER?
"My sister is one of those people. I absolutely hate being in the car with her. ""I am a good driver so I don't need to use turn signals."" Oh okay. I wasn't aware that just bad drivers had to use turn signals. "
"Oh man, I've been casually seeing a guy who does this. I feel the anger creeping in every time I'm in the car with him. I actually think it's becoming a mental roadblock (har har) that's keeping me from developing any serious feelings for him. 

Is there a nice way to tell someone driving a car that you're a passenger in to use their blinkers? I'm still in the new phase of dating this guy and don't want to ruin it by criticizing him, but I mean...COME ON.

"
You may catch me speeding, I may roll a stop sign. But you will **never** catch me turning/switching lanes w/o using my blinker. 
"Hell yes. Every time I see a car change lanes or approach a turn where a signal is required and it's not used, I think ""Must be another ignorant idiot at the wheel."" I wonder what these people think the turn signal is meant for. Giving people behind you a light show? lol"
There was a car I seen the other day that did use his blinker except did it wrong. The guy was in the left lane had his right blinker on then merged ledt then had his left blinker on and merged right he was passing a car but it was confusing to all the drivers on the road
My parents spend the winter in Florida and while visiting I noticed he wasn't using his signal light, which is never something I noticed before.  Upon questioning him he told me that if you use your blinker, people will expressely try and cut you off so you cant change lanes.  Florida drivers were nuts.
"I never use my blinkers, and infact with good reason, most people here in orange county will not let you over if you use your blinker they will accelerate to block you.. and the people who do use their blinkers never turn them off so they just drive straight while blinking haha.
"
I don't use mine sometimes even I'm in a hurry... Don't get too pissed at people over this. You've probably had to shit pretty bad before, more imagine you're stuck in your car and about to let loose. You wouldn't waste time using your blinker.
"This and child abuse. 

Basically injustice of the strong over the weak. 

That and getting hit in the nuts. These things make my fist clench.

[edit] how the hell does animal cruelty drop below pulling headphones out of your ear?

Now this makes me angry too."
I don't understand how people can be so dumb. If you can't take care of an animal, don't get one. Also beating a dog is NOT a good way to train it.
Or even just people who get a pet and decide after some time they don't want it anymore. Some of my family does this and it drives me nuts. My cousin will adopt a dog, and love it for like, a year, and then give it away. Two months later - NEW DOG. WTF YOU DON'T DO THAT TO YOUR KIDS YOU STUPID BITCH WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO AN ANIMAL THAT DEPENDS ON YOU. 
"My girlfriend went to high school with a kid who was in a parking lot where a duck with a bunch of ducklings were crossing the lot. He thought it was funny to drive his truck around running over and killing each duckling. Apparently he thought it was hilarious how mad his friends were getting at him for doing it so he kept doing it. The cops were called and the kid got arrested. He was also kicked off his hockey team.

When she told me this story, I was enraged. For the next hour or so all I could think about is how much pain I wished someone would inflict on him.

I just cannot comprehend how psychotic one has to be to think that is funny in any way."
"I was in Egypt a few months ago, and while we were seeing the pyramids, there are tons of people who have horses and camels that people can ride or sit on and take pictures (for a fee, of course). 

At one point I looked over and I saw a man brutally beating his horse because it wouldn't get up off the ground fast enough. It seriously made me dizzy and nauseous. I had to look away because I knew there was nothing I could do. "
My cat used to live with an old lady who had about twenty cats and no way to take care of them. He has really bad trust issues and when we first got him he would constantly rip his fur out with his teeth (due to psychological trauma, according to the vet). Even though the lady wasn't trying to actively hurt him, it makes me furious that he and all her other cats that got taken away had to go through that. 
"My friend hits his dog when it miss behaves.  Like when we went to the beach and the dog (9months old)  pooped on the beach and ran to me about 100yrds down.  My friend came over and beat him till he was yelping.  Its not like he knew better he had never been to a beach.  


What should I do.  "
I think it's weird that animal cruelty and child abuse is lower than accidentally getting your headphones pulled out in a thread about things that make you angry.
This. Makes me sick to my stomach even just thinking about it. I think the laws need to operate under the assumption that animals are people. If you harm an animal it's assault. Just like assaulting a person. 
Definitely. I have a neighbor that leaves their dog outside all day and all night, year-round. It's a little dog, probably a Pomeranian or something, so there's no way it is suited for the cold northern-pacific weather. Cops come out and they just put the dog inside for like an hour and then back outside it goes. I know there's much worse stuff going on out there, but goddamn it why can't people just be good to their pets? If you don't want to take care of a dog, don't get a fucking dog.
"Or the idiots who don't give more than a ""aww, that's too bad"" at a child abuse article but when there's an animal abuse article they almost burst into tears.

EDIT: fuck you ios7 autocorrect"
I'm annoyed I had to scroll down so far to find this. Honestly animal abuse gets me more riled up than child abuse. No idea why. I guess I don't have kids but I have animals.
It gets me that the same people who love their pets and treat them like family eat meat without any remorse.  There's a big difference between killing and eating an animal when you need to, and mass producing animal suffering because you like the taste.  
or how about all these agencies pleading to donate to animal shelters when there are millions of starving humans in need
That's what pisses me off the most. I don't give a crap if you don't vaccinate your kid and let them get sick but, my kid would go to shcool with your kid and your kid would get everyone sick just because you're an asshole. 
Here in Australia they don't even have the decency to call themselves 'anti-vaccination'. They just call themselves the Australian Vaccination Network. These people are so obviously full of shit, and they know it.
"This movement is the equivalent of a movement that promotes child abuse. The ""scientific evidence"" behind it shakier than creation science which is pretty fucking shaky."
"What exactly do you say to people who refuse to vaccinate their children aside from calling them idiots? My cousin and her husband have bought into the ""vaccination causes autism"" bullshit spread by Jenny McCarthy. What could I say, preferably something with some scientific evidence behind it, that would convince them otherwise?"
This needs to be a lot closer to the top. I read The Panic Virus by Seth Mnookin earlier this year and raged nonstop the whole time I was reading it.
"Add to that any woo-woo magic thinking crowd.  People who believe in homeopathy, Eastern alternative medicine, ""natural"" remedies, etc.  People who want to think with their gut instead of their brains should be denied medical care"
"Coworker of mine is a very attractive woman, and I rather enjoy her presence in the office. However when she stated that she kind of doesn't ""believe"" in the flu shot for someone her age and health (marathon runner in mid-20s), I lost a lot of respect for her. Sure, she'll maybe fight off the flu, but what about the children or elderly folks she comes in contact with as the carrier?!"
They fucking rely on everyone else to give their kids shots and then claim it totally works because their children never get sick.
Yes! And, can I just add, I get particularly incensed by people who are against the HPV vaccine. Guys, we invented a vaccine!! that prevents cancer!! This is truly amazing. We have the ability to prevent a cancer that predominantly occurs in younger women. All the people who waste their money on pinkwashed garbage which does next to nothing to improve breast cancer outcomes, and then refuse their children an actual VACCINE against CERVICAL CANCER. This makes me furious and sad.
"There was a friend on Facebook who posted antivac garbage. I crushed anything she posted in a polite and informative manner. She would always end the conversation with ""well I think there needs to be more research, we don't have enough information."" Eventually she started deleting my comments. Antivac plus censorship? Fuck that noise, unfriended. "
When someone says heavy metal makes people violent as well. Does it not occur to them that aggressive people are attracted to aggressive things? 
Indeed.  If GTA influenced people's behavior, every telephone pole would have a car wrapped around it. 
"On top of that, if you're the kind of guy who plays Halo or GTA and then decides ""I'm gonna go imitate this."", You had something wrong with you in the first place. 

The other thing I hate is when people try and call stuff like CoD and Battlefield ""combat simulators"".  No.  Take any of those MLG players you want and give them a real gun.  They won't hit a target that's 15 feet in front of them."
"I really don't think that video games make people more violent. *However*, if it had any effect on violence, it would be more like ""video games making violence more acceptable"".  
Just saying it'd be more a passive repercution than an active process."
I would have thought it would be the opposite. let's give these psychopaths an outlet for their violence so they don't do it on real people
"Same with guns, people even act like I'm fucked up for not killing things (hunting) with my guns. ""I like to shoot, I would kill deer, squirrels, and other woodland creatures to sooth your fucked up viewpoint but I don't like to and am morally against it.""

""Well, I just don't see why you need so many.""

""I don't understand why you feel you need to be a cunt, I don't understand why you need so many children when you do such a shitty job of raising them but you don't see me running around berating you for your fucked up lifestyle."""
Violent video games make me less violent. Instead of punching someone in the throat, I open up GTA and blow up a dozen cars. There, I feel better now.
Oh COME ON. I'm writing a research paper on that and came to reddit to take a break, and this is the first thing I see. 
Thing that bothers me is that, before video games, and television, and comic books, and banned novels, there were HUGE wars many years ago where countless numbers of people died. The numbers ranged in the hundreds of thousands to millions. It's not video games that make people violent, it's people. 
"Eh
What
No
This doesn't end well. Because where are most of the people saying video games are violent? On tv. So if they make you violent, then TV makes you violent, and what's even more involving than TV? VIDEO GAMES

So it's like the logic of people who wind you up just to say ""look, I told you you were mad.""

Instead of anger, I just ignore these people."
"Oh my god this. The other day when there was news of someone being stabbed over a copy of GTA V my uncle came up to me, the only gamer in the house like ""See, video games are evil"" and I wanted to say ""Oh shut your stupid mouth, people get stabbed for things all the time, often the money in their wallet, less than the value of the game. The only reason this was on the news was to trick ignorant fools like you into believing the whole ""video games are evil"" thing.""

Instead I just said the ""people get stabbed for things of less value all the time."" and turned away."
"THIS.

Literally a sophomore in my Small Animal class at my High School said this today. I am a junior. I ask him if I look like a murderer or mass shooter. He says no and I tell him how I have played video games that were violent pretty much all my life and how I have killed a lot of people in GTA 5... I love that game"
"Sorry, I'm not on board with you here. Exposure to violent media is pretty well known to be a risk factor in predicting violent behavior. This doesn't mean ""violent video games are responsible for shootings"". It means there *is* a correlation.

Start with reading about the Bobo doll experiment, and go from there. The common saying in psychology circles today is ""the notion that exposure to violent media is associated with violent behavior is about as strong as the notion that smoking is associated with lung cancer.""

It affects children differently than adults, but it affects us all. And it doesn't seem like a stretch to see that showing a child ten thousand depictions of violent, bloody murder all day long, is *not good for that child's mental and emotional well-being*.

EDIT: To all the downvoters: do a little research at the *actual studies.* Do some google scholar reading. There is a very significant correlation, no matter how much you don't want there to be. *Exposure to violent media increases the risk of aggressive behavior*. It just does. Sorry!"
Yeah but tell some of those people that defend video games that guns also don't kill any one or illicit violence in people and restricting guns will not solve the problem at all and they flip their shit.
It's even worse when you ask friendly if you could pass and they give you this look as if you murdered their first born child AND THEY FUCKING CONTINUE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ISLE! Haven't you learned, you isle-space-taking fartwaffle?!
"I don't want to be that guy, but in this case, it's aisle.  Isle for an island, aisle for a grocery store.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be in the shower washing off the stink of being the guy who corrected someone's spelling on the internet.  I feel unclean."
"Who the hell do you think you are, interrupting their family reunion just because you want something at the other end of the aisle? You should feel ashamed and the penalty should be that you have to invite them to your home so they can finish their get together in peace without a bunch of no good shopping cart pushers interrupting. 
Seriously though this crap infuriates me. I'm a get in and get out kind of shopper and when I see the herd gathered in an aisle I will either just rudely push through and dare someone to say something smart or go to the next aisle - depends how pissy my mood is.

"
So much worse than this is doorways. For fuck's sake, it's one thing to not want to cram toward the side of an aisle and have a conversation like you're on stage, all facing the same way. It is in the way, and you are doing it wrong, but it makes some sense to be doing it. But the doorway is one, tiny area. You literally walk in ANY direction, and you're no longer in the way of what is potentially the ONLY route from one side of the door to the other.
Or take up entire sidewalks. I'm sitting at a bus stop on an ample sidewalk right now and there is a whole wad of women who have just planted themselves not one foot away. They're just gabbing along while I complain about them on Reddit. It's glorious!
"How about people who do this in their cars going opposite directions down a 2 lane street.  Usually they'll start moving when they see another car coming but sometimes they still keep talking.  ""HEY FUCK FACE, THIS IS A GODDAM ROAD, MOVE YOUR ASS!"""
People who block aisles doing anything. Weighing the relative merits of three different corn chips? PULL OVER. I hate it so much that when I shop, I park out of the way at the end of the aisle, then bring whatever from that aisle back to the cart.
I agree on most every day. The only exception is camping. I absolutely love waking up in my tent, making coffee over a camp fire and enjoying the crisp air. 
"Waking up is fine. Even if I have to set my alarm for 4 hours from now and know going in that's all the sleep I'm going to get for now, I'm ok when the alarm goes off.

... but if somebody wakes me up before I intended to wake up, and moreso if it's something like a wrong number or a roommate doing something unnecessarily (or accidentally) loud outside my bedroom? Cry havoc."
"Reading this, I am imaging you slowly coming around out of sleep, and then suddenly leaping out of bed, veins throbbing, growling/screaming at the top of your lungs....

Actually seems a pretty good way to get pumped for the day!"
"Reading this, I am imaging you slowly coming around out of sleep, and then suddenly leaping out of bed, veins throbbing, growling/screaming at the top of your lungs....

Actually seems a pretty good way to get pumped for the day!"
I'm so glad I wake up and leave an hour before anyone else wakes up. I'm always a greater asshole in the morning to other people. Waking up, getting ready alone, and leaving before the sun comes up is really peaceful.
Today I didn't wake up with my alarm so my mother came into my room, turned on the lights, and then left, slamming the door. Made me so mad. Also it was at like 530 so it's not like I get up late. A simple push on the shoulder would be fine. 
"that happened to me the other day. I was on the treadmill and this guy slowly walks by, eyeballs me, then scoffs and walks away. I just thought to myself, ""why do you think i'm here asshole?"""
I'm pretty overweight myself and I'm fairly sure I'd giggle if I saw me wobbling and sweating on a treadmill... my gyms of choice have no mirrors opposite the machines for that reason...
"I know I am a dickhead at times

But what is your reaction too people who say calm down and then smirk or laugh? "
"It's a well established (and I think childish) argumentative tactic.

I knew a guy who did this all of the time. Once an argument got started he'd attack specific points relentlessly, ask pointed questions, and basically try and rile you up. The idea was to get you agitated, make you slip up somehow, force you to admit you were wrong on that point, and then use the leverage to win the argument. It was a game to him. There was a speaker who toured the country that he loved that was a huge proponent of it.

Now, I can see where this might be useful (with restraint), but I got tired of this shit. Any time I entered an argument with him and felt myself getting ticked off or knew he was just trying to get me angry I would end the conversation and tell him he was just making me angry and we'd have to resume the conversation tomorrow. Now, that would really get him pissed off..."
"I hear the ""calm down pisses me off"" thing a lot, and no one's ever given me a straight answer to my question. What would you prefer the other person to say? When someone near me is ranting and showing anger, I feel it. It tenses me up, locks my jaw and raises my blood pressure. I do not like it, it makes me mad. I do not want to be mad. If I can leave the room I will, but sometimes I can't. Honestly, what else can I do besides try to diffuse them? "
"You, sir, need to calm the fuck down about your *precious* pack of Gushers being all red.

Talk about your first world problems. The nerve of you. Least you can *afford* Gushers, Mr. Worthington McMoneypants."
"That's an instant rage button for my sister, too. When we were teens, I would abuse the fuck out of it. 

""I don't really want to watch this.""

""Jesus, calm the fuck down.""

""I was fucking calm, you bitch."""
"> When someone tells me to ""calm down"" or to ""just relax"".

i told someone to relax once because i was setting up sound for an event and troubleshooting something and they wouldn't shut the fuck up about their goddamned microphone even when i told them what i was working on and i would get to it.

that did indeed piss her right off."
"Let me preface this by stating I am the devil.

But if I am losing a long winded argument, and I know it internally, I always just subtly bringing up points that were long discussed earlier to agitate the other person.

Then I say ""calm down"" and ""relax, we are just trying to have a debate here""

They instantly go rage mode and I say ""listen, this just isn't worth it. I am done. Call it a draw"" and walk away.

I can't handle passive aggression. I really can't. Because then they get mad if you didn't get the hint or refuse to acknowledge it and its like if you don't confront me I CANT KNOW WHATS WRONG. Looking at you, boyfriend. 
"This gets to me so bad. I was in a grumpy mood the other day (not sure why, just one of those days) and my brother kept annoying me. I replied in very short answers to what he was saying as to not lose my temper, but he just wouldn't leave me alone. I finally had enough and snapped at him. His response?

*backs away slowly with hands raised, acting like I was about to hurt him* ""Okay, jeez Rsurect_, you're really testy today.""

My parents and sister thought that was the most hilarious thing and they started laughing. That only fueled my brother's fire more, and he kept saying ""Rsurect_'s testy, Rsurect_'s testy, Rsurect_'s testy!"" and giggling to no end.

YES, CONGRATS, YOU GUESSED IT. IM A LITTLE ON THE ANNOYED SIDE OF THINGS TODAY. THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT. DO YOU WANT A GODDAMN COOKIE. I OUGHTA SHOVE THE DAMN COOKIE UP YOUR ARSE, MY JESUS TITTYFUCKING CHRIST CHILD, SHUT THE HELL UP.

"Motherfucker, you're my angry time soulmate!! All it takes is a ""just calm down"" to push me from a 2 to an 11. Especially when you're already calm. Holy shit, I can feel my blood pressure rising now.

Also, I bought a box of gushers a few months ago. All of them are red. Fucking all of them. I have two pouches left, and I'm not holding my breath. And NO I will not fucking calm down!"
"For the love of all that is holy, fuck anyone who says ''calm down'' when you make a point that they can't counter. The worst is when they smile like they've just said the cleverest thing ever said by anyone anywhere.

*That* is the situation that will cause me to lose my calm and want to punch whoever said it."
"Sometimes I'm not even that mad but if someone says ""calm down"" they send me straight into pissed-off zone."
"On this note, I hate when someone can't bring up an issue without acting completely irrational about it. Literally screaming over the lid not being on the toothpaste? Calm the fuck down and talk to me when you aren't acting like a fucking infant.

Had an ex who would pull that shit, then act like I was the asshole for telling her to calm down. It doesn't matter what the issue is, if you can't bring it up to me while treating me like a human being, I'm not going to respect what you have to say. And if I already know telling you to calm down well piss you off? Well, guess what, you just pissed me off yelling at me for trivial shit. 

Not saying you don't have as legitimate complaint, but I've seen it both ways. My older brother pulled that shit, telling me I was freaking out if I looked the slightest bit annoyed. This would make me rage so gd hard. My ex, on the other hand, was a fucking lunatic. She was sensitive about ""calm down"", because she heard it near daily. She heard it near daily for good reason"

Yes! It's dismissive, shitty, condescending. Like my side of the argument isn't *valid* so I should just STFU and sit down. Screw you, buddy."
"> When someone tells me to ""calm down"" or to ""just relax"". 

honestly when i say this, it's because the person is panicking or is angry. what i really mean when I say this is: attempt to separate your emotions from the issue and think about it rationally. fuck your emotions, it prevents rational thought. if you're angry about something become a robot and think of a solution that gets you farther ahead (Even if it's lose/lose).

that being said, i value rationality over emotions."
"I can't remember the last time someone told me to *calm down* or *just relax*, because I try to act like a fucking adult. It's never excusable for an adult to raise their voice and yell about something, even if they're angry, or even if they're being baited into an argument. Heck, this situation is when it's most important to not raise your voice.

"I'm sorry- but people like you are my pet peeve.

 A good buddy of mine blew up in my face when I told him to calm down in the middle of a tense situation where we lost the girls we were with in a shady part of town (post a near fight with a thug who tried to intimidate my buddy). His fiance was in the group and he started panicking; which was when I told him to calm down.

Luckily I was calm and basically kept my mouth shut after his tirade where he blamed me for the girls getting lost (I put them in a cab and sent them off to our hotel- but they didn't show up). The girls later contacted us and were in a part of town I thought they might have gone to as the address is very similar to our hotel. 

If i wasn't calm my buddy and I would have probably fought it out, and seeing that I'm a lot stronger and more experienced in fighting people, it wouldn't have ended well for him."
I don't know you, but based off the contents of this post even I think you need to relax. These are not the words of a laid back person.
"Or they pull some incredible bullshit that pisses you off and they say, ""Why are you yelling?"" BECAUSE YOU PISSED ME OFF!"
I find myself doing the muttering constantly. It usually isn't even passive aggressive or anything bad, mostly just things I want to say but figure no one within ear shot gives a shit but my brain is telling me this needs to get out.
"Me talking to my brother:

Me: ""Hey dude my car isn't working right now and I have to get down to work. They're on the verge of firing people who they don't believe are 'necessary' so it is important for me to be on time.""

"There is an episode of American Dad where Roger just keeps doing this to Stan. Basically, Roger just keeps throwing secrets out into the open to Francine to take the heat off of himself. For example, Roger is using pretty much a whole container of some condiment of the food he's eating, and when Francine confronts him for being wasteful he tells her that Stan is spending heaps of money on something or other. Then Roger throws away the food because he's actually ""on a diet,"" while Francine bitches at Stan.

I didn't even know that was a thing! I wonder if that's why I get pissed off when a radio ad has the sound of liquid being poured into a glass.

Oh man, I used to know these people. They'd just sing everywhere constantly all the time. In groups. Ahhhhhhhh. 
"Yeah. Girl in my ap calculus has always been like this. ""Oh wow I'm the only one who got a 93? Hee hee."" One day she's gonna get injured patting herself on the back too hard."
As someone who sings a lot I feel self conscious about this. I have an above average singing voice but I sing because I love to sing. I often wonder if people think I'm trying to show off and will sometimes sing worse than I can to prove I'm not show boating.... I probably think too much.
At least she's good, the girl in my school who would do that fucking sucked. She went to Nashville and ended up homeless for a week because she couldn't get signed anywhere, but she's such a fucktard that she didn't even begin to think it was because she sucks, it's because they couldn't recognize real talent, not because she sings in an off key vibrato that makes you want to murder a nursery full of babies. 
What I think is worse when they think they can sing very well. When in fact when they sing all you want to do is cringe. 
What's even fucking worse is people who think they're great singers, that is, they sing all the time and nobody ever had the guts to tell them that they sound like shit, so they just assumed they're good at singing. At this point, all is lost, NOTHING is gonna stop them. Here comes their period of unstoppable confidence and annoying singing wherever the fuck they are. You just can't convince them they're horrible, it's too late now.

"People seeing everything someone does as showing off. Back in high school me and some friends would love to just dick around during gym class, trying fancy shit whenever we could. This was not to show anyone we could (hell, most it failed horribly), but just to see if we could pull any of it off.
And still, there would **always** be someone who had to yell at us to stop showing off. Just because you're too lazy to get off your ass and actually do something doesn't meaning anyone capable of jumping higher than half an inch is a show-off."

I do that sometimes, and but when I see people become irritated I stop and apologize. Then I usually accidentally start singing or humming again later. I feel so bad for the people who have to deal with me doing that.

After all this, she was just like, ""Oh, well, I don't know, I just know what I've been told.""

like, BITCH I JUST TOLD YOU OTHERWISE"
I guess I'm the opposite way with that second one.  It annoies me when a person will spontaneously throw in a new accent just for one word.  I understand that it's correct, but it hits my ear wrong.  Especially in supermarket commercials talking about Italian food.  >_>

We say Budapest and Belarus in English differently you're not special for knowing that. Then they aren't consistent. Why do you say Germany and not Deutschland professor?!  Why do you say Paris like we normally do and not like a Parisian or why are you saying Prague, don't you mean Praha professor!?

"> People who criticise me when I use a word they don't know or when I pronounce a foreign word as it's supposed to be.

I see this a lot. For some reason, there's a school of thought that says that engineers and scientists only use big or complicated words because they want to sound smart. That everything is actually really simple and everyone would get it instantly if the fucking eggheads would just speak normal english.

This is so wrong that I barely know where to start."
"One thing for me is when someone criticizes me (or anyone else) for mispronouncing a foreign word the speaker hasn't heard or a foreign last name.

The second one is difficult for me because I speak conversationally French and Spanish and I speak English as my first language so whenever I come across a work that is from French or Spanish I will use the accent, but if someone doesnt speak the language and butchers the word with a crap accent, it pisses me off.

If you try to pronounce a foreign word in a foreign accent and get it wrong , that's a dick move though.

Argh. I hate it when somebody in TF2 says the L'Etranger (the name of a pistol in that game) incorrectly over voice chat. And the worst part is not being to explain it to them, that it's not ''Let-ranger'' but ''Letrangeeeee'' (can't transcribe it; English isn't my first language)
If I see that you're arbitrarily using overly complicated words in an effort to sound superior, I'll call that shit out. I hate people like that.
I was once in Ecuador and had to take the worse shit of my life. I had eaten guinea pig, which is a pretty common thing to eat there, and it wasn't sitting well in my stomach at all. Basically I had to **RUN** into some bathroom and take the nastiest dump I had ever taken. Only then did I realize that not only was the bathroom out of toilet paper, there wasn't even a toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom. It wasn't even an option. All the toilet paper was located in the kitchen of the restaurant (They do this because people are so poor that they will  just steal the TP out of public bathrooms.) I literally had to pull up my pants over my shit-covered ass and waddle out of the bathroom into the kitchen and grab a whole bunch of toilet paper then head back to the bathroom. Needless to say, I had to make more than one trip back to the kitchen.

I'm learning Italian, so I know how Italian words are pronounced, but I feel like such a dick for some reason when I'm saying stuff in English and an Italian word comes up. I just ignore its proper pronunciation and move on.

I don't understand why people don't check for toilet paper *before* they shit. Seriously, am I the only one who does this? You sit there on average for eight minutes and you don't think to check for anything to clean your asshole with?
Oh my god yes. Like two weeks ago I was early to university by about 30 minutes and so I went to take a dump. Now normally I check the tp everytime but for whatever reason this time I didn't. So I finish and realize no tp. Well this washroom isn't too too frequented but there's a guy in the stall two over so I just think I'll wait till he gets up and just ask him cause I don't want to risk a waddle. But no this guy is taking a nap or something so I wait a bit. Some guy comes in and goes for a piss so I ask him. He's some foreign guy so he just totally ignores me. Well now my class in like 5 minutes and the halls are getting packed so there's no way I'm doing the stall to stall waddle. So I call my friend and he comes and tosses tp under the stall. Never again friends never again. 
I am so happy I've never met anyone who 1) hasn't read a book or 2) isn't trying to further their education/see it as a good thing. Everyone I'm surrounded by in town is all for education past the undergrad route! I couldn't imagine people criticizing others for wanting to gain more intelligence!

Hopefully it gets better with age.  I was pretty insecure when I was younger, and there is nothing worse than being the jealous one and not being able to trust your SO.  Once you realize there is nothing you can do but trust them, things will become much better for you when they are away.

Use it as an ego boost. They think your girlfriend is attractive, your girlfriend finds you attractive. It's like an indirect compliment, up to a point
Either she's yours, and other guys are wasting their time, or she isn't really yours and one of them has a chance to charm her away from you. In the latter case, you're probably better off without her. It's win-win, so don't worry about it.
Just got here 7 hrs later to say I feel you bro. The thought of someone filtering with my gf makes me instantly mad... Unfortunately when I'm mad I'm a huge dick and just and overall bad person who will look for someone to destroy it's life :/
I don't mind this. It's harmless and it gives her a little ego boost. I'm the one who benefits in the end. I treat her well, so I don't worry about her cheating..if she did cheat I would just break up with her and be glad I found out before things got really serious (marriage). 
Oh my god.. I'm a little insecure, nothing over the top, but I get really pissed off when this happens. Fuck those guys they can find some other fucking girl.

"I almost enjoy that. I'm jealous and protective enough so she knows where I stand, but I also know that she can stand her own ground and make her own decisions.

Because I know that she's coming home with me, and they can do whatever they want, and they'll still fail. She's beautiful, intelligent, funny, and interesting. She's mine. Those other guys won't take her home and it makes me feel wanted and victorious. I like that feeling.

That said, leave my girlfriend alone. "
"What? Dude, it's the best.

1. They're hitting on her so you've probably got yourself quite a gorgeous lady.

2. She's **your** girlfriend. No one else's. She chose you.

3. If she did randomly fall in love with some random guy spitting game at her, then you'd be better off, no?

I love walking around malls with my girlfriend, noticing guys stare at her. Total confidence boost."
Don't get angry at men doing what is natural and appreciating your beautiful partner.  Get angry if she flirts back.

1) No guys are hitting on your girl. You win! (Sorta...)

2) Guys are hitting on your girl. Congratulations, you've found yourself a woman who is some minimum degree of desirable. You win!

2a) She doesn't cheat on you or run off with one of these other guys. You win!

2b) She does cheat on you or run away, in which case she wasn't worth your time anyway and you just got rid of some deadweight. You win!"
Best thing to do is put her to a test. Get one of your good looking friends that she doesn't know to come up and hit on her when you aren't around. If she reciprocates then the bitch cant be trusted and you just saved yourself a lot of pain and future anguish.
This actually happens to my girlfriend. We go to different schools, but whenever we facetime Or text she tells me how she had to slap some guy for asking her out, knowing fully well she is in a relationship. That shit gets me fucking pissed.
"So much rage on this. I have severe depression, and I hate it when people are just like ""you're just having a bad day, cheer up."" I WISH IT WERE THAT EASY BITCH.

And on that second one, I am a recovering anorexic, and when people told me I looked disgusting or some other horrible comment... that just made it WORSE. Now I get it on the other end, ""You should go back to where you were, you're getting fat."" Gee, thanks."
"Wait for them to start up on suicide. ""They're weaklings, no one should help someone who has attempted, let them die""."

"Or when people use mental illnesses they don't have as an excuse or casually mention they have it with no formal diagnosis.

""lol I get distracted so easily. I AM SO ADHD. OMG A SQUIRREL!""
""I like organizing my bookshelves. LOL SO OCD LOL""
""I'm an introvert and I like Pokemon MUST BE HIGH FUNCTIONING AUTISM LOL""

No. People with these conditions (people who REALLY HAVE THEM) fucking KNOW it. The definition of a mental illness involves having your day to day functions so impaired by the condition that you can't function like other people. When you act this way you shit all over people who really suffer from these conditions.

So don't pretend to have a condition/use one as an excuse unless you've been diagnosed by an actual psychologist."

I've heard from an anorexic person on reddit that telling someone with anorexia to eat more is like telling an alcoholic to stop drinking alcoholic beverages.

This is illegal in Norway. Also, you may die. A girl in my class was texting while she was driving, dropped her phone, and started to search for it on the floor WHILE STILL DRIVING. She drove over the edge of a quarry, and was luckily stopped by a big tree on the way down. She lived, but got severely injured. Another girl in our school texted and crashed into a Taxi, klling herself and two old ladies. Only the taxi driver lived. So in our school they were very adamant about informing everyone on the dangers of texting and driving.
If it's an honest mistake and they quickly turn it off afterwards, it's irritating - but not unforgivable. But when someone actually answers it, and starts having a full-blown conversation? Seriously, that makes me rage. 
"Cellphone usage in a movie theatre in general.

On sunday I went to the theatre to see Gravty and I kept seeing this glint through the corner of my eye. It was someone checking out their cellphone, like, every 5 minutes. "
every single one of my friends thinks it's okay to just text during a movie. I DID NOT pay $10 to watch your bright ass phone light up every 5 minutes....it totally breaks the moment that the film is trying to create!
"or texting during movies. I'm watching a film right now and there is this dick that keeps texting on his phone.
"
When I went to see Inseption in theaters, some asshat had lost their phone so they spent the entire movie calling it. Over and over again. It has slipped down somewhere weird and no one could find it during the movie. Super fucking annoying. 
Even worse? When a cellphone goes off at a funeral. Had it happen twice at family ones, you don't know how much I wanted to yell at those fucking people :/ 
"It's not even like, the movie theater. I was on the bus yesterday and this guy stood there while his phone was going off in his pocket blaring some Indian music. 

I have no problem with Indian music, I do have a problem when you stand there talking to your friend, who just asked if you were going to answer it while the *entire* bus stares at you, and you scoff and say fuck that. 

I almost punched him in the pocket."
I work at a theater, and although other employees don't care, if you're doing ANYTHING noticeable on your phone, I'm gonna come up to you and tell you you're gonna have to leave if it happens again. Talking on the phone? Get the fuck out, now.
"I experienced this while watching a production of woman in black. Yes, a play, not the movie. A PLAY! A horror play at that! It was a REALLY tense part where the main dude's walking about the house at night (I think it was the part where he finds the nursery), and then suddenly an incredibly poppy MIDI ringtone plays, and then I can't help but hear this guy mumbling into his phone saying ""Um, sorry mum, I can't talk. I'm watching a play right now""."
"Two weeks ago I went to the symphony.  The guy in front of me had his iphone out to take pictures.  While they were playing.

-shutter click- "
What pisses me off is when someone's phone goes off at an inappropriate time and they just ignore it until it stops ringing. 
I never thought twice about it until a year into our relationship my girlfriend confessed to me that she had been raped by an aboriginal man when she was young, now I feel like there is a cancer inside of me entirely made of rage and hatred that is very unstable. I'm not quite sure how to cope with it, it's been 4 years since she told me.
This. Especially against children. Whenever I accidentally see a headline about it, I get physically sick. I don't read about it ever because it puts me in a bad place. That shit literally makes me want to do what Rainn Wilson's character did in the movie Super and fuck people up. Except not in a funny way, in a terribly violent way. 
I am there with you... I remember the first time I experienced this, I was watching The Hills Have Eyes. I almost had to get up and walk out, I was so furious. From then on, I think twice about watching a movie if I hear it has a rape scene in it. 
I literally can't read any reddit thread that mentions sexual abuse because the dangerous opinions some redditors have makes me so angry and upset that I get literally anxious because I'm so scared about all the people in danger because of thoughts like theirs and then I get horribly depressed and YES I KNOW I NEED THERAPY I AM GETTING IT BUT SHITTY OPINIONS ABOUT RAPE IS ONE THING THAT MAKES ME SO STRESSED I GET CLINICALLY DEPRESSED. 
Same, I get a murderous rage that builds up so fast I want to a) go on a rampage, and b) I feel like I could be violently ill at any given moment. It makes me feel physically ill.  
"I have to avoid a lot of tv shows, movies, even some videogames because of it. I shake, and don't let anyone touch me.

Its to the point now where I have to check the movies ratings and such before I go to see it, just in case. "
"Holy shit a week ago I just found out that the girl I am dating was abused by hers moms ex boyfriend.

When I was told about this I just want to a walk my mom tough that I fell penny for the girl but I just fell so bad so anger that someone I care about had been abused and I can't help her.

I was just furious I want just found the asshole and punch the shit out off him.

Serious if one day I meet him I really don't know how I would react.

I doesn't help that a uncle of mine did that to her too and worst in exchange for food.

I really need play some games and blow something."
"I overheard a convo where a gal was claiming that the public school system (in America) was operating under some ""hidden agenda"" to turn all children who attend public school into ""Nazi Youth"".  Say Whaaaaaat?  "
"I actually enjoy talking to these people just to see how far down the crazy rabbit hole I can get them to go.  Inevitably they will contradict themselves, and when you ask about it you can see their blood boil.

It is hilarious."
"Omg...there's this crazy woman who always posts stuff on my town's FB page. Recently she went on a rant about how the pope is contacting aliens to get them to come to Earth so he could convert them to Catholicism. W T F. She also throws around the word ""agenda"" a lot, like the ""gay agenda"" or ""liberal agenda"". What is this ""agenda""?! "
If you mean *all* the facts, everyone talks without knowing all the facts. With few exceptions, anytime there's a discussion about anything, neither party knows 100% of the facts. 
"Walked past 2 girls a few weeks ago, ""can you believe some people dont believe in satan? Thats crazy""

O_o"
"I just want to point out that this goes both ways.

As a religious person (read: not fanatic) I get upset when people who aren't my religion try to tell me about things in the Bible that aren't true.  Then refuse to accept the contextual answer I give them because it doesn't fit their idea of my religion. "
It is acceptable to talk about things you don't have all the facts on if you admit as much both to the other person and to yourself.
"Fanatics are one thing but what bothers me is when people talk about god in some matter a fact way, as if they were talking about the weather. I don't mean as an expression but just assuming that ""he"" exists and conforming their language to reflect that fact. No you dumb shit, he ""might"" exist and you can ""believe"" he exists but do not infringe your belief on everybody else by speaking as if he ""does"" exist.  "
they're pro trolls. you getting angry at them is the equivalent to feeding an online troll. if nobody paid attention to them they'd go away
"Came here to say this. I feel nothing but unbridled rage whenever I see that name.

[Link! Link for the lazy! Get your link here! Read all about it! Ann Coulter does an AMA! Read all about it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1owtas/i_am_ann_coulter_bestselling_author_ama/)
"I read the AMA after seeing your comment, and couldn't agree more.  

Yes, her politics are totally opposite of mine, but I wanted to hear what she had to say.  She's an embarassment.  Do you think John McCain, Mitt Romney, or Paul Ryan would act like that?  How about Condoleezza Rice?  No way.  

I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the well thought out questions posed by redditors.  Most of them showed the maturity AC lacked.  "
Coulter isn't someone to look to for a mature, intelligent opinion on anything. If her intent were to use information and rationality to argue a conservative viewpoint, I could respect it. However, she has made clear for years that her only goal is to use vitriol and antagonism for her straw men in order to sell books and get on TV.
Read 3 comments and rage quit the fuck out of that one. I almost have considered murdering that worthless POS.
"As a moderate leaning conservative, I can see now why people hate Ann Coulter. She is Piers Morgan with breasts. Actually, I think Piers Morgan is less immature than she is.

There was no intellect coming from that AMA or her show at all. "
"It was hilarious when she accidentally started posting in /r/books at first though.

EDIT: [Link] (http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1owrha/iama_n_author_ama/)"
"> every opportunity to bash Obamacare.

Even the part where she failed to log in and complained about it on twitter."
"> Instead, she showed the maturity of a twelve year old, didn't answer the questions and used every opportunity to bash Obamacare. 

That's all she has. That's why people can't stand her. "
Anyone who's heard her say more than three sentences knows this is all she does.  And now you do too.
Wow that AMA sucked so bad. She answered like 15 questions and didn't even address any actual questions that were posed.
"Redditors weren't much better to be honest.
EDIT: Let me explain then. Even if I disagree with her ""opinions"", I was interested in hearing what she might have to say. She acted like 12 year old, yes. But so did redditors. Most top comments were not questions at all, just bad jokes. Those few answers she had were heavily downvoted. "
[Petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/governor-rick-scott-state-of-florida-pardon-ryan-holle) for his pardon on Change.org, if this enraged you as much as it did me. The dude was almost a teenager when this happened. Thanks for bringing this to light. 
Sorry, but no. He willingly lent his car to someone going to commit a crime - what he thought was burglary. However, with any crime there's always the risk of escalation, and he should have taken that into account. By lending the car for a burglary he made the murder possible, and was fully aware of the possibility of the crime escalating. I think he deserves the punishment for an accomplice to a murder.
How different would this have been if he gave no hinting to a possibility of knowing about the burglary.  Like is it a situation where that bullshit law still would have applied but it wouldn't be used or something?

I like walking in the wind, but riding a bicycle in the wind? No way. It's especially annoying when you turn around, and you STILL have a headwind! What happened there? You have a headwind going one way, so logically, it will be a tail wind if you turn 180 degrees.
Do you get mad at people who smoke cigarettes and drink around their children as well? Curious as to the reasoning behind #1.
I think it's okay as long as you aren't, like, blowing the smoke in their face. I have many friends with kids who smoke cannabis in front of their kids, and they're the best parents I know. The most tolerant kids I know, too.
As a kid my mom would sometimes take me out to Burger King and we'd get cinnaminnies.  I loved it.  She doesn't like the inside of fast food restaurants because they can be loud or too cold so we would eat in the car.  But then she'd listen to the radio and get mad at me for talking to her.  I stopped going with her.
This, and when I walk by big apartment buildings in February and still see Christmas trees in like 10 of the windows.  Lazy fucks.
"mine is anything to do with the word ""feeding""

someone is 1/3/3, that is not fucking feeding. people just throw that word around like ""ughh bot feed"" its so fucking stupid. that is a person behind that character and they are having a rough time

they attach this word to it as if ""feeding"" is the worst possible thing you can do and you can slam that term onto someone as a means to vindicate yourself for being a complete fucking asshole because the ""feeders"" are the bad guys. its so fucking childish, you can be mad for someone intentionally trying to screw up your game, but for someone who is trying and failing they have just as much a right to fail however hard they have to. just because you are in the game doesnt mean every other person in that game has to be accountable to you

Sorry. I happen to be severely sensitive to light, so sometimes I really do need sunglasses inside because it's still so bright it burns. I get a lot of annoyed looks from people. Just keep in mind sometimes the person is like me.
"Sensitive eyes? Doesn't really bug me, but I can see where you're coming from.

They could be hungover though. I'd much rather look at the sunglasses than their melting face."
For number 2, where would this be? I'm from Canada and I've NEVER heard of anything like this. That's awful.
Also include rap in that category. Rap isn't shit music as general consensus is, fuck it takes talent to freestyle and stuff. Just because mainstream and MTV shove superficial crap doesn't make the genre shit. There is shit stuff in every damn thing.. music, movies, presidents, porn, sports, automobiles, literature, The Wire, reddit, quora etc etc., what not. shit. 
"For me it's anyone who judges the music that someone else listen's to.

I personally don't like really hard metal.  But if you do, good for you, I'm glad you found something you enjoy.

Just don't rag on me for likeing say Jason Mraz "
My mother. Not the talentless part, she just thinks the devil is inside them, why else would they scream like that?
Metal bands always put on a hell of a good show. I was never a Slayer fan in the past. I always considered them just noise until I saw them live. They blew my mind and now I'm a huge fan. It takes a lot of talent to consistently play fast and furiously for entire set. 
"I find a lot of metal contains amazing instrumentals and percussion, only to be ruined by the vocals. Whether or not it's hard to do doesn't make it any more musical. And I'm not saying growling/screaming vocals are always bad. They're often appropriate, but *much more often* quite bland.   
  
I've had a lot of metal bands recommended to me that really do have great, varied, creative, technical guitar and drum parts. But I just can't get over the consistent, monotone, growling vocals on every single track."
"Ah yes. And also referring to it as a ""phase"" despite that fact it's quite a persistent phase that has lasted all my life "
Thank you for bringing this up. Metal is by far my favorite genre and being a drummer, it also commands most of my respect and attention due to the technicality and mental/physical demands. The majority of my friends enjoy the fact that *I* enjoy playing the music but they also think it's like for crazy people that have a affinity for devil worship. It's just music. 
"> people who claim metal is talentless screaming.

I.E. One of my roommates... I don't even listen to that much metal, but when i do he gets all pissy for ""Blasting their ears with talentless music"". Bitch, you listen your pop music much louder then this. 
"
It takes a certain technique to be able to do that right. Even when you're talking about a screamo band like Lord Snow or pg.99 (who are both fucking AWESOME), there's something to be said about a person who is willing to sacrifice the long term use of vocal tracts to get what you want out of your art.
I've had to deal with people who say stuff like that for years. Also, why is it I'm not allowed to have both Mozart and Morbid Angel on my iPod? My tastes vary!
"""You're music is terrible! You should listen to this rap music that's about shooting people, doing drugs, and fucking random sluts! That's what a Christian would listen to, you satanist!""

It's so annoying. They shouldn't talk about something they know absolutely NOTHING about. "
"These people have poor taste. Metal is awesome.

edit: Yeah, I was being harsh, there's good and bad in every genre. It is annoying when people cut out an entire genre. 

Although Christian rock is still weird. "
why does it matter to you if people don't like the same music as you? My favorite music is irish folkmusic and people don't like that, doesn't mean I can't enjoy it 100%
"Especially people who think metal is *only* screaming (regardless of talent).

I'm not a fan of most extreme metal. I dont like black metal, anything core, or death metal (with a few exceptions, ex. Amon Amarth, Dethklok, etc.). Because of this, it pisses me off to no end when someone says ""Geez dude, why do you listen to all that screaming and banging and weird noise crap?"" Shut up. Listen to this Iron Maiden. Listen to this Metallica. Oh here, have some Judas Priest, Motörhead, Megadeth, Hammerfall, Stratovarius, and THESE HUNDREDS OF OTHER BANDS WHO SING CLEANLY AND AREN'T JUST NOISE. 

That said, some metalheads piss me off as well with how narrow-minded they are. I mentioned that I don't like extreme metal--but if you do, *I'm totally fine with that.* Usually, if you don't like something someone else likes, then FUCK YOU AND YOUR STUPID TASTE YOU'RE NOT A TRUE METALHEAD. Oh, by the way, I mentioned Core up above. For the love of God can we stop hating on them so much? I don't like it at all. But i have friends who are HUGE metalcore fans. And I'm okay. I don't call their music ""false"" or ""stupid,"" I just don't listen to it. End of story.

Sorry for rant. METAAAAAAALLLLLLL

"That's because they usually listen to Pop music only.

Awesome, downvoted because I don't like Pop music and made a sarcastic comment."
"Piggybacking off this to say: People who think electronic music is ""just some dude pressing play on a laptop"""

Until that last sentence I thought you were in the UK. I guess that would be the same for people in a number of countries around the world.
"I worked at the welfare department for a little over a year. It's ridiculous the things you see. Generational welfare is definitely a thing and it's been getting worse.

Sadly abuse of the system not only ruins the system for those who truly need it but it also jaded me the fuck out to the point that by the end of my time there I hardly gave a fuck and had to constantly remind myself that these were people I was there to help. "
This is a problem caused by the system itself, not the people. If you could sit on your ass all day and make *more* money than you make now, why the fuck wouldn't you? If these people get a minimum wage job, they lose access to the program, but actually make less money every year. It's all about incentives, people. Yes, trying to help the poor out by giving them money is a noble thing to do, and I'm sure you socialists feel quite high and mighty about it. However, it's an inefficient and ineffectual way of helping the poor.
"This exasperates me when I meet someone who doesn't actually know what a CPC is (confusing it with a legitimate healthcare center) and then I have to find a way to quell my rage for five seconds to explain it to them. I'm not mad at that person, it just kills me to know that not only do CPCs exist, but that there are occasions that they do succeed in misleading people. 


Oh man instant eye twitching..."
"Phoenician here! I know where about ten ""crisis pregnancy centers"" are located, but only know where two planned parenthoods are at. "
It's not all CPC's. There's no problem with what they stand for, but the way they try to portray that message is borderline unethical.
"The first half of the first paragraph I was thinking ""what's wrong with that. People should talk about these things, even if it's in a biased way, it's better than none.""
Then I was like ""Ohhh. Sometimes I wish I didn't share the same title with other Christians."""
"On a similar note, I got angry the other day when I went to my GP's office in the UK, and in the waiting room the only pamphlet on abortion had been produced by a pro-life group. It was basically just a very long list of the risks of abortion, with no indication of how likely those risks actually are, and nothing at all about the risks of pregnancy. Surely if you're going to tell someone all about the risks of having a medical procedure, it also makes sense to tell them about the risks of NOT having the procedure?

Finland. Finland is a perfect example as to why homework, standardized tests and limited-recess is bad.
"I just got yelled at on another thread for explaining that they are not the same thing. One person I know was trying to be nice after my daughter died from a genetic disorder. She told me she kinda understood what it was like to lose a child because her dog was her baby and she would be beside herself if he died. I didn't get mad at her, because I know she was trying to be nice, but it is not even close. Someone yelled at me and said, ""how do you know what she is feeling."" Sorry, it's not even close. We expect to outlive our pets (even if we wish that weren't true). You aren't supposed to outlive your child.

I also had a friend posting on Facebook on how she thinks her puppy is more work than a child. Yeah, I have a ten month old, I beg to differ. I left it alone, but I wanted to say something. I love my pets, they can be a lot of work, but it is not the same thing at all."
"> People who compare having a pet to having a child...are you serious!

I'm a little ashamed to say that my wife and I did this to a small degree with our dog before we had children. It would piss our friends with kids off to no end. Now that I have kids, I'm right there with you. We have a (different) dog now, and I'm very fond of him, but it's nothing like the love I feel for my kids.  But, to be fair, it's hard to describe the love a parent has for a child to those who haven't experienced it.

Funny story... Wife was talking with some work friends about going out for the evening. Enter an acquainance. Someone asked my wife what we would be doing with the ""kid"" (our dog) when we went out. She answered very casually that we would put him in the kennel until we got home. I'm told the look on the face of the acquaintance was priceless.

I once called the cops on a person in front of me who had their child in the back seat with no restraints. He was standing on the back seat looking at me and putting his hands out the window. It was scary.
I feel like we would get along really well if we weren't busy rage-hating each other with the burning intensity of a thousand murder-suns.
Or just starring at a cellphone is general when you are with other people. A friend of mine was aaaalways doing it and one day he told me that he spoke to his wife and they both decided to take it down a notch with the phones. I was relieved. Next day: as if nothing happened.
Bit different when you're away for business. Eating in restaurants can be a necessity and if your waitress sees you on the phone surely they should just wait before approaching you. 
Well if you are calling a movie good or bad based on it's attributes you ARE technically being a critic.
My problem with this is that if you are going to Transformers and you expect some grand plot and character development, fuck you.  Seriously if you expect anything more than robots hitting each other gtfo.
Basically having an opinion that's not based on your immediate reaction seems to be a bad thing to a lot of people. It's like the opposite of elitism.

What's worse is people who think climate change is caused by people. Think of how long this earth has been here.

"I've never had that problem so it never occurred to me that it would bother some people. Some friends and I were out drinking and I ""booped"" one of them in the nose as a joke. He thought the appropriate response was to lose his shit, punch me in the temple, and throw a bottle at my face.

I'll couple that with people who complain that it's too expensive to eat healthy food.  No, it's actually cheaper, but you have to be able to do more than open a box or can.
On the flip, I'm 19 years old and I'm absolutely clueless in the kitchen. I realize that I'm going to have to move out once I graduate from university and eating healthy is key.

Or both, at the same time."
Obligatory comment:  please do hate the extremists, but remember that they are not the majority.  Feminism is about equality.  Some people from any group are going to be assholes though.
"I think the word you're looking for is [misandry.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misandry)

I'm a dude and I agree with a lot of what feminsim has to say.  But when you start hating men it stops being feminism. 

"
Misandry is not the same as feminism. It is hard to go over the top with feminism and still be feminist. 
Feminazi! I'm a woman and they drive me nuts. I'm a stay at home mom, so to them I am worst than Hitler. I'm sorry I think feminism is a choice and I have the ability to raise my own daughter and so I am. It is what I want. It's not that I can't work or I am unwilling. It is that raising my child comes first. I don't think I should be entitled to anything because I am a woman. I don't care of people have a different opinion than me, but I can't stand when they think they have the right to judge.
"Feminism by definition aims to minimize gender discrimination against women, so Feminism by definition can't be extreme.

There are dogmatic ""feminists"" however, who are unwilling to change their opinion even when they have been empirically discredited."
I couldn't agree more. If you are smoking in your car keep that shit in your car, don't bitch about it ruining the resale value or it leave a stale smell. Don't fucking smoke if it is so bad.
"My Grandmother did that once.  She was stopped at a red light while riding her bike to work, the person in the truck in front of her tossed his butt out of his window.  She picked it up, tossed it in his window, and politely said ""help prevent forest fires.""

This answer should be at the top, not because your right but because of this stupid fucking age elitism trend on reddit. Seriously, one generation isn't worse than another (don't even get me started on how you just generalized a whole generation). I mean come ON,your parents and grandparents probably thought your generation was the worst. And who fucking cares about hat brims? Seriously get over yourself
Fuck those people. I don't see any reason why we should respect cranky racist bigots who bitch about the younger generation doing the same crap they did 60 years earlier.
I think this has happened with every generation ever since the 20th century. Technology had just been progressing so fast. I bet when he grows up, there will be some new piece of technology that his kids will want and he will think about how lucky they have it.
"If I had to label one bad thing I did while driving, it would be tailgating. I am normally completely sane behind the wheel, may drive a little fast, but nothing crazy. Also very attentive of whats going on; I avoid texting/playing on my phone while driving. But for SOME STUPID REASON my brain thinks ""Hey maybe if I get closer to this guy, he will notice and go faster, so we can speed up."" That then instantly turns into ""C'mon guy, fuckin' SPEED UP!"" And then by the time I pass him/her, I am in a furious rage that I had to put up with their slowness. But if anyone rides me, I call them an asshole. Sorry for my stupidity. "
"Same here.  I go as fast as the car ahead of me, but I try to maintain a safe following distance (approximately 3 seconds).  On my daily commute, it seems everybody tailgates, I see people tailgating other tailgaters, but driving with a safe following distance makes people extra insane I think.  I move over to the right lane when it's safe to do so, then move back right behind them and say to myself, ""Good job, asshole.  Look where you are now, stuck behind the person ahead of me.""

Also, much of this is a windy mountain freeway that has daily serious accidents due to idiot drivers."
this may be one of the few things in this thread that is really and honestly justified. It is just not safe. One time there was this chick inches from my bumper texting. I just stopped, threw up the e brake, and waited.

Don't even get me started. However I notice the good ones that know that being on the road means that they have to follow rules. Even signaled with his arms. Faith in humanity restored a bit.
My blood started boiling as soon as I saw the word 'bicyclists.' I hate how they want to be treated like either pedestrians or cars, depending on which is more convenient for them at the moment. And I always get stuck behind them on the road when they are right next to the sidewalks and trails that are meant for bikes. But when I'm running on those same paths, they've suddenly learned to go quite fast and frequently almost barrel me over.
"I feel the exact same, except not every bicyclist, I live in Copenhagen so yeah, it's mostly those who go on their racing bicycles with their ""bogus"" skinny latex whatever sponsored bullshit outfits who go racing eachother in the middle of the fucking road and don't let cars pass even when you beep at them. 
It's like they think they are a part of tour de france.. 
Rant over. "
I'm with you there! I take a (somewhat environmentally friendly) bus in to work everyday; as soon as it reaches the city center, the combination of narrower roads and cyclists means that the bus must reduce to the speed of the blissfully dawdling cyclist in front. That is of course until a red traffic light, where said cyclist cruises straight through (ignoring pedestrian safety) and of course the bus must wait. Yes, cyclists are being environmental, but some of us live too far out of the city for it to be practical every day - I find it, in an odd sense, selfish of a single cyclist to restrict the timely transport of a group of people on a bus.
"I work in Oakland, ca, and it's a very ""bike"" friendly city which means I get cut off by a cyclist at least 2x a day.  And don't even get me started on the POS cyclists that drag their bikes onto ridiculously crowded BART trains and then lecture everyone else about how they're saving the planet (while simultaneously hitting 20 people with their bikes).

"Along the same lines, accuse me of something I haven't done, and I wil instantly fill with riteous rage...  My wife did it one time only.  She saw ""this look"" come across my face and knew she was wrong before I even started speaking.

I actually feel bad now. I was arguing with one redditor for an entire day over some bullshit thing. I should go say sorry to her now.
That'd piss me off too because it would make me want a cigarette, but it's wrong 'cause people should be allowed to have toys.
That reminds me of when I was in 4th grade and I *loved* correcting the teacher. I got in trouble for it one time, and that was when I was wrong about correcting her. She actually didn't mind so long as I was actually right. I did get one kid suspended because he flipped a shit about me correcting a 35 year old with a master's degree.
I had the same problem in school.  You are right, and you shouldn't be treated badly, but you will be. You should start practicing not letting this bother you.  Asshole bosses are everywhere. Asshole cops, asshole politicians, assholes at the airport, asshole customers.  Getting along with assholes is an important life skill, because assholes have authority and assholes help pay the bills.
"Can't the apostrophe in ""it's"" be used as posessive and ""it is"" or am i remembering 4th grade grammar wrong?"

"Correct me if I've misunderstood you, but... I cannot imagine a scenario in which someone could be obviously/necessarily non-disabled. Allow me to demonstrate:

Let X stand for a disability, and you say that for every X, if X is not obvious(necessarily true), then it is necessarily the case that X is false. (~nec. X ---> nec.~X). We need to provide one possible scenario in which ~nec. X is true but nec. ~X is false. 

Suppose that some X is not obvious, and thus not necessarily the case. This means only that X is not exclusively true or false in every possible scenario available to you. So possibly X and possibly not X, and thus, 'not necessarily X' is true. 

In order for X to be necessarily false, it would have to be the case that in every scenario available to you, X is false. However, we already know from before that X is at least possible for you, and thus, that X is necessarily false does not follow from not necessarily X. 

So for you, it is not the case that if X is not necessary, then necessarily not X. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of possible X's that are not obvious/necessary X's. I only need one possible X, such as narcolepsy, in order to falsify your claim. The only other option for you would be to say that you are not aware of situations in which non-obvious disabilities are possible disabilities. In this case, we would call yours a blind position, and both obvious and non-obvious disabilities would be vacuously true for you. "

"I hate when people put their headphones around their neck and blast music from them too. Fuck you, headphones are not to be used as speakers so I'm stuck hearing your ""mixtape"" that is entirely Nicki Minaj.  

THATS NOT EVEN A MIX, ITS A GODDAMN CD. "
"Latin blasting Latin music, tell him to turn it off, you're racist.
Black blasting hip hop, tell him to turn it off, you're racist.
White blasting rock, tell him to turn it off, everything's OK."
Oh, fuck this. Especially when they bitch and moan about some unimportant farce of their miserable excuse of an existence. 
There was a girl in one of my classes first semester of college. Before class started, she would sit there with her beats by Dre on (big shocker). Her music was so loud that despite the headphones being placed over her ears, the entire class could hear every single tiny detail in the music perfectly. I was shocked that she could even hear at all. 
I feel the same way. Unfortunately, I lost a game of chicken with a seagull at Cedar Point this past summer, and speaker phone is the only way I can make calls. I have become my own worst enemy.
Not when you're the guy nexting to me sucking it up at some candy crush like game with the volume all the way up.  It was so loud the little happy bling noise actually made people wince.  Fucker.
If you play it through a proper music playing device, and its at a tasteful volume, I have no problems. But when you play it as loud as your fucking iPhone will go, it ceases to be music and instead becomes garbled static and it's *extremely* annoying.
If I'm on a crowded subway car at 7am, I probably don't want to hear your music.  And I certainly don't want to be able to hear it over my music which is playing at a normal volume through my own headphones in my ears.  Its just a courtesy. 
"Same here, proud dad moment for me just last week.  

Get call from school's guidance counselor, tells me he witnessed my son (12 in 7th grade), stand up to a kid who was bullying another kid.  Bully was an 8th grader, picking on a 6th grader or something.  Says my boy pulled him off of the younger kid, told him to ""pick on somebody his own size""  (my boy is taller for his age), or to ""get lost"". 

Bully takes a shot, has a bad time.  Hallway clears and everybody goes back to class.


I ask my son if he knew the kid he risk trouble for, he says ""Does it matter if I knew him?""  Hell no son, good job, let's go get ice cream :-)

Best part, I ask the counselor how much trouble my son is in, he says ""No child that stands up for other kids, will ever be in trouble on my watch""

GGG counselor, there are still quality educators out there :-)"
Yea my dad always taught me to never start a fight, but always finish it. I got picked on a bit when I was younger but I've always been big so once a bully put his hands on me I'd start fighting and usually win. The principal would call my dad in and try to get me in trouble and my dad would just laugh and say, too bad kid got what he deserved.
"My dad told me this when I was a kid.  So I goaded other kids into swinging first so I could knock the snot out of them and make my dad proud.  

We had a very interesting parent teacher conference."
"tell the bully your dad will give you 10$ for every one of his teeth you can knock out before you get suspended and you have your eye on a new bike.

then see if he still wants a fight

*disclaimer, you may have to look a little crazy to pull this off. "
Better to get suspended for sticking up for yourself and kicking his ass than throwing one punch and getting ridiculed still.
Same. My dad told me to avoid fights, but if I couldn't to be damn sure I got the first punch in. I never had to use this, but I always knew my parents would back me up if I did. My dad also made sure both my sister and I took self defense classes. He didn't teach us to be afraid of the world. He wanted us to be aware of our surroundings and how to take care of ourselves so we didn't have to be afraid. I will be doing the same for my daughter (and my husband is completely on board with it too).
"My grandpa grew up in a small farming town in the '30s, and their policy was that if a fight broke out, the two boys would be led into the principal's office, given boxing gloves, and allowed to box if they still wanted to.  
  
He said it was actually quite effective since most fights start over stupid reasons and overactive teen hormones. When forced into a formal setting with the principal watching, the boys usually realized how dumb they were acting and were embarrassed to keep fighting.  
  
On the rare occasion that they really *did* need to get it out of their system, the boxing gloves were quite large and had a bunch of extra padding. They could wail on each other and not do much harm.  "
My kids would get a reward...as long as it didn't happen too often.  Though, they'd obviously have to show me that it was self defense to avoid abusing it.
"I'm still thinking about the ""how to"" teach this to someone (In case I have kids one day).

currently I play with the thought of teaching my kids pain first if it should ever come to such a conversation and how it is conveyed effectively without being recieved as punishment.

my first thought would be to take them to boxing and throw them one or two good punches in their face right of the bat.

not for shits and giggles but to show what kind of risks are involved in a fight and if the worst case scenario in school comes up they could shrug off the pain of a well placed punch more easily (implying I hit harder than a primary-school-bully)."
Why is it that what we call some thing bullying in school but outside the schoolgrounds they would be crimes?  Knocking some kid down and stealing his lunch money is actually a robbery.  Hitting another kid is assault and battery.  Away from school, (and if you're not employed at Wal Mart) defending yourself is praised but in school you are just as guilty as the aggressor.  My kids will always be able to defend themselves. 
"My dad told me the same thing. I actually grew up fatter than the rest of the kids, so i had to defend myself a lot. I could have just walked away, but instead i choice to defend myself physically when they began throwing punches or slapping me. It ruined my entire school life as a child, i have trouble making friends in college now because of it.

Please dont enable your child to spread mindless violence. Its always better to walk away. Unless youre literally backed against a corner with no means of escape, its always better to walk away."
My aunty always told me to fucking punch them in the face if someone harassed me. I got suspended, but those kids sure as hell did NOT bother me again.
"In my school, you don't even have to defend yourself to get suspended due to what we call a ""zero tolerance"" policy. Some kid got his ass handed to him without even lifting a finger and he still got suspended for a day for being involved."
"Careful with that. I got charged with assault for it. Thankfully I was underage, but it could have marked my police record checks. They wanted to try me as an adult ""to make an example"", it was the beginning of the zero tolerance bullshit days. I won, that made me guilty... and his mom was a teacher. "
"MY Pawpaw said that if he caught me running from a fight, he'd whoop me worse than the one chasin' me would have.
I never did.
Because my cousins were like shitty big brothers, I was a freckle-faced pig-tailed brawler in the muddiest of blouses.
He also said the same thing to my Dad when he was growing up. Makes me miss Pawpaw. <3"
My karate teacher told his son that if a bully ever attacked him he should fight back for this very reason. They're both going to be suspended so he might as well teach the bully a lesson. 
"I have a deaf student who blew out her knee playing soccer and was on crutches.  

Another student called her a deaf slut and punched her in her cochlear implant, causing her to become 100% deaf (this was later fixed, thankfully).  

She was suspended for putting up her hands to block the punches.  The administrator who handed down the punishment told her she should have run away.  She was on crutches.  "
"In my auto shop class if some asshole devices to walk up and punch you in the face and you do nothing, you both get kicked out of all shops (it's the only school in the 3 surrounding districts with shops) and suspended. 

EDIT: Decides, not devices, but I'm leaving it because it's funny and relates to auto shop. "
Sounds like a great reason to fight back even harder. If that was the rule at my school, I'd fight back until I was torn off the instigator because fuck I'm suspended already right?
"Same here. In my old high school in Maryland, you'd get suspended if you got punched in the face due to ""Being a part of the conflict"". It was such bullshit. Everyone that wasn't a douche hated the rules and the admins wondered why there were bomb threats every month. I'd be happy is someone burned that place to the ground."
If there is a more mindless class of idiot than upper level public school administrators, I haven't met them.
My school is like this. I figure I might as well get my hits in if I'm suspended/recommended for expulsion anyway.
Middle school, kid walked up to me when we had a sub and blindsided me in the side of the head from behind with a cast. I spun around, which made him miss me with this next throw that caught the sub in the side. I was home for 5 days for 'hitting' a sub. The only thing I did was spin around when I got hit in the head...
"This almost happened to me. A kid cut me in the lunch line (middle school), and I half-pushed him back and told him not to ""fucking cut me"". He turned around and punched my square in the head. I was instantly pulled back and we were both sent to ISS. My principal's reasoning is ""you had to provoke him enough to make him want to hit you!""

No, I fucking didn't. The asshole was a dick and punched me."
Fucking zero tolerance policies. I've been suspended multiple times for getting my shit beat, starting a long time hatred for authority.
same here. My friend missed the last lacrosse game of his high school career because some kid punched him a few times in the face. My friend made a point not to fight back and was still suspended.
"Want to be prom king or Queen?

Hire someone to punch your competition in the face, they'll get suspended and won't be able to show up for prom.


It's the perfect crime."
Same at mine. My brother got suspended for 2 days for getting punched in the fucking face. He did not retaliate AT ALL. 
sooo that's 100% permission to deck the other kid as long as it's in self defense because the punishment occurs regardless? I can work with this
That was my high school as well. If someone hated your guts enough to throw a punch at you, you were fucked no matter what you did.
Are you me? Because that was nearly what happened to me too, except in my story, the fighter and me became best friends because he saw it was bullshit that I got suspended for fighting back.
"Well, time to sue the school.

Seriously, I wish someone would sue the school over this. That's the only possible way I can see this getting turned around, is when the courts get to declare it illegal."
"That reminds me of my first fight in 3rd grade. Some asshat ran out of the school at recess with 5 min left,   He had just got out of recess detention. He yells ""I'm gonna tackle redzaturn!"" He tackled me, and stood over me and said ""What are you gonna do now?"" So I stood up and started punching him in the face until my fists were covered in blood and a teacher pulled me off of him. This kid had been giving me trouble for a long time, so I brought that up in the principals office. At least 6 student witnesses for different events of him pushing me and shoving me into walls were reported. 3 teachers also saw him tackle me and heard him yell that he was going to. I got 4 days of out of school suspension and he got 30 minutes of recess detention. Fuck that retarded bitch of a principal. My dad picked me up from the office that day and got me a shake from Dairy Queen. That was only one of many fights I've had at school. When you fight someone Everton thinks you are acting like a tough prick, so more people want to fight you. Just one of my stories. "
This is the only reason I ever got into fights at school too. I knew as soon as the first shove or punch or whatever came my way, I was already getting in trouble, so I may as well earn it. 
"I'm usually against violence except in self defense and all, but that story just filled me with *so much joy*...

I'm not sure if Zero Tolerance policies are a thing here in the UK. We have lots of dumb rules and overly PC stuff, but at least I've never heard of being suspended for being hit. That is outrageous."
Good. Bullies are animals. They don't know right from wrong, only whether it's painful for them. Once you make it painful enough for them, they stop.
"This exact tale happened to me in fourth grade (age 10). I was so proud of my restraint to not fight my longtime bully and went immediately to the principal in tears and a swollen left eye. I was promised justice would be served but his punishment was the same slap on the wrist he received from drawing blood with his fingernails from two twins a few months earlier. My teacher's response was literally ""I didn't see it so I can't be sure he hit you."" Tell that to my black eye!"
story of my highschool days... and you can be sure, that it came to stop after seeing the principal...
">Reminds me of the American justice system 

Funny you should mention that. Zero tolerance policies are
strongly linked to the [school to prison pipeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline)"
"If you let them hit you, you still get suspended.

The best plan of action, given that getting beat up is punishable by suspensions, is to fight back or better yet, given that you are going to be suspended no matter what happens, if you feel that a fight is immanent, throw the first punch.  The one who throws the first punch is at an advantage."
They only let you stay if you let them beat you up, because they want to give you a break. If you fight back, they'd rather take their chances suspending both kids as opposed to only the wrong kid. 
That reminds you of the American justice system? You do realize we have literally the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world? Higher than apartheid south africa
Defendong sounds like a super hero that uses his giant dong to defend the streets.  That or a giant mace/dildo.  I can't decide.  
"Except letting them take a stay-home vacation (at least in Florida) nowadays means they're going to lose %2 off of every grade of theirs, unless they attend the infamous 'alternative to out-of-school suspension'. 

I've had to spend a total of upward of 30 days there. 

It's tough going to a rough school..."
If I have a kid and he's sent home for defending himself, I'll let him stay up late doing whatever he wants and have a strong talk with the school the next day.
"They're not getting punished for defending themselves. Rather, the school is just saying ""we don't know who to suspend, so we'll suspend both of them"". The kids that don't defend themselves are an exception. Because it's obvious that they were being bitches."
I never once snaw anyone even get close to fighting on my campus the entire time I was i college. Is it really that big of a problem at your school...?
Happened in my high schools. Girl was eating lunch and two girl's jumped her. One girl took her by the face and smashed head into the table. After the first two smashes her nose was bashed up. The second girl is standing behind the first girl and after the first girl throws the victim the floor, the second girl stomps on her face. The victim was in a bloody mess and most of her face is smashed up. All thee girls got suspended for a week. The victim didn't even lay a finger on anyone. Fuck zero tolerance rule . 
"Or just a cardboard box on the side of the road.

I mean, it's an interesting box. It's big, it's boxy. But COME ON PEOPLE!"
Or when it's just two police officers pulled over and having a friendly chat with each other. Yeah, I remember crawling during that traffic line. I understand not wanting to get their attention, but jesus-christ-on-a-waffle, don't slow down everyone for miles behind you!
Oh myy good!! I had this happen this summer driving across germany... Aprox 50km of barely moving traffic... 6 hours sitting in a damn car... All because some dudes engine died and everyone wanted to see it.
Also leaf-peepers in the new England area this time of year. I get so fucking pissed off at people driving stupidly slow to look at leaves.
It pisses me off too, but at the same time it causes traffic to be moving slowly past the responders, so it is good in a way.
Hahaha, I loved that game! We even got someone in a different car to actually wave at us, with there motherfucking leg!!!
"Going in the same direction, if there are people on the side working or otherwise a chance to spill into traffic, then yes, the adjacent lane should be cleared or slowed down.  

However, people on the other side of the freeway should **not** be slowing down to gawk.  "
Simple flick of the wrist can help people understand what you are doing with that 2 ton death machine. 
If I wait in traffic for 30+ minutes and only move 2 miles, I doubt that people are stopping to look at see if they need to assist the multiple fire fighters, cops, and ambulances on the other side of a divided highway. 
"My mentality is that I have spent 26 years of my life not looking at that wreck, I don't need to look at that wreck and my life will continue on fine. 

Looking at the wreck will slow down people behind me. And that annoys me. "
"Or just being all cryptic. This girl I know, who has a special needs daughter, posted ""this is the worst day of my life. I'm so upset"". after actually talking to her, thinking something really bad had happened she said that her favorite podcast was canceled. Fucking really."
"I got a ""nobody asked your opinion"" once. I pointed out that by posting it on Facebook he was inviting everyone's opinion. He was frustrated because he knew I was right."
"Here is an example of one that shouldn't biother me but does.

I have a Facebook ""friend"" who is uberdramatic.  And when she can't be dramatic about her life, she finds other lives.  Case in point: Last week in a town about 15 minutes from us, a house exploded from natural gas. A 13 year old girl died in it.  Awful.  Terrible.  I can't even imagine being her parents.  So, Dramatic Facebook Friend, who never met these people and doesn't know who they are, has taken to posting several times a day for the past week things like ""God protect our little Angel""  ""Hannah, thinking of you today as I go about my day""  She even found a pic of the deceased girl and had photoshopped quotes on the pic and posted them.

I know, we should be sad over it, but I think she is going a tad too far.  For strangers"
I just straight up unfriend people for this. After a few months of doing that, my feed is gloriously tolerable.
"I like when I subtly mentioned dealing with two funerals in a week being difficult, but then this other girl all day is ""SO DONE WITH THIS"" and is ""GOING TO KILL SOMEONE"" and hates her life and blah blah blah omg my job is annoying. Like, ok, just because I'm dealing with some shit doesn't mean you can't complain about yours, it's a public space, but when it's all you post about all day, every other status, it's kind of grating. Especially when you have ""WORST DAY EVER!!!!"" every other day"
"Honestly, what else is it for?

You say this person is a stay at home mom, she probably doesn't get out as much as she'd like. Facebook is an easy way to bullshit with her friends.

Cleaned her house? I'll give you that one. Made soup? Easy conversation with her friends. ""what kind of soup?"" ""oh that sounds good"" ""you should try this other kind of soup, i'll send you the recipe""

Boom. Social media."
"That is privileged. Spoiled is when they get tons of shit and don't appreciate it.

""Honey, we got you a laptop for your birthday.""

""THIS IS THE $550 MODEL. I WANTED THE $600 MODEL! AND THIS IS PURPLE, NOT FUCSIA. I FUCKING HATE YOU!""

That is spoiled.

""Honey, we got you a laptop for your birthday.""

""Thanks Mom and Dad. *Hugs* Wow! $550, that is a lot! Thanks again!

 This is Privileged"
The term spoiled is more aimed at those who have been ruined by what they have been given. Some rich kid with a nice lunch box can actually still be a pretty legit kid. 
"Like the kids who have a car that their parents bought them, but they aren't snobby and rude, and actually appreciate it. 

^^^yes ^^^that ^^^kid ^^^is ^^^me.  ^^^^Thanks ^^^^mom ^^^^and ^^^^dad!"
"Exactly. Everyone judges me so hard when they walk into my room and see a bunch of expensive stuff. Firstly, my dad makes me work in the restaurant he owns for that money. Secondly, my parents taught me, when I was about five years old, to appreciate what I have. They didn't teach me to appreciate it ""because I said so"" he told me ""you know how tired you were after you helped me clean the kitchen? We have to work that hard everyday, all day, so that we can give you these toys. We won't always be able to give them to you, we get tired too. Is that okay?""

Of course at the time, I just said ""yes daddy!"" and went to go play with my toys, but that kept me from being a complete brat later on."
He's not saying he's angry at the children though, it's just their existence that makes him angry, not the cause. 
It's like a race or something?! LIke they lose pride if they 'let' you pass them? Logic I will never understand
Alternatively, being two behind a slow vehicle, the vehicle in front of you moving into the passing lane, apparently to overtake, but then slowing to match slow vehicle's pace, leaving you stuck behind two slow-ass cars.  
Basically, human beings turn into awful creatures when they hop behind the wheel of a car. Kind of scary when you realize just how dangerous driving can be. 
"I'll discourage passing me on 2 occasions:

1 - There was a merge area.  You didn't use it.  Now you're trying to barrel your way in from behind me around the front of me.  No thanks sir, you can fucking wait.

2 - I'm keeping a safe distance between myself and the car in front of me at high speed.  You passing me won't get either of us there any faster because then I'll just be behind that guy *and* you.  Sorry, 20 feet behind someone at 60 miles per hour is *not* a safe distance."
"I speed up to keep people from getting in front of me because I'm trying to keep traffic flowing. I'm talking rush hour traffic. Those few assholes weaving in and out of lanes cause more traffic delays than they avoid. Everyone stay in your lane and just wait it out, it won't kill you. 

Conversely, if traffic is flowing freely and I see someone closing in behind me, I'll gladly move over so they don't have to weave around me. "
My policy on those occasions is to floor it past them, get in front and see how much I can slow down before they get pissed and overtake. At which point I speed up so they can't. Then I repeat step 2. I'm a horrible person.
I do this to people that OP was talking about. If you want to pass me and then continue to drive faster than me, no problem. If you want to pass me and then slow down in front of me so I have to pass you again, then you get to sit over in the left lane and we'll race. My car is faster, I'll win that fight. 
Whenever this happens I just imagine clipping their rear quarter panel, sending them spinning out of control.
I slow down a mile or two when someone passes, because they should be in the other lane for as short a time as possible.
When people do this I haul ass to get in front of them and slow down to the speed I was going before they sped up. 
I see this comment all the time and I would like to explain myself, being someone who someone does this. Sometimes I slow down a little without realizing, and only when someone starts to pass do I realize, so I speed up not to stop you but to match the flow of traffic. I realize it's aggravating and I'm sorry.
Not gonna lie. If I see a person being a dick and weaving in and out of traffic, I adjust my speed slightly so that they can't pass me and end up boxing themselves in between me and the car in front of them.
"Single lane freeway. Guy is going 50 until suddenly, in the presence of a passing line, he magically turns into a teenager and speeds up to 90.

Then he transforms back when the lane ends."
this one pisses me off the most, but I think it's more justifiable. I have, once or twice in my life, noticed that I wasn't doing the speed limit only when someone was passing me... and since I have no reason to drive under the speed limit, I've sped up a bit (though usually not enough to keep them from passing). oops.
"I frequently do people that drive like assholes.  fuck them.  If you want to drive 30 mph over the speed limit, do it when that's the flow of traffic or you're the only one on the road.  Not when everyone is driving 55 during rush hour.

If you're driving like a complete dick and it's not going to cause a wreck, don't bother trying to pass me.  I will box you into the travelling lane you're trying to pass in.

For the record, I don't mean people who are moving with the flow of traffic and I happen to be driving a little slower (IE everyone driving 75 and I'm doing closer to 65).  I'm talking about that guy that's doing 100 when everyone is going 65 and trying to squeeze through openings in traffic just barely large enough for their car.  You know that guy.  Fuck that guy."
This is one reason that I love my current car so much. My other car isn't very quick so if I was trying to pass someone and they got on it, there wasn't anything I could do. Not anymore, though. It's so satisfying to be able to pass anyone I please regardless of whether they want me to or not. 
"Equally people who pass you only to stop at the red light just a few meters ahead.

Hope it was worth the single car length."
I don't like single lane phobia, where the other person will do 10 below the speed limit, then when it opens up into a passing lane, they suddenly can do 5 over the limit. Back to the single lane and they get scared and do 10 under again
"And then you think that since they sped up, they realized they were going way to slow, so you slow down to drop back in line behind them, and they stay RIGHT FUCKING NEXT TO YOU UNTIL YOU MISSED YOUR FUCKING EXIT AND YOU HAVE TO CALL THE COPS TO REPORT A ROAD RAGE INCIDENT JUST SO YOU CAN GET OFF THE FUCKING HIGHWAY. 

Seriously, fuck people."
"That is actually illegal, an you can legally go 10over the speed limit to pass.
Source:drivers ed. 12th grade 2yrs ago 
:)"
For me this is totally situational. If we're in heavy traffic and the guy is just being a douche and trying to get ahead, I'm blocking him. If we're just cruising along, I don't care and will let people in.
I do this just to mess with people...like when I know they are going to speed up and squeeze in front of me, despite that there is more room behind me.
guilty of doing this when i know im already doing 7-10 over the limit. safety first, we have Amish buggies in the area 0_o
I've done this unintentionally a few times.  It was more of a didn't realize how slow I was driving until they started passing me, and then I realized that I was doing the thing.
"> people that speed up to match your speed when you're passing.

I occasionally do this, but only because I'm really self-conscious of my driving ability, and if a bunch of people pass me, I assume I'm going too slowly, so I speed up so I'm not inconveniencing other drivers. It takes me a few seconds to realize that by speeding up, I'm actually frustrating the guy trying to pass, so I slow back down, and then the whole thing just repeats."
Im that guy sometimes and its not to spite you, its just that I didnt realize hiw slow I was going and you passing me alerted me so I speed up. Sorry :(
I do something like this all the time to people that are being obvious douchebags on the highway. If they are doing 80 in a giant yellow hummer on a 65 mph road, ill speed up so they cant pass and then match speed when I'm parallel with another vehicle. Road block bitch (rbb for short).
I do this if people try to use the douchebag lane to pass me. I'll speed up and force them to hit the brakes and get behind me again. That's not what that lane is for, asshole!
I went to Houston this weekend and HOLY FUCK do people drive like crazy insane people there. They are not afraid to honk and I almost got hit by a car twice.
I got a friend who recently moved from Texas. He sways through traffic and goes like 90 just to pass a Camry. I guess this is why.
It's like we are trying to race each other to wherever the fuck we're going. It's annoying, sometimes I just wanna cruise on the highway, but no, we have to go ~85 no matter what just to not be a hazard.
"Fucking this. D/FW drivers are the worst about this type of thing. You've got some got in his brotruck passing you, then he gets a text and slows way the fuck down, suddenly you're going 40 in a 65, you try to pass, but notice that every other driver is also driving with two thumbs up their asses. You could change lanes, but you wouldn't get far, wouldn't be able to pass, and you're already in the lane you need to be in, so your stuck behind Brotruck for another mile. On the off chance you can see around this wanna be monster truck, you'll notice that there is nothing slowing this inbred SOB down, he's just getting skull fucked by his own bullshit. Holy shit, rant. Seriously though,trying to drive through the metroplex at 5 pm in less than an hour is like trying to get a cold drink in hell; that shit just ain't happening.  "
"In Texas, they like to speed up to pretend they're going to pass someone (usually a semi) and then slow down to match their speed, basically trapping you.

WHY?!"
As an ambulance driver,  ironically in Texas, I stand behind this one.   However,  when driving said piece of shit ambulance and noticing how the cruise control can behave,  I think the cause of a lot of these scenarios is people's crappy cruise controls (i.e.  Waiting until you're at the top of a hill then cruise finally kicks in and guns the engine.) 
This happens all the time in every mountainous state I've ever lived in. Drives me insane. Sometimes it's a horse trailer or something, and you can literally see the huge cloud of black smoke from when the driver up front punches it at the beginning of the passing late. wtf. 
On the east coast we have no problems flashing our brights in their mirrors, or even honking if appropriate. 
"Not all cars have cruise control or smooth acceleration. Just keep that in mind; especially older cars.

My 1999 honda I used to own and my current 2000 mitsibushi both don't have cruise control. Unlike acceleration in newer cars, I really have to push on the pedal to get the speed to change. This makes it hard to keep a steady speed. I've driven my parent's newer car a couple times, and that thing accelerates like a dream.

Sorry if you've ever been stuck driving behind someone like me..."
Not really, we like our passing lane open and moving fast. It's usually PA drivers that seem to think 50 is acceptable to do in the passing lane.
"Do you what I really find funny?

I'm going a steady 60 in a 55 on a one lane highway. Somebody tailgates me real bad, and then *finally* passes me. I catch up to them in 5 minutes in the next town after they have to slow down for the lowered speed limit.

Makes me laugh every time that they got so worked up over my speed only to catch right up to them again. Impatient bastards."
This morning not as bad as the afternoon. Since it started to drizzle this afternoon, people decided to go under the speed limit. It was so much fun. 
People like to stereotype aggressive/inattentive driving by state when in reality, it's likely not a people by area problem, but a network by area problem.
You would think that after living in New England for the last 5 years (Massachusetts - 1, Maine - 4), I would be used to it. 
If you're girlfriend's passing people like this on the highway, you should tell her to stop for her own safety. This kind of behavior might seriously piss off the wrong person on the road.
How about taking selfies during a movie? It's happened to me twice, people pulling out their fucking camera phones with flash to blind everyone in a two-seat radius.
"I'm the same as you. I spoke up once and the young girl said, ""Seriously?"" And rolled her eyes dramatically. I didn't say anything further but I think I will be more firm next time.  It's becoming a problem and it's not okay. If I sit by and do nothing I'm implicitly giving my permission.  Well that's what it feels like. "
"First time I experienced this was a couple of years back at Sundance. I mean, it's freaking Sundance. The filmmakers are there in the audience, and you're going to text during the show? I asked the guy to put it away.

""Really?"" he said.

""Yeah, really.""

He left the screening to continue to text."
Especially when they have phones with physical keypads, then you get the annoying light PLUS the click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click-clickity-click-click-click-clickity-click.
"**Get a refund.**

Theaters will do nothing about this if you keep paying. Ask the person to stop, if they don't, after the movie complain to management and ask for a refund.

If they don't give it to you, let them know immediately the next time while the movie is running. In that case, since you didn't get the thing you paid for, dispute the charge. (Always use a credit card if you want power as a consumer. Not debit, credit.)"
I once threw popcorn at a teenager who was texting in the theatre. Needless to say I felt like a bonafide badass.
I once saw a guy sat behind a particularly egregious repeat offender (who had a sound playing on EVERY keypress!) stand up, reach over them, grab the phone and hurl it at the cinema wall.  A sizeable portion of the cinema audience clapped. It was glorious.
I would try to get them to stop by kindly asking if they could put their phone away or step outside and finish texting. But I will only do this if the person is constantly texting. I wouldn't mind if they had to check their phone quickly before getting back to the movie. 
One of my proudest moments is grabbing a guys phone from his hand and throwing it across the theater. I had asked him twice to put it away. Fuck him.
"I was behind a guy I knew at the movies and he kept texting, so I started throwing popcorn at his screen. When he turned around to say something I just went ""man, there are so many fucking moths in this theater, they keep diving at your bright ass phone""."
You can also tear up your ticket and flick small balls of paper in their hair. Like lots of it. Doesn't do much, but can be satisfying.
If the brightness is turned all the way down and the phone is silent I don't see why that would be an issue. It's not bothering anyone and if it's a movie I'm not to invested in and I just went because my friends wanted to see it then I'm guilty of it as well. 
I don't like your use of a double negative and am still somewhat confused as to whether it was used correctly or not. 
Fuck me mate. $25 for a bloody 3D movie!! What part of Australia do you live in? In Melbourne it's about $20 when you buy the 3D glasses too.
Where on earth are you going to the movies? I'm 19 and a 3D ticket costs like $17, which is still pretty high, but $25!? 
I went and saw Gravity last week and the audience was terrible, there was a group of teens sitting near the front that kept talking and pulling their phones out. A guy sitting near them actually got up and told them to shut up or leave. A woman decided to sit right next to me, there were plenty of other seats available, and proceeded to talk through the movie. At the end she started freaking out and yelling at Sandra to take her suit off, and that was after she finished eating her popcorn all through the silent parts of the movie...
"I went to a late showing of a movie with my boyfriend, we always sit in the back row that way no one sits behind us kicking our chairs. After the movie ended the guy sitting in front of us actually thanked us for being such good movie goers because he goes to movies as a hobby and normally has people kicking his chair or being loud during the movie.

We go to a lot of movies, so we have a lot of practice being good audience members, but I've never been thanked for it."
Before I stopped going to the theater this happened to me too often. I'd try to go at an off-the-wall time to try to catch the movie in a mostly empty theater and the second the lights went out it seemed someone very tall would sit directly in front of me (I'm short)....with 75%+ of the theater empty. About a third of the time, the person would whip out their cell phone during the movie as well.
If it's kept at a whisper and not going on constantly, it's forgive-able since the sound tends to be loud and I'm barely going to hear you. Now if it's constant or above a whisper, I'm throwing the person looks that could kill.
For the uninitiated, [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L3eeC2lJZs) is the type of warning message that is played before each movie at The Alamo Drafthouse. I refuse to see a movie anywhere else now.
Last week, I took the city metro and you have to walk through a small hallway which leads to the underground. Two teenager morons decided to suddenly stop and have a conversation right there! I had no choice but to push them away because I had many dozens of people behind me. It was either shoving away two morons or everyone else falling and piling up.
This is my wife's family.  Some people congregate in the kitchen, no, my wife's lot like to hang around in the hallway and doorways.  Kinda frustrating.
"""Oh, hey. How you doing? I haven't seen you in so long!!!.  Let's stand right here in door way catching up while everyone is trying to get by!"" "
Or people who stand on the wrong side of a swinging door. I opened a door and almost hit a girl and I apologized but then she said that I should be knocking when coming through doors. What? It's my fault you don't have common sense enough to not stand in front of an exit? 
"At work, people love standing in the doorway.  I know the door is made of glass but saying oh sorry doesn't change the fact thats its priority is to be a door first, not a fucking window to stare out of while you talk on the phone.

I am more disgusted when its a fat man and he doesn't even try to move out of the way even after saying excuse me. "
"This is a great way to turn people who would politely move out of your way if you asked into belligerent assholes. 

Pretty sure my first reaction would be to square my shoulders and slow right the fuck down."
"While this is brilliant, I fucking hate when you have people that get extremely belligerent because you called them on their shit. 

Standing in the middle of the hall? Get out of my way.

DA FUCK YOU JUST SAY TO ME LIL BITCH

I just made myself mad writing this up. I need to make a post here..."
I wish I could do this, but I am rather short and quite thin. I would be less train and more that one random leaf that gets stuck to your windshield...
"""ouchoo-choo my way""

"this is even better when you tent your hands and point them forward, elbows out.

this train's got a motherfucking cattle guard, bitches."
So you just me to fuck a bunch of people standing in the middle of a hallway? That might be rape don't ya think?
Pro tip: always walk in the oncoming lane and look past them, that way people see you coming and get out of the way early. 
Train? HAH! I'm a fucking god damn T-Rex retrofitted with shoulder-pads made of sharks with lasers and saws for teeth, while my feet are delicately placed on the back of charging hippos. 
Unfortunately the campus I'm on when this happens is in the city and primarily black. I might be shot/beat to death if I did this.
Im 6 foot 5 around 280 pounds. When I was in highschool, if you were standing in my way and I had to ask you more than once to move, you were getting knocked the fuck over. 
That's what I had to do to get into ANY of my classes in Highschool.  Just storm through the crowds of midgets(I was 5'11 in 9th grade, most of the 10-11th graders were several inches shorter than me).
"I did this once, though it was 4 asians walking abreast blocking the entire hallway with their slow walking. I said, what I thought was in my head, ""What the fuck is this? the Great Wall of china?""  They instantly stopped and turned around, when I realized ""Oh fuck they're Koreans,"" and darted down a nearby stairwell."
"I was at a mostly empty crosswalk in downtown Ottawa last week going to work.

Signal turns white to walk, so I begin to cross. Some uptight bitch of a public servant (I am one as well) launches herself off the curb and lands in my path. The crosswalk is about 5+ meters wide and empty. After landing in front of me she begins to go 60% my walking pace. I almost run her down. I am not a big man, but she is still tinier. I am wearing headphones. As I barely stop short of body-checking the woman into the ground from behind I mutter bitch under my breath. ""Bitch"".

Anyone who has tried speaking while wearing headphones is sure to know that it is difficult to gauge how loud your voice is in that scenario. 

What was supposed to be only a barely-mouthed insult turned into a guttural declaration of ""Bitch"" probably heard even by the people crossing from the other side of the four lane road. The woman stopped and turned around in place, causing me to almost fall over her again, and of course had that pouty awestruck look on her face. Of course I am now the villain. She likely said something stupid or inane like ""What?!"". Woman, you just jumped off the curb on a non-90 degree angle on an empty cross walk. 

Luckily, I did not hear whatever she said. I barely realized what I had done because I was still jamming to my music. I stepped aside and continued on my route to work. Hopefully I ruined her day though by inadvertently calling her on her bullshit. "
"I've always wondered:  what if I act like a crazy person to get things done in public?  Just yell, ""GORILLA SANDWICHES!!!"" while waving your arms around like crazy, and people will move out of your way."
"while trying to navigate through a crowd, my friend loves to take point position and shout, ""watch out, my friend's gonna puke!"".  he says it makes him feel like moses parting the red sea."
"""When I grow up I want to be fat and in everyone's way."" Every time I'm forced to go to a mall for something I'm stuck behind a group of behemoths lumbering side by side with at least one stroller full of kids learning to be flesh blockades."
"A couple years ago in school, my class was on the second floor at the very back of the building. So when I wanted to get to the buses quickly, I had to walk fast. Every day there were atleast ten people holding up everybody. I was the short kid and couldn't really do anything either. 

You could put three cars between them and the group of people in front of them."
Fellow fast walker. I've never not been pissed off in an airport. Slow walking assholes who take up the space of 2.5 people because the don't know how to roll their god damn luggage behind them. 
"I remember this happening one time I was walking around NYC with my friend and her parents.  We were going through a crosswalk and her mother stopped to tie her shoes.  Right in the middle of a crosswalk, she bent down and tied her shoes. I was directly behind her as she did this and we were moving fast enough that I flipped completely over her and flattened onto the street. 

We laughed at her for that for quite a few years. "
Bonus points for coming to a dead stop in the middle of a flight of stairs to look at your phone or respond to a text.
"I make a point to say something each time that happens to me.  I don't care that person hates me, they were going to hate be otherwise.  

But at least now someone has told them the truth, they stopped randomly without warning and this happened.  At least now they are aware. "
This just happen to me... I was walking briskly and this woman suddenly stops to pick up a penny I wanted to kick her.
Im convinced people *are* cattle. People just wandering aimlessly into the streets and shit... Go fucking die.
"Lean in close when they're not paying attention, and abruptly say, ""Scuse me! Sorry!""

Done correctly, they get snapped back to reality unpleasantly, you take advantage of the split second their guard is down to navigate around then before they can block you if that's what they decided to try and do, but you maintain plausible deniability that you were being polite. Win win!"
It's so true. Walmart is slow-walker's heaven, and they drive even more slowly than they walk in the parking lot.
"That happened to me once in high school too. Four or five girls in a hallway, arm linked, walking slowly. My friend went to the wall and squeezed passed them. I walked right through them and broke the chain. Their response was ""Oh my god, how rude."""
"She probably needs people to talk to her...This is something people who are trying to get together in college did...Go to a girl you are trying to ""keep in line"" and ask her to call him in to morning to study...yeah...didn't make a lot of sense to me too... "
"I have an aunt like this. No college education, No job, No career skills. She is a baby factory that has already pumped out 6 with no end in sight. She takes pride in the fact that she does not have to help out with the bills. Her husband makes less than 15K a year... and he is proud of the work he does.

His job is convincing naive relatives and coworkers to give him money that he in turn invests into pathetic business ventures of other people. He lost all my grandparents retirement fund and never batted an eye. Same thing with his sisters money. He is proud of his work."
I definitely thought you were talking about my friend that I work with until you said husband and 40.
My mother-in-law does this and it fills me with such a passionate hate. You know how when you're eating with someone and they ask you a question but you have a mouthful of food so you take your time to finish chewing before answering? Yeah, no. She will actually take a bite of food (let's say salad) and continue talking with her cheeks literally full of food. You can see pieces of lettuce in her cheeks while she's talking. It's disgusting.
And then they talk whilst eating, finding it funny when food falls out of their mouth... * shudders *
People who are proud of not reading. My brother is one of these people. Okay, fine, you don't read. Don't boast about it when your girlfriend and I are recommending books to one another like it's some sort of badge of honour!
"I'm guilty of things like this occasionally. Just see it from my perspective.

I don't read novels. I'm boring. I tend to read textbooks. It's not that I'm uneducated or stupid, it's just that I don't like to read novels that much.

So, when I'm with people who are steering the subject towards their favorite novels, I make fun of myself to hint to the others that they're moving into a subject I can't talk about. Y'know, social signals and all that.

It's not that I'm proud of being stupid, it's that I can't or don't want to have a conversation about it, and I'm trying to tell you that in the least inane way possible."
"No it's not, get over yourself. You still can be leading in a field and don't know how to browse without downloading  toolbars every 3 clicks. 

Or in the spirit of this thread: People that are so small minded that they can't even comprehend the fact that for other people a different set of rules applies. "
This drives me crazy. People in their 30's who are proudly computer illiterate and expect me so fill the employment application out for them. I'm sorry, I don't have an hour to dedicate to your stubbornness. How do people get along in today's world not knowing and unwilling to know how to even use an ATM?
The following story must be a version of this: I know someone who proudly declared that they've learned how to work in Windows Defragmenter. 
That doesn't sound like being proud.  That sounds like someone laughing at themselves because they don't understand technology.  
"Not really, lack of competency with a computer may just mean that said person enjoys spending their time on things that aren't ""screen"" dependent.
         More and more jobs today require computer competency, so I get it that those who do not pick up the skill must seem like neanderthals to those whose livelihood is based upon being a computer wizard. 

In a time when work and play are both done on tablets, smartphones, and computers, to claim to be computer illiterate may be one individual taking a stand on what constitutes the skills they wish to build their life around. That proudness may be an attempt to weed out people who do love computers and enjoy recreating/working with them, and instead find like minded people who enjoy other things like going outside, art, reading, writing, music, playing with dogs, sucking on boobs.

Not that you can't do those things on a computer"
As a maths teacher, it's always bothered me that people are so prepared to say 'oh man, I am so bad at maths!' like it's something to be proud of. You wouldn't admit to being bad at reading so readily.
"I work in cellphones, so I hear this every day. I always think ""So... you're just regular illiterate."""
Oh god, I have to blast music in my headphones every morning to avoid murdering my roommate for this. Good thing I never wanted to go to Asia. 
I think you're thinking of slurping? This only applies to noodles when the cook is present (supposed to be to let the cook know you thought the food was good)
Which part? I have to make sure I never travel there with my hubby, he will lose his mind. Please, help me help him. Thanks!
worked at a hibachi restaurant, witnessed a small Asian girl throw a super hot bowl of soup across a hibachi table at my friend as he was pointing and laughing slapping his lips together 
No, I think there's a difference between stupidity and deliberate ignorance. If someone is stupid, It's not necessarily their fault because they may not have been given the chance to actually learn anything. Deliberate ignorance is being given to chance to actually learn something, but choose to stay ignorant by not listening or trying. 
"It is broad and general, I understand this.

I.e. You're a doctor.  Patient X is telling you all about this problem they have.  You speak about a way to avoid such outcomes.  Patient X is open and honest about lifestyle choices.  You offer direct correlation information why said lifestyle is causing this outcome.  Patient X ignores this information and continues to live that lifestyle.


This is playing the dramatics card; however, it is the best description I have."
Same sort of deal with a now ex-friend of mine. We make plans to meet up for a girls' night in with pizza and movies. The time she's supposed to have arrived at my apartment comes and goes....half hour later comes and I text her that I will go ahead and order the food. She texts me back that's okay and she'll be there soon. Food arrives approx 45 mins after this. I place the boxes of pizza in the oven and text her again that the food's here....no response so I figure she's on her way. Somewhere around 20-30 minutes later I start eating and text her to see what's wrong....no response. An hour goes by, I text her yet again....no response. Another hour later I finally get a text something came up and she won't be by. The something that came up was her ex-boyfriend showing up and wanting to go out a little after I texted about ordering food. She never got why I was pissed..
I hate when you are working out, or in a lecture when they tell you only five more minutes, or we will get out early today. Ten minutes later and out right on time makes me want to punch them in the face.
Me too. Showing up late without having a good reason goes to show that the other person has no respect for your time or you. 
I sat next to a girl in one class that would read the PowerPoint slides out loud as our professor lectured. That was quite possibly the longest 3 hours of my life. 
Some people can't help it.  They're naturally active listeners.  Its like talking with your hands, you can't stop it unless your actively trying to and focusing on that task.
"I wish class sizes were smaller for this reason so people could actually be engaged with their professors.
"
Sometimes I start to do this, and then catch myself, and then beat myself repeatedly over the head until I stop.
"Or when they have to take whatever the teacher is talking about, and relate it back to them somehow. And let everyone know about it. 

Or say something that's completely unnecessary. While the teacher is trying to lecture. "
Or the joker. Its not high school, you're wasting our money. And the fucker who laughs for 10 minutes every time then prof male a clever comment.
I remember those non traditional (middle aged, in this case) students, with their rolling backpacks, awkward fitting baseball caps and generic tennis shoes.. strolling into their front-of-the-room seat, only to strike up a convo with the middle aged professor regarding something only they, at their age, could relate to while all the 20-something college kids giggled among themselves...le sigh...those were the days...
"At my first ""real"" job, this has happened so many times in meetings...and they're adults. Blew my mind!"
You are much nicer than I am. I would have told him no the first time he said anything about it and warned him of the repercussions. If he did it anyway? Bye! I'd kick him out.
that's just so fucking obnoxious. that's even worse that he unknowingly made her feel so uncomfortable, and she still agreed to marry him. you should know your future bride a little bit more than that.
"I was proposed to on Thanksgiving. I am an extremely shy and private person, so I didn't even know what to do. Apparently, he did it because all of his family was there, and he didn't know how much longer his great grandmother was going to be around. It was awkward as hell. I didn't know how to say no in front of everyone, so I ended up saying yes. We broke up not long after that.
TL;DR Know the person you're proposing to."
"You should always propose the proposal before proposing.

""Will you let me ask you to marry me?""

It does not require a ring."
"I feel like I would decline even the most serious partner if they did it in public without discussing it with me prior, à la ""we've already discussed getting married, so I was wondering if it was alright to pop the question officially in public or in a theatrical way."" I don't mind the surprise as long as I can be prepared for it and we both know that it's a ""yes.""

It feels like such a hostage situation –– I would rather look like a heartless asshole than feel pressured to say ""yes"" just because I'm being asked to play out some set-up so that my partner can look super romantic for some YouTube video."
"Why are you no longer friends with this person? Yeah it's pretty inconsiderate, but it doesn't strike me as friendship-ending in magnitude. Is there more to why you don't speak to him?

Do I just underestimate how big a deal people feel this is?"
I had a friend get married. One of his best men had a Polish girlfriend. When they got to the Hotel for the reception she went off to get changed and came down for the wedding breakfast in a long, flowing **white** dress.
"I had people announce they were engaged at my wedding. Not exactly the same, but still pretty lame. 

""Oh let's look at your ring instead of the beautiful bride that spent all morning getting done up for their once in a lifetime day."""
I had actually been married for several months before my sister's wedding, but the first time I saw any of my family since then was at the actual wedding. Didn't tell them until the next time I was in town, which was another few months later.
I was at a wedding recently where one of the guests actually had a wardrobe change for the reception.  One slutty dress for the ceremony and a second even sluttier dress for the reception.  The only reason she was even invited to the wedding was because her bf was a groomsman; the bride hated her.
"I can see why people would be upset about it, and thus I would never do such a thing, but if it were to happen on my wedding I wouldn't mind it that much, at best it's just more reason to celebrate, at worst I/we am/are not on the attention-pedestal alone for that day.

since I am neutral on this, I guess my wife would be the shifting factor for that matter then.


just as I were typing this I wondered:

what if all the couples were to propose to each other on my wedding?

I would probably be pissed off on many levels.

gotta rethink my stance maybe. edits on this post might follow."
My dad proposed to my mum at his sister's wedding when he was drunk. Divorced a year later. Stand-up guy. 
Your daughter should divorce her spouse, and then they should patch things up and re-propose at your sons wedding
See, I think that's more of a personal preference. I would love a public proposal (and my bf knows it). Then again, I know without a doubt that I will say yes and that I want to share my happiness with the rest of the world. Bonus points if a lot of my close friends are there. Just, make your own special day, don't steal someone else's.
i agree.  unless the SO is ok with a public proposal, do something in private.  Just seems tacky to have a very public proposal.  i used to work at Disney and i would see/hear tons of very public proposals in front of the castle. overdone and so many more romantic spots (at disney/ even with the castle) that will have less random guests in the proposal photo.
Some people like it! As long as both people are okay with it and talk about it ahead of time I see no issue. (and they do it at an appropriate place/time)
I always thought I'd like a public proposal, then I got a private one, and ever since actually experiencing it I've increasingly felt like we made the right decision
"It's not so bad. I was proposed to at dinner at a nice restaurant. Now he didn't draw it out or anything, just after we finished he mentioned ordering dessert and after the waitress left he handed me the ring box. I opened it, said yes, put it on, and enjoyed our dessert....which the waitress noticed from a distance what had happened and comped our dessert, which was extremely nice of her. I'm sure the people seated at tables right next to us noticed, but it was a fairly quiet ordeal. 

Edit: Wording."
"> Propose in private! 

My wife and I were dining in a high class restaurant one night when a couple at another table got engaged. They were fairly discrete about it but many of us there noticed when he slipped out of his seat to go down on one knee. 

The entire room gave the happy couple a round of applause from everyone when she accepted, and I'm pretty sure the Maitre'd  gave them a bottle of champagne on the house. 

I think this is doing it right. 

For an example of doing it wrong, [see this.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtPkxzHKLpk)"
"The same can be said about weddings. They are very expensive and not that great. At all. People USED to be wed before their family and closest friends, not everyone they know and all their ancestors. And the religious official and contracts/filing paperwork, that's all completely new.
It's like society wants couples to put on a show for everyone else instead of focus on their own personal bonds."
"I have let it be known that I would literally walk up between them, say, ""no, this isn't happening"" pick him up off his knee, and ask him to leave. If he puts up a fight, I have more than enough guy friends to help him find the door. Or worse. I'll sick my sister (and future MOH) on him. She can be downright scary when she needs to be. :D"
"I like the way you think. :)
Or announce you're planning on renewing your vows. Bonus points if you tell the bride something along the lines of ""your wedding is so beautiful. We'll be looking at your wedding pics because I am DEFINITELY going to use these flowers. The color scheme is perfect too!"" Threatening to ""steal"" the bride's wedding should actively piss her off. :)"
Actually Scumbag Steve was the first time I heard of it happening. I've never had such an instant reaction before to something that seems so mundane to a lot of people (although judging by the responses I've gotten on here, more people agree with me than I would have thought!)
"I know. Honestly, we plan on doing it as cheaply as we can while still being nice. The big thing is, we want to take a long honeymoon. That's what we're really saving up for! :)

And I feel he and I are almost ready. And I know he's smart enough to not propose until he is completely ready. We talk about it fairly regularly, along with things we'd like to have accomplished before marriage. Ex. I want my debt paid off before the wedding. It's my debt. Not our debt. I plan on keeping it that way."

She definitely deserves sister of the year award! What great thinking! Good thing he talked to you two about it ahead of time. :D
Yeah. That makes sense. I can understand how/why others would find it kinda cool, and I know people get swept up in the magic and love of weddings. It's just something that bothers me. Weirdly enough I've had this talk with my bf already and he is ok with my reaction. He feels t's rude too, though would probably let it slide, but if needed, he'll back me up on this. :)
"I kind of agree with you in that I wouldn't mind so much. I'm not a super chill gal or anything, but I have a huge close family that doesn't get together much outside of weddings, so I kind of see it. 

The only thing that comes to mind is that I would feel really bad for the person being proposed to. For the rest of their time together, their proposal story will be at my wedding. Judging from this thread, most people will be silently horrified at the breach of etiquette instead of appreciating the romance of the story.  "
Haha I'm usually not very serious. This topic just brings it out of me. :) and I more meant the relationship was serious. Sorry for the confusion.
You're completely stealing the Bride and Grooms thunder. This is the day they have waited for their entire lives and will remember for The rest of their lives. The day they celebrate how much they love each other and their willingness and eagerness to spend the rest of their lives together. A day they spent thousands of dollars on (most probably) to be all about them an their love. Then all of a sudden a younger couple ruins it by taking the spotlight away. Especially if it is a close family member. That makes it worse not better. It's like you're the star of the play, you've rehearsed, you've put a lot of work into this. You're dressed extra special, covered in makeup and hair spray looking more glamorous than you ever have before. Then all of a sudden, someone jumps up out of the audience and sings your big solo for you. Wouldn't you be upset?
Because its a day that the bride and groom have planned and spent a lot of time/money on to be the way they want, and if someone proposes in the middle of it, that's going to be the only thing people care about/talk about. A wedding should be about celebrating the commitment the bride and groom are making to each other, not someone else's proposal. 
"Is commenting on appearance in general a bad thing even when it's positive? I try to make an effort to point out things about my coworkers that I like. Hey, Sarah, that's a nice dress. Hi John, I love those new glasses. Good morning Nancy, did you get your hair cut? It looks great.

People seem to appreciate that. But I do try to stick with ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all""."
"I worked at a nursing home in the dining room when I was younger. I worked with this short Italian girl. I noticed that old people have no filter in the same way that kids will say anything. The old people kept asking her what was wrong with her eyes. She finally broke down and said ""I am just italian"" before running out of the room."
"My boss does this all the time. ""You look tired."" Thanks jerk, for letting me know that I have serious puffy bags under my eyes which I glared at in the mirror and then tried to cover up with concealer this morning. I hadn't noticed. "
"I remember a long time ago someone commented on a video on youtube saying ""you look tired you should get some sleep"" 
I responded to that comment saying that it is slightly rude to tell someone they look tired. I got death threats... and I was called a nazi, a pussy, and I am everything that is wrong with the world. I don't get youtube comments....at all. "
Seriously!   I've had people ask me if I've been punched in the face before.   No, asshole, I just have really big bags under my eyes some mornings.
"somehow I feel like ""people that point out that the screen of my phone is broken/had seen better days"" is appropriate here.

it does not irritate me at all when people do it, but I am fully aware that my phone has a broken screen, no need to state the obvious, it's redundant."
One of my boyfriend's coworkers told him he looked fatter yesterday. Who does that? Really, how can someone think that's an ok thing to say in casual conversation?
I've been cursed with moles on my face, and I don't think I've met a person who hasn't loudly pointed them out. Pisses me off.
Don't go to Spain or any Latin-American country...it's the culture there to be frank if someone looks sick or unwell or didn't put on their makeup well that day. 
If someone doesn't wear makeup I usually point out how they look better without it. Just personally prefer it when people look like people.
"I think it would piss me off less if she suggested ways I could perhaps not have that giant zit on my chin. But no, just ""I made an observation!"" Oh, thanks. What do you expect me to say?"
Same here, every year in middle school some asshole kid drew me with a bunch of exaggerated pockmarks and zits. Ever since then I have like a genuine phobia of being drawn by anyone.
People that point out fixable things like that(mustard on your cheek, etc.) are nice. People that tell you that you have a mole are not.
A little, I don't want to be reminded that I have a pimple, I know they are there, I would prefer other people to pretend they aren't. 
"It makes you look like you value them on their appearance, rather than their personality.

They know it's there, and they're usually going to be uncomfortable and embarrassed about it. You telling them it needs to be popped will add to their embarrassment, and it's kind of patronising.

And it'll make them feel worse about their appearance in general; it makes them think they don't look good. And that may be true, but who wants to be reminded of that, especially by friends? They're probably trying hard to look OK in other aspects (clothing, hair, etc.), and being reminded that they don't look OK regardless of their efforts can take a chunk out of their confidence.

As their friend, they might appreciate it more if you don't talk about their pimples, but rather compliment them about another aspect of their appearance every once in a while."
If you did that to me I probably wouldn't want to be your friend. Pimples are nothing to be proud of and reminding them that people can see it is pretty rude and annoying. 
I would actually prefer this. I only look in the mirror twice a day, when I brush my teeth(morning and night). I hate when I notice a massive pimple at the end of the day, I walked around all day with it and no one told me so I could fix it. 
No, you're not being an asshole, don't listen to those other two guys. Pimples can go from small red dots to bulging white heads in a matter of hours, and if someone hasn't checked their face in those couple hours, then telling them is just a heads up. I would appreciate someone who lets me know I have a nasty ass pimple that needs to go. Theres a good chance that person doesn't know it. 
Hell no! you're a good friend. I hate walking around with a big ass white head and no one bothered to tell me I need to take care of it. Same with being smelly or having bad breath. Someone needs to tell me this stuff so I can take care of it.

I typically travel between two cities in my state a few times per week and there is never a shortage of this guy...
"Learn to trick them psychologically.  Most people feel threatened about the lane ahead of them being taken if they see you trying to put pressure on it and inching up on the guy in front of you.  They will increase their speed to make sure you can't get over into the next lane.  

It works almost every time when the situation presents its self, but if you back off and look uninterested in trying to get ahead.  The car in the next lane will back off feeling like no one is going to pass them.  Then bam, downshift or hit the gas, and go for the new wide opening to pass them that they will never have a chance to react too.  I always wonder how confused they must be every time i pull this on them. "
You're probably one of the guys driving in the left lane causing traffic by not moving to the right. I don't care if you are already 5-10 mph over the speed limit; that's still not fast enough for me and I need to get around you. Please move over to the right and get out of everyone's way. Because you are being inconsiderate by remaining in the left lane and forcing everyone else to travel at your speed, I will first drive up to you and wait patiently until you move out of my way. If you remain in front of me in the left lane without moving over or fail to speed up to pass the car to your right, I will proceed to honk, tailgate, and blow my horn at you so that you will get out of the left lane and out of everyone's way.

**EDIT** - I'd like to add ""anyone that thinks established science is an opinion"". Someone I've known for years was confused by [this GIF](http://boingboing.net/2013/05/20/optical-illusion-train-moves.html) and how it works. She was very adamant that it was a trick somehow.

I was able to open it in Image Ready and showed her that the first and third frames were almost the same (as were the second and fourth ones). And that the red doors in the image are roughly in the same place in the frames mentioned. So it's basically a two-frame animation and YOU decide which way it's going (either your brain and involuntary eye and head movements register it moving one way or you track the red doors with your eyes and can control the motion). I also reminded her that she used to live in London, that's where we met, so her brain is already able to make assumptions about the Tube train based on what she personally has experienced. That's what the brain does.

She wasn't ""convinced"" that was right. 

So I posted a few other optical illusions. [There is no different blue or green in this swirly image](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2009/06/24/the-blue-and-the-green/#.UmaB1HCsiSo) was one. [A still image can use tricks to make you think parts are moving because your brain fills in the gaps](http://i.imgur.com/hmiL30z.jpg) was another.

All this was just my ""opinion"" and I was apparently ""wrong"", but the lack of ""a right answer"" was beginning to piss her off so she wasn't going to debate it anymore.

I told her science isn't opinion. She unfriended me (I don't think anyone has ever called her out on being wrong before because she's a pretty ""my way or the highway"" person, but as a man of reason I wasn't going to let it slide). It doesn't matter how much I like her as a person or what past we've had, a small part of me hopes she carries this non-puzzle of hers to the grave and it's the last thing she thinks of just before fading to black. If she had typed one more ""science is just your opinion"" comment, I'd have unfriended her."

I'm pretty sure everyone has known that comeback since kindergarten, it wont be wooshing over too many heads.  (Also, it has pretty poor execution being it could also be interperated to you calling them human which is not an insult).
With the most obvious example being the flu virus constantly evolving, I don't understand why anyone questions evolution anymore.
The 'theory' part is the mechanism that drives evolution (random mutation and survival of the fittest). There is no debate among serious scientists as to WHETHER evolution happened. There's overwhelming evidence that it has.
"Ugh okay my mother said this to me yesterday. I explained to her colloquial ""theory"" meant ""hypothesis"" in the world of science, and she said these exact words:

""Okay then, so evolution is a hypothesis.""

Wat"
"Related is the belief that theories eventually get promoted to laws. 

I mean, what are they expecting, some sort of promotion ceremony with the theory kneeling before the [1927 Solvay Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvay_Conference#Fifth_Conference) or something?"
I would say generally people misusing science to justify a faith position against the currently prevalent scientific consensus.
"A good response is ""Just like the germ theory and the gravity theory. Have fun not taking medicine and flying around!"""
"My usual response:

""They also call it the 'theory of gravity,' but I don't see you trying to jump off of buildings, do I?"""
Honestly, the part that gets me is that people treat evolution as fact because they refuse to believe in a God, and that is the next best option.
people did not evolve from monkeys, we evolved from a common ancestor. Much like zebras and horses, one didnt come from the other, they came from common roots. 
"> Okay that argument sounds stupid as hell, but I don't know why.

To be honest, I don't think anyone here thinks it is a stupid question.  However, it so commonly comes from people who are willfully ignorant  and who will refuse to listen to any explanation about it since they already hold a dogmatic belief to the contrary, and not those, like yourself, who are genuinely curious.

"Well, there is the matter that we have all been already taught evolution in school, so i honestly shouldn't have reteach anyone. If you learned evolution and you still choose to deny that it's untrue, it's not a matter of improper education, it's a matter of self imposed ignorance. And yes, self imposed ignorance makes me fucking angry. Lots of things in this world would be drastically improved by people willing to accept facts, rather than choosing their own personal bias. 

Furthermore, i didn't reach this position overnight. I tried your method the first several times i encountered these types of people and no amount of proof or reasoning would change their minds. The don't believe in evolution and have no intention on changing that. "
"The thing is, a lot of these people, especially extremely religious ones, refuse to be taught about evolution.

Other way around in most countries.  In Australia for example, it's very difficult to adopt, even though there are so many kids that could be adopted, and so many couples that want to adopt.

Parents who think their kid is to precious to get head lice and won't treat them for it.  Those assholes keep infecting the other kids.  I had to treat my 6 year old four times last year because someone in her kindergarten class kept spreading it around.
"I feel bad for the kids of anti vaccine parents. It wasn't their choice to not get vaccinated and if they get sick they suffer. I think part of the problem is we don't commonly see the illnesses that the vaccines prevent, like polio. So in their  minds why should they give chemicals to their children to prevent a disease that they aren't likely to catch. Of course if enough people think this way, the disease the vaccines are stopping will be making a comeback.

I think the only reason to not vaccinate is if your child has a bad reaction or your family have a history of bad reactions to vaccines, none of this religious or philosophical objection crap. "
Isn't the point of vaccinating your child to prevent them from getting sick? So what would it matter if a kid who wasn't vaccinated was placed in a room full of kids who were? 
"There have been numerous studies done all over the world by tons of different organizations and they have never found a link between autism and vaccines. The ratio of kids without autism to those that do is identical in groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated children.

Hit the nail on the head with that one. If there's a correlation between violent behavior and violent video games, one should not jump to the conclusion that video games are causing the behavior. Equally possible (at least, probably more so) is the notion that violent people gravitate toward violent media in general because it fulfills some of their fantasies, and violent video games are a part of that. Also: it could be any number of underlying factors influencing both aspects of personality (confounding variable) but that's another discussion entirely.

I'm sad that your intelligent input is being downvoted. I took a course about Video Game Theory and Philosophy at UCLA (yes, i'm serious) and the Bobo Doll experiment was part of our discussions. Video game violence DOES have a correlative behavioral influence on the actions of children younger than 8-years-old. I'm too lazy to go searching for the exact academic sources, but it's out there.
"I'll say it, I kind of agree with you. KIND OF.  

I think exposure to violence does desensitize people in some way to the idea of violence.  With the amount of death videos/pictures online, nightly news of violence, violence in movies/TV, and violence in video games.  These things are firsts for humans.  In the past, to see violence, it was first hand.  You saw the beginning, during, and aftermath of the violence.  Today it's a quick second of violence and it's gone, no clean up, no somebody picking up body parts, taking away the reality of violence.  

I don't think it increases violence on a whole.  In fact, I think this has reduced violence.  War for example, we get nightly video of death from wars around the world, we can experience the realities of war third hand that no society in history has.  I feel like on a whole, seeing the violence of war through media nightly makes people more averse to war than the weekly written reports that were received in wars of the past.  

With that said I don't see how this increase in no consequences violence doesn't effect people with latent related issues.  I'm not a doctor or psychologist, but it just doesn't make sense to me that it doesn't effect some people.  I'm not saying it is the cause of violence.  People that commit these atrocities were already fucked up before they picked up a remote or controller.  Exposure to violence probably wasn't the single catalyst for their actions, but I just don't see how it doesn't have some kind of effect.  Regulating media/video games is not the answer. I don't know what the answer is, I don't pretend to.  Just saying I kind of agree with you.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far.  "
"There is this wonderful thing in the scientific world that says ""Correlation does not equal causation"". Tons of shit are correlated together, and you can design any kind of correlation to prove your specific point. "
I am now 19 years old and have been playing violent video games since I was 8 or 9. I have never been in a fight and hate hearing about violence in the real world of any kind.

Calm down doesn't annoy me when I'm actually heated. If you were to say it to me while I'm yelling I would self-evaluate and adjust accordingly. That being said, if you say it to me when I'm just pointing out my viewpoints I *will* get pissed off.
The problem is 9.9 times out of 10 when someone has told me to calm down I wasn't at all angry. Its at its base an ad hominem and a childish way of attempting to 'win' an disagreement.
"If someone is upset about something to the point where they're yelling, telling them to ""calm down""  shows that you

1. aren't taking them seriously

2. don't understand why they're upset

3. are trying to tell them what to do/take control of the situation. 

edit: First, acknowledge what is making them upset. If they're bitching about something as a way to vent, let them vent. A very useful way to show empathy is to mirror the facial expressions that they are making. If you're smiling while they're furious, it's just going to piss them off even more.

Speak in a calm, even tone. Don't let their behavior affect your attitude. After a while they'll eventually calm down enough to have an actual conversation and listen to reason.

Indeed. I'll type a response to something with the voice in my head being a rational, calm comment, barely above a whisper. When someone says something along the lines of ""god, you don't need to get so bent out of shape about it"" I have to go back and re-read my comment 10 times to figure out how they got that out of what I said."
"That is such a fantastic thing. Telling people with a temper (read: me) to calm down in insinuating that their problem isn't worth getting mad about. And while that may or may not be true, they obviously think it is worth being angry about, so telling them to calm down comes across as saying ""Oh quit whining and get over it"". It's not a rational way to perceive that, but it's very effective at adding to the anger. And most often, we will calm down if we're just given a bit of space to collect ourselves, especially as we get older and learn to manage our anger."

My surname is not pronounceable if you don't know mandarin Chinese, so I don't mind when people mess it up. Likewise, all other Chinese people I know talking about themselves in English use an Americanized pronunciation.
"That does run into the problem of their name using letters, or even entire sounds, that are not present in your language, though. For example, I have Chinese friends with both American and Chinese names (pretty common). Learning to pronounce their Chinese names wasn't impossible, but getting the sounds right took a lot of practice. It's just that, if you're not going to know them or talk to them for long (more than a single conversation), learning the proper pronunciation may be more trouble than it's worth for both parties. On the flip side, I don't think it's really all that rude if it's not deliberate. A friend of mine works with customers from different cultures, and a Mexican man once apologized and explained that her name (Stephanie) was giving him trouble because, in Spanish, such a name would actually begin with an E, so he kept forgetting not to add the extra syllable at the beginning. She basically told him, ""Yeah, that's no big deal,"" and moved on because she understood that his native language influenced the sounds he knew and how he made them.

tl;dr: maybe it's not quite so rude as that, considering the language specificity of some sounds. If it's intentional and they don't try to learn, that's kinda douchey, but otherwise, it's a forgivable offense."

I'm more than happy to tell people; I just don't expect to be attacked for using it. That's my only complaint. I don't know every word out there either and love encountering new ones and sharing what I do know.
"I feel your pain, man. I got to a job interview early and decided not to embarrass myself and chose the nice, secluded, one cubicle bathroom tucked away where no one really goes. I had a particularly traumatic experience which only intensified when I began to frantically search for the painfully absent paper.

Thankfully I had gone for a breakfast at a greasy spoon (though arguably the potential source of all my misery) and picked up more serviettes than needed which I absentmindedly stuffed into my coat pocket. Hoorah, I thought! Cheap, I later realised after attempting to 'tidy up' with the crap skinflint equivalent of the paper towel with the wiping power of greaseproof paper...

I didn't get the job."
"Poor communication would be saying something long winded when you could use a simple, more succinct word to get the point across. That is what language is for. If you don't know the word, fine, I'll explain it; I hardly know the full extent of the English language but to criticise someone for knowing something simply because you don't is just being rude and frankly, ignorant.

it's the same in writing: It's considered a faux pas to say ""he walked slowly"" where a simpler, more effective way to get that point across could be ""he crept/tiptoed"" etc. Again, ""faux pas"" effectively demonstrates something which could require more time and effort to spell out than just using the correct term for it."
"Well, so far as ""ri-coh-ta"" goes, it's probably because you're not what we call ""correct"", by the traditional meaning of the word.

You might be familiar with some regional Italian pronunciation, but pretty much every English pronunciation guide...and the Italian ones I could find...they all list it along the lines of ""ree-CAH-tah"" or ""ree-CAW-tah"" (the latter of which you might be going for?)

Other than that, pronunciation is largely regional. If you say ""kwa-SAWN"" instead of ""kruh-SANT"", you're going to look like a tool in Boston even though you'll look like an idiot for doing the reverse in France. 

Language isn't black-and-white, there aren't universal pronunciations for words that have been Anglicized or re-purposed in a language other than their own. If you adopt the original pronunciation, even though it has been all but discarded by the people you are speaking to, you won't sound more educated or intelligent. You'll sound like a pretentious jackass.
"
"Just as an aside to this, a friend of mine once gave me a great piece of advice on this issue by making an analogy to his son being afraid to fly on planes. He told his son ""Being afraid that the plane is going to crash won't keep the plane in the air, and it won't make it crash either."" In a relationship, being afraid that your girl is going to cheat isn't going to stop her from doing it. The plane will crash, or it won't. Your girlfriend will cheat, or she won't. Worrying about it won't help, but knowing what to do if it does happen might."
Being cheated on shatters that pretty quick. Also the girls who want their guy to 'fight for them', etc. 
"But hey, just because in football there is a goalie, doesn't mean the other team can't score..

It's hard to think that way when Ryan Reynolds walks through the door and starts penising all over the place.

If I am walking through a desert and I see a little puddle I will surely stop, but that mirage of an oasis is fairly tempting.
I honestly hate this type of idea. It's true for mature women and men but other then that it's not true at all. But that is my two cents.
Yup. I help out my girlfriend at an event her mother organizes once per year. (Her mom is the manager of a local radio station.) Her ex works for the station, and I used to think just like OP did until I realized this.
Then the moment when the other guy sometimes actually gets lucky with your girl and you fall into a pit of anger,depression,self hate, and hate of the general human race. And then it all seems fine and it happens again... excuse me while I go punch something very hard until it or me breaks
That's the problem, the other guys are sexy as shit compared to my homely self and whenever they come by she always shows subtly that she likes them... It kills me a little every time.
Past relationships of cheating ladies can really hurt this way of thinking. Don't date a woman who has cheated before you fucking idiot, you are not special she will cheat on you.
"Lemme guess. You have all of his Facebook/email passwords and occasionally throw out the fake profile to see what he does?

I'm sorry, this might not be true for you, but I envision similar-type relationships going down like this. I watch too many talk shows."
In a way it could be a compliment, but where I live it is always these dirty street rats that like to yell nasty shit to women or call them like they are dogs. I lost my temper once on those filthy sacks of shit.
Yay.... wait... What if she finds the guys desirable physically but stays with me Cuz I make her feel good but not at all because I'm attractive? What if she, my own girlfriend finds me ugly just like everyone else? She does.
"Same thing with telling somebody suffering from anxiety to ""Just relax.""  A. It doesn't work that way.  B. Say ""just"", or anything else to imply simplicity that isn't there, one more time and I will remove your eyes with a melon baller."
"serious question, when wanting to approach someone about the fact they may have an eating disorder is it better if they say something like ""I'm worried because you are beginning to look unhealthy"" rather than something like ""what the hell why are you so skinny, eat a burger"" which happens the majority of the time?"
The 'disgusting' remark happened to my friend on a bus to visit me once, after she's been working her ass off to gain weight, and called me just absolutely sobbing saying she was just going home :(
"""to what fucking end? because I want people to pity me? yeah that's definitely what I want""

people are so dumb"
this reaction is the reaction that makes me reluctant to talk to people whenever I go through a period of severe depression.
Yeah, for sure, considering we don't often do this with physical conditions. You wouldn't say you broke your toe if all you did was stub it a little. You wouldn't say you're having an awful migraine if you only have a passing eye-strain headache. 
"The problem with your first example is that depressed is a mood. It's a vanishingly rare person who goes through life without ever being depressed. It's just not even remotely the same as depression and the linguistic ambiguity sure as shit doesn't help anybody understand what it already a pretty complex and subtle thing.

The people who claim to have depression because they're bummed about something are a problem, though."
"This girl on my facebook calls her baby ""bipolar"" because she cries, and then calls herself bipolar when she simply gets mad at someone."
"ugh and not even just that;

""oh my god I went to talk to my crush and got all shy I am like, *such* an introvert"""
I hate that last one. People tell me that I shouldn't be depressed because I have a good life and don't have anything to be depressed about. I don't think a lot of people realize that there's a physical, chemical reason for depression. It's not just being sad about stuff.
The idea is that your phone is on silent. It's your fault if you check your phone. It's much better than calling someone. 
Nope. They should be paying attention to when the light changes, not their phone. If you really need to text someone, pull well off the road or into a parking lot somewhere.
Went to see paranormal activity 3 in theaters, some 12 year old next to my group didn't understand the concept of putting her phone on vibrate and was sending/receiving texts throughout the while movie. A bunch of times there was an intense scene where it's all quiet and then *ding ding*. 
This happened to me before, do you thinks its better to say sorry to everyone (just saying it loud) or to just turn it off and shut up
"I was at the alamo drafhouse for date day with my husband. We were able to go during the day in the middle of the week. Well their rules are super strict about phone use, but we had a sitter so I put my phone on vibrate and stuck it in my purse. 

Apparently on the iphone the ""vibrate"" mode doesn't matter if you have a daily alarm set, and I have one set to go off when my kids get off the bus. So it starts going off, but the movie is so loud that I can't figure out what kind of jerk is letting their phone go off. I even look at the lady next to me and we both give a confused shrug. Until my husband says ""dude WTF? That's your phone!"". It was so embarrassing! 

I apologized to the people around me afterward, I'm just thankful it wasn't a full theater. "
"but there's a warning that says ""please switch off your phones during the movie"" before it starts. In spite of that? you expect me not to go apeshit?"
These days people have this knee-jerk 'all violence is wrong' attitude, but I maintain that having everyone around that person grab them and bodily throw them out of the theater via the emergency exits would be entirely appropriate and give that person some much-needed feedback.
The third possibility is the girl who is so disorganized/oblivious/careless that she can't find her phone in her purse. Yes, there are a lot of things in there, but only one is blinking, vibrating, and playing a song. Hellen Keller could have found the damn thing by now. 
"Just curious, do people consider quietly talking during/between trailers rude? Because I do that, but not loud enough that you would be able to hear like a row or two away. I never talk during the movie unless it's just whispering ""I have to get another drink"" or ""gotta go to the bathroom"" or something."
I went to a dollar movie and some guy lights a cigarette in the last five minutes because he knows we all wanted to see the end. He slipped out during the final scene. 
"When watching 8 mile at Uni someone started smoking in the cinema. Being British there was lots of quiet coughing pointing out our displeasure which caused the chav who was smoking to stand up and basically justify his smoking due to not being able to afford nicotine patches.

Someone from behind me then ran down and punched the smoker square in the face (one punch landed - seemed a good one). It was brilliant. (Smoker left and didn't come back)."
"I got a call during the previews once, I answered and said ""No, I can talk. I'm just at the movies right now"". It was just the previews so I didn't think it mattered. "
Hah, went to Gravity last Wednesday and the guy next to me started browsing sports sites and looking at scores. He quit it after I told him though.
We may have been in the same theatre, my brother decided it would be a good idea to start Facebook messaging his girlfriend in the movie.
"It only takes one person to fix that, and that one person could be you. Everyone is thinking the same thing and you are always the good guy for calling someone out in a movie theater.  I see people do it all the time and its fantastic. 

I only had once, and it was some jackoff in the front row texting the WHOOLE MOOVIE. 5th time and I yelled at him. There was no 6th :)"
I check my texts during movies, but only if I can press it against my leg and block all escaping light (except to my eyes), or put it under my jacket and peep at it under there. I think it's alright, as long as youve ensured others won't be bothered.
Sorry you're going through that.   Unfortunately, until that behavior gone (never, people are disgusting) you will probably always feel that.  Just try to keep it in check the best you can.  It haunts those of us unfortunate enough to have been victimized that way.
If it's bother you that much, try talking to someone professionally or talk to her first. Put yourself in her shoes, imagine all the things she had to go through. Remember that she loves you. Be there for her and catch her when she falls. 
"> now I feel like there is a **cancer inside of me entirely made of rage and hatred** that is very unstable.

That's the best way I've heard anyone describe that particular feeling, knowing that has happened to somebody you know. I can only imagine what it's like for the person it's happened to -- and I don't want to see what it can do. I always do my best to try and make the bad go away, though I know it won't ever fully."
Same here with my girlfriend man and I have honestly questioned my sanity because of it. I use to carry a knife around for protection in case somebody jumps me but now I don't trust myself with it, I threw it away the other day because I knew a guy who does that and I kept having reacquiring thoughts about using the knife on him so I got rid of it. It is sick and I hate that but I am glad that I haven't gotten use to thought of sexual abuse and rape.
Do you think the fact that she was abused by a specific minority effected the way you view that minority at all, whether consciously or unconsciously?  My girlfriend had a sexually abusive ex-boyfriend who was black, and while I've never had any ill feelings toward another race before, I get really defensive and protective when a black guy I don't know starts talking to her.  I have friends that are black, and I don't feel that way when its with them, but I hate the idea that her abusers race has made me more wary of other people based on their skin color.    
"Because you only found out about it after you were together, your body feels like it happened recently, and biologically we're programmed to feel that it could effectively kill us to have our woman impregnated by another man. I've found that addressing this bodily physical misunderstanding explicitly by telling yourself ""she is not pregnant. This happened looong before we were together"" etc in your head might help a little bit.

I came back to comment on this after an hour or so because of the race thing but that's been covered."
"Yea, I had a girlfriend who said she didn't want to have sex because her previous boyfriend raped her. Me being the shy, sensitive guy that I am never even once tried to do anything sexual unless she expressed that it was okay. She dumped me to go have ""fun"" in college and she is now dating the same boyfriend who ""raped"" her.... I don't get it either."
"Well, probably just because it's something (virtually) everyone gets instantly angry at, so people don't bother to upvote it. The most interesting ones tend to get upvoted. Basically like:

>> DAE hate when their headphones are pulled out?

> OMG, yes! Me tooo!!

>> DAE hate sexual abuse?

> Uh, yup. We all do."
Probably because it's blindingly obvious that sexual abuse is a bad thing. And more people can sympathise with the headphones thing, which is good. 
Avoid The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Swedish version.  I very nearly threw up.  My gf told me I turned pretty green during those scenes.  I haven't watched the American version because I'm worried about those scenes.
Good idea.  Seriously, keep that negative shite out of your life.  TGWTDT is fucking terrible.  I'm starting to feel kind of sick thinking about it. 
Notice the capitalized ABUSE in my original post.  That means against someone's will.   Nothing wrong with getting rough in the bedroom, as long as both parties enjoy.
Everyone thinks that because they've been wounded in general (bruises, cuts stemming from accidents, assaults etc) and they think that if they multiply it, that must be bad.  Flesh heals.  Your mind probably won't. 
She could be overreacting to the fact that American schoolchildren are forced to pledge their allegiance to the flag every day.
"Watch ""don't hug me, I'm scared"" on YouTube. Since we were children, the government has been training is to be mindless puppets. "
"Well, the intention of the public school system in America is to induce conformity as a trait in every single child that attends. There is a reason that schools are designed like prisons, complete with zero-tolerance rules, and authoritarian enforcement schemes (not to mention the increasing use of police involvement to handle matters that were previously handled by parents and teachers). 

I may disagree with the historical hyperbole, but as far as her actual perceptions go, I think she's 100% correct.

Edit: I'm as serious as a heart attack right now. I know children technically have no rights (which is disgusting, btw), but can you think of anything that the public school system resembles more than a fascist state? I wonder why it is that we are not raising adults capable of meaningful participation in a democracy. 

Edit again: a lot of fascists in this thread, huh? "

Even if it is offensive and they may picket soldiers funerals and other functions, they never (to the best of my current knowledge) violently or even attack anyone at all. So they are allowed to speak as they see fit. The same thing that allows me to say that government may suck at times is the same thing that protects them from being indicted.

Unfortunately I grew up in the town where they're based.  Just ignore them.  It's the best thing you can do.  Don't get mad, don't yell at them, don't do all that shit.  That's what they want.  They want any attention they can get.  Just act like they don't exist. 
More for personal reasons to me. It's not a hate though, it's a clawing inside my eyeballs that turns me entirely.

Piers Morgan can be outrageous, but he doesn't try to emotionally assault people like Ann Coulter.  I don't think there's much of a comparison there.  She's much more extreme than him, and cruel to anyone who might disagree with her.  I don't see that cruelty from Piers, just strong disagreement at times.
Did you actually read the AMA?  Nonconfrontational, polite questions were answered with deflections or stand-offish bullshit.
No car, no murder as the article states. The law itself is questionable, but the application in this case was following the rule of law. It sucks, but rarely does being drunk and claiming to be naive get you out of trouble with the law.
"Are you serious? He deserves life in prison with no chance of parole for this? That is unbelievable. They would have committed the burglary with or without his car anyway, finding someone else's or at a later date. 

Yeah, it was wrong of him to do that, though the exact details of his state when he said yes are questionable (I was reading about drug use maybe? or just a hangover not sure) but yeah, it was wrong. But life? No fucking way. "

Drinking alcohol is okay, if you're not getting drunk. It's low-key and just sniffing it would probably make a curious child turn away. You can have a beer, they can have apple juice and pretend it's beer.

Tobacco, not around kids in enclosed areas. It's a strong, icky smell (again, my own opinion). From what I remember, it's also tied to asthma development. Keep it outside, if a child is near keep the smoke away, ect.

Cannabis I am conflicted about. If it were legal and accepted, it should go along the lines of tobacco users. But it's still illegal in most places, and that opens a can of worms. Even though I don't believe that it should be illegal, using it in front of young children will give them an impression that it's okay to break the rules for fun. For an older child, you can use it as a discussion about questioning authority, conspiracies, equality, human rights, whatever you want to tie it to. Older children can also be more discrete and not blow your cover. But a younger child does not know the difference between federal laws, state laws, school rules and parental rules, and they don't always understand the reasoning behind most of the rules. If mommy's not supposed to smoke but she does anyway and little Billy knows, why can't he drive the car to the toy store?"
Second hand smoke is a problem. Weed also does have negative effects on the developing brain. Not to mention second hand smoke is bad for everyone in general. If you must smoke, just don't do it around the kids. 
"To be honest being 0/20 doesn't even mean feeding to me.

The first step towards being pretty okay at something is sucking."

I was completely uninterested after the first two episodes of Homeland. I felt all the characters were so awful I couldn't care about them. My husband still wanted to give it a chance, so we had it on and I wasn't paying full attention. Then I saw the end of the episode. I will admit, they may have won me back over. I didn't see it coming and it was an awesome twist.
This week's was pretty awful until the last 5 minutes. This entire season I feel started out rough. Why are they trying to make Dana sexy?
"I just recently caught up on the last season of TWD. The episode titled ""Prey"", I think, made me rage so hard. The whole episode was just a cat and mouse game, really not much progress and all filler."
yeah, I mean it's still terrible that people can be that judgemental, but the WBC are just so *proud* about their beliefs. It makes me want to go to America, get a gun and kill them. Like, seriously.
Same here. Ever since I switched to contact lenses, some light can be very bright. Without sunglasses on, my eyes get dry and I have to squint. Usually, I just wear sunglasses when I'm at stores or something, not when I'm in class or at home. Something about store lighting just kills my eyes. 
"I also equally hate those who think screaming + not metal = screamo.

according to most of my friends, my musical tastes are primarily screamo because one in maybe every 6 songs has someone screaming. empire! empire!, the world is..., dads, la dispute, etc. are not the same genre as stuff like blood on the dance floor, i set my friends on fire, etc. :("
This is even worse. ''Hey I like metal music'' ''Ooh so you like bands like As My Asshole Lies Bleeding and The Eternal Darkness of Phravulence'' or something like that, and they think I'm one of those godawfulguitar-doublekick-screamo metalheads whereas I just like Iron Maiden, Saxon and such.

Put every music genre in that category. I don't think there's a single genre that people haven't said takes no talent.

Reddit opinion is not a general consensus.  Neither is the opinion of your WASP-y sheltered friends.  "
Ah yes, good rap. I'm interested in hearing some, as a rock/metal person who has no real knowledge of the genre. I recently came across the song Play For Keeps and was trying to figure out if it was actually a good song, or if my crappy music detector was faulty for a few minutes. 
Some of the metal singers are astonishing. The way Mikael Åkerfeldt of Opeth can switch from growling to his amazing singing voice in a manner of seconds is just fantastic, there's no way I could do it and not ruin my vocal cords.
It always amazes me how good the singer of a hard metal band sounds when they sing acoustic versions of there song
Are you asking for recommendations on getting into metal or are you looking for a more theoretical explanation? Because I can do both if you want.
Just because people don't listen to metal and would like to listen to other types of genres doesn't mean they have bad taste in music
Agree! If I had the type of voice and lung capacity these metal dudes have, I would be *swimming* in pussy.
You criticize people for judging the music you like, and then you judge music that other people like.
He's not upset that they don't share his tastes.  He's upset by what they (wrongly) infer about his character based on his tastes.

I like the event itself, and it's cool that it's going to happen in my country. But right now there are other priorities, like the public health service, that is very, VERY bad. Also, there is the safety problem. There are too many roberies and murders here, and even when the scumbags get arrested they suffer nothing, just get released the next day and end up commiting the same crimes. So, with the money spent on the World Cup we could really solve some other problems that would be way better for the population.
I just saw a news story where there was a glitch in the EBT system and people basically got out of Walmart with as much as they could even though they knew they did not have that much money on their card. It is disgusting. I feel for people who are down on their luck and need a hand. There are people who need a little help to get back on their feet. That isn't what I have seen. Most people I know who need assistance don't qualify. I did field work in an inner city school and I can't tell you how many pregnant teenagers I met who got pregnant because their mothers told them it was time to collect their welfare. It was frustrating and heartbreaking. I know this isn't everyone in the system, but it as enough to make me pretty bitter.
I currently work in a welfare office, and everything you just said really connects with me. I'm a person who wants to help people. I've never worked in a for-profit environment for more than a few weeks because the atmosphere of selfishness sickens me. But the people I see everyday makes it really hard for me not to convert to some hard-nosed conservative sociopathic mentality toward government programs. I've heard stories that are heart breaking, stories that make you realize how cruel a world it is, but in light of that there is a renewed vigor to help those who are really truly struggling and trying to improve their situation against insurmountable odds. And then I look back into the lobby and see it's half filled with selfish, ungrateful assholes who have never made any attempt at holding a job or, god forbid, not have kids for a couple years.
The rest of it aside, the kids not feeling ashamed or down about themselves because of their parents being on welfare (whether abused or not) is a good thing
How about just raise the minimum wage so this isn't an issue? If your minimum wage is so low that welfare looks like a better option, maybe that's the problem.
"They advertise themselves as providing non-judgemental pregnancy counselling and options, but their counselling is designed to pressure the woman into keeping the baby (that's not how counselling of any sort is supposed to work - it's supposed to be to help the person come to their own decision). They don't do referrals for abortion (but this isn't mentioned in their advertising materials).

They tell people that abortion gives you cancer (extensively researched and found to be not true), makes you sterile (which only happens in the unlikely event that something goes disastrously wrong), or will ruin your life in any one of a number of other horrific ways. Nothing whatsoever is mentioned about the risks of pregnancy. [Here are some recordings.](https://soundcloud.com/education-for-choice)

I never did, of course, because despite actively teaching  parents how to parent for my job, I knew that they would just ignore me.

Some college kids know about parenting, however, no one wants to be told how to be a parent, because everyone is convinced that they are a great parent. Even when they are giving their 3 year old rockstar energy drinks, but only after arguing with them for 3 minutes and then giving up, these people will somehow assume that they rule at what they do. After all: ""I love my child, I am a great parent"". Sorry, I love sandwiches, but that doesn't make me a chef, does it?

Honestly, even childless, I could probably teach many parents tricks: I can't explain why sliced turkey needed to go in the DVD player, but I can educate adults on how to engage in a dialogue that will encourage different behavior while promoting moral development.

I'm sorry for your loss. I have friends like that too, I think one of the best moments was when one of the culprits had her kid recently...now she complains about people doing that lol. I still have some friends who do it but I just ignore them, they all eventually plan on kids so they will all learn. My thinking and response if I get to ticked off about it is this. Did you or your significant other carry the animal for 9 months? Does your pet wake you up every 1.5 hours? Do you have to physically sit there and feed your pet? Can you leave your 6 month old puppy or kitten home alone for several hours? K STFU ABOUT YOUR DOG BEING LIKE MY BABY!

See, this is not a problem to me. Paying experienced teachers at competitive rates for skilled professionals seems perfectly reasonable. It's a very important, difficult job, and you don't seem to appreciate that the skill it takes to *teach* a room full of high school kids high-school level material is considerably greater than the skill it takes to learn the material as a student.

Before attaining your complete license you must first wear plastic squares with a big P (red first for a certain time, then rank up to green P) on your car in plain view and your license identifies you as a P-plater. The P means provisional, indicating that your are still relatively new to driving. There are also restrictions for speed limits and number of passengers while on P's.
"In Australia, before you get a full drivers licence, you have to go through 3 different stages of a licence before you can get the full licence.
You have to display a sticker on the front and back of your car to advise the police and other drivers of what stage you are at. We have L for people just learning how to drive, once you do 120 hours you can get your red P plates, where it's ok to drive alone, but you can't drink and drive at all, and you can't have more than 1 person under the age of 18 in your car unless there's a person with a full licence in there. And then you get your green p plates where You can do everything a full licensed person can, but you can't drink."
Provisional License. It's what you get for 3 years in Australia (probably also other countries) before you have your full license. There are restrictions on speed, amount of passengers you can have, amount of points on your license etc

On my bike I can do it in 45 minutes. Despite following all of the rules (yes, I do stop a red lights like most people), I can average 17mph on my way to work. Each day I get a bit of exercise on my way into work and I start the day feeling good.

"The simple answer would be to means-test them in my opinion. It creates jobs for people to go around and make sure the system isn't being abused.

Oh god. Yes. My dad not only curses at inanimate objects, but he'll punch the fucking thing. I've seen him hit his head while getting into the car and swing at the edge aboce the door.

Because the school is fucking retarded.  They suspend anyone that has anything to do with drugs and/or alcohol.  
Ok first you are assuming schools all have cameras with good angles on every possible place there could be a fight.  That would have to include outside, random corners, locker rooms, bathrooms, basically a lot of places.  Then with your hypothetical perfect camera system, how do you really know who started the fight?  The one who started punching?  The one who started the talking before the fight?  The one who was bullying the other while the other was standing up for themself after years of abuse?  There's a lot of variables in who is the one who deserves to be punished and it's tough to determine which one is which.  
That makes me pretty mad, how can you blame the victim or how can you punish someone for defending themselves? This teaches.kids not to defend themselves and that's (obviously) not a good thing
Actually all. They’re half-decent headphones, but they’re 2-3&#215; overpriced for their quality of sound and construction.

"I disagree, it's fucking irritating whatever it is, the tiny speakers are going to make it sound awful. The story was about ""ghetto rap"" with unused dr.dre headphones, it's your assumption that reddit only complains because it's rap...

Calm down, Quanell.  Seems to me if the kid was blasting it, everyone in the vicinity could tell the quality of the lyrics.
Seriously. Sounds like a bee caught between a window and a screen door!  I don't know how people can tolerate it.
Yes... In 8th grade I was in a fight where I defended myself. Swung after being hit twice, and was given a ticket, by the police...
And here I thought self defense was a basic human right, oh wait school age children don't have the same rights in a school as adults do everywhere I forgot.
"Yep. I got sucker punched by someone because he tripped over my feet. I even apologized, even though it wasn't my fault at all. He walked away, I resumed my previous conversation, and then he came back and punched me on the side of the face.

never had a problem, don't get caught. use your elbows and knees to avoid bloody knuckles and keep it short
Well unless the school has a court, how are you supposed to make your case? Everything is word of mouth. The school will suspend both of the kids, because it will eliminate the possibility of only suspending the wrong one. The staff is not going to go talk to kids who are probably lying, nor go through video tapes (unless there was a crime committed). The rule is set in for the school to walk away from it, not to punish the defender. Also, if the kid doesn't defend himself and gets his ass kicked the school gives the kid a break for being a pussy. 
At my high school, you didn't even have to defend yourself. If you got punched and just took the blows without ever sending a punch their way, you still got suspended. So, there was no reason not to fight back. 
This story is so perfect I'm gonna believe it no matter what anyone says. Congrats on raising a great kiddo.
Sounds like that school district doesn't have a zero tolerance policy which ties the hands of many administrators.
"when I was 11 I was being bullied by a neighbor hood kid, my dad told me that if he
ever lay a hand on me to kick his ass. that's just what I did. then bully's mom called my parents to let them know I kicked her kids ass, I got mcdonalds (parents aren't big on fast food) and he got a black eye"
I work at a school. A few years ago, a little girl (4th grade) was suspended along with two boys for fighting back when they pinned her on the ground at recess and laid on top of her. Zero tolerance. Stupidest phrase I've ever heard. 
"My little brother did the same thing in 7th grade. Two kids were trying to wrestle a smaller kids backpack off his back. One of them looked at my brother and hit him in the stomach and they fought till a teacher broke it up. 

My dad was furious. He was going to sue the district but my little brother just wanted him to let it go. My brother was suspended for a day. 

I got 3 days for fighting back once. That school district will always remember my father. "
Give your son a pat on the back for me. Way to raise you kid the right way. I can tell you are a good father! 
"my dads advice was a touch different. Try to avoid fighting at all costs. Try. if somebody pushes you too far, don't let them hit you. its a fight. There is winning and losing. So, story time. Playing baseball my junior year, one of my teammates was a complete dick to me. i was small back then, not so much now. so i told him to name a time and place, or shut the fuck up and leave me alone. he tells me to meet him at the baseball field after school lets out. So my parents normally picked me up. I get in the car, tell my dad ""I have to go fight this kid at the baseball field."" He looks at me and says ""you have to?"" I said I had to. It had gone too far. He said okay, gunned the truck, and drove over there. He got out of the truck, and the other kid says ""oh look you brought your daddy to fight for you, what a bitch""

My dad looks at the kid and says nope, Im just here to make sure none of your bitch ass friends jump in once he starts beating your ass. I get out of the truck, take off my jacket, and start walking towards him. There is a whole fucking circle of people that makes room for me to get in. He looks at me and starts to say "" He's a bitch, he won't do any-"" and then i punched him in the jaw, and knocked him down. backed up, let him stand up, then hit him again. He dropped that time, I kicked him in the ribs a couple of times, spit on him, waited to see if he'd get up again, then got back into the truck. We drove to jack in the box, I got an ultimate cheeseburger and went home. He never said a word to my mom. Love the shit out of my dad."
"I was in sixth grade and was and still am small for my age but at that point I had been taking karate for 8 years and was working on my second degree when some 8th grader heard I took karate and thought he could take him long story I literally broke his penis I kneed him so hard in the groin he vomited. He went to the hospital and found I had twisted the shaft 760 degrees around cutting off all blood flow and popped a testicle. Nobody ever messed with me again.

TL; DR I literally ganked a bully in sixth grade."
I was attacked by a much bigger kid entirely unprovoked. I happened to have a BIC pen in my hand so I jacked him in the temple with it a couple times. We were both suspended from school. My dad basically told the principal that he was a moron. I was in 0 trouble at home. That kid claims permanent brain injury. 
"""Never start a fight, but, always finish one,"" That sounds like something an ex-boxer/fighter would say. "
My dad gave me the same advice except he added something onto it. Always wear your ring on your right hand. He said that since I am right handed. 
Yup, the old man said the same. I had a kid who decided to throw a piece of pizza at me (we had a history) and he though I wouldn't do anything. Scrapped him and won. Feel a lot better too.
"Whenever someone pulls the 'violence is never the answer' card, I become infuriated, I follow the zero agression principle, religiously, BUT you are going to tell me that we shouldn't have resorted to violence in WWII? and if that doesn't get through to them I pitch this hypothetical situation, I have a 3 foot tire iron in my car. Should I decide to begin beating you with it, at what point is violence justified in your mind?

"I'm not the worlds most confrontational individual, but if I were the parent, I'd be getting the cops to charge the little shit bully with assault, and then suing the school into oblivion for failing their duty of care. 

Either that or go full hulk and demolish the school office in a fit of apocalyptic rage.

Educators need to stop being whiny little pussies and start handing out real punishment to bullies. None of this political correct handholding shit, and none of the ""free week of holiday from school for the bully"" bullshit either."
"Fuck this run away bullshit. In high school some guy thought it funny to start flicking and otherwise annoying me in my history class. Then one day, I fucking called him out after he made some shitty comment. ""If you have something to say say it to my face asspan"". He swung, hit me in the head, and I dislocated his arm and smashed his head into a desk. Admin said I should have run away. Fuck that. If someone's attacking me the threat will be eliminated before I leave. "
And people are always so damn surprised when kids bring weapons to school. I just accept it as normal now that we will see violence in schools. Hell the middle school near me has a active police officer with his car there every day. Until schools start waking up and following fair policies, kids who are victims will find outlets which are sometimes violent. I don't blame them, I blame the school.
I'd pay a visit to that administrator and punch him or her in the face, then yell at them for not fighting back.
This is what lawyers are for. That school district owes her for all her medical bills, damages, legal fees, and they can stipulate the administrator must be fired, or just throw a book of ADA violations at them...
I've inherited a no-bullshit trait from my mother. I try not to swear in professional environments like school or work, but I will not hesitate to call bullshit right in the administrators face in situations like that.
"That's fucked.  Now you'll get: ""I'm failing anyway, might as well go out with a bang and take somebody with me.""  "
If you get punched you punch someone else. Then the person that got punched by you punches someone else. Repeat till everyone in the shop is punched. If everyone gets kicked out and suspended, no one will be.

Some schools aren't in amazing neighborhoods.  Ohio State is basically a college in the middle of a pretty typical urban neighborhood, so there's a fair amount of robbery and assault, for example.  It's not always a problem with the school (though the ridiculous amount of sexual assault that happens in dorms very much is)
"No, no, the friend didn't mention me, it was the kid he was kicking that dropped my name.  All four students thought it was pretty absurd that the kids that got shoved out of the way were in the most trouble.  The principal had made his decision, though, and there was nothing a few kids could tell him to reconsider.

For some reason, I was at fault for two kids fighting."
And teach your kids to defend themselves by any means necessary. If they're going to get suspended just like their attacker, they might as well put them in the hospital.
I meant on the other side of the divider. like if I'm going east, and someone westbound is pulled over, and now everyone going east slows down. 
I don't think there's anything wrong with being bothered by that. It's really distasteful IMO. She's basically whoring out someone else's tragedy for her own validation. She's not grieving, she's wallowing in something that has nothing to do with her. Shallow and very insensitive to the people who were actually affected. 
"I know someone like this. Every time some one in the area tragically dies she ""knew them well"" or was ""very close to them"" or one of their family members and is so shaken by it that she has to call out of work or does nothing but talk about it while she is at work. It's usually pretty obvious she didn't give a piss about them while they were alive and uses their passing as a way to get sympathy or attention. "
"Sounds like a girl I dated once. This girl, however, also claimed to be Bi, and she was constantly bitching about how she never got equal treatment from people because she was Bi.

Here's the thing, she told *everyone* that she was Bi, and she usually rubbed people's faces in it.

Actually, she didn't seem to have any natural filter. She once told a 16-year-old girl operating a fudge stand that she (the girl I dated) was on her period."
In the same vein, when someone dies at a school, they act like they were the dead person's best friends when in reality they talked once.
God that sounds just like a girl I knew from school. When we were in 9th grade a boy a couple years our senior had a brain hemmorrhage due to an aneurysm and was brain dead. Our school was catholic so we had mass to pray for him while he was in the hospital. She found out because of this and went to visit him and cry by his side EVERY SINGLE DAY until his parents' pulled the plug. She also went to his funeral and cried beside the coffin. She didn't know him at all.
"My cousins do that crap all the time. They also made my grandpa's death specifically about them. His ""ghost"" appeared to each one of them for a while afterwards. The man had something like 20 grandkids, but only those three were visited by his ghost. They STILL make it about them almost 20 years later."
"This is how I feel about famous people.

Yes, losing a child is a horrible thing.

"Alternatively, you can ""unsubscribe"" from any of their updates/posts. I'm still their friend, but I don't see any of their crap on my newsfeed."

Some people don't realise that their posts are annoying, others are just plain annoying and proud of it."
Yeah, maybe the soup wasn't the best example, but it's usually how they word it.  It's only a few people on my list, but they always seem so damn proud of themselves for doing things that everyone else does as well.

no, it's just you taking things literally and ruining a perfectly good joke. Which, coincidentally, it the thing that instantly makes *me* angry
Exactly! On the flip side, i always hated when people thought i was spoiled/privileged in high school because i had a really nice laptop. They all aimed my parents bought it for me, in reality i saved up a lot of money and bought it myself when it was on sale during president's day.
I wish more people would understand this. I'm from an upper-middle class (1%-er) family and my dad (parents are divorced) gives me typically $500+ for Christmas and my birthday and then some random gifts ($100-200) throughout the year. And then I get rather large gifts ($50+) from the rest of my family. I thank everyone and 75% of the cash gets put into savings or invested. And whenever I decide to go shopping and spend $100-200 on clothes or something, all my friends call me spoiled and treat me differently like because I'm priviledged I'm a bad person.
"Most privileged people will know the value of things. Spoiled people will know the price. 

I have a friend who has so much handed to him, and losing something isn't a big deal because he didn't buy it himself. He lost his wallet that had $200 in it, and never made a big deal of it. If I lost $200, I would be sad for a few days.

"Driving on the 5 in California, this happens all the time. I go to pass someone, and they speed up and basically tailgate the person ahead just to not let me in. 

"
It's just that when I see you passing me I realize I am driving too slow, I wasn't watching my speed.
I try to subvert the norm and always let people merge in and pass me.  It probably makes very little dent in the traffic flow sadly.
I hate that I have the racers syndrome. It feels like I have to get past you and once I do I win but I'm going about it inconspicuously by not going too fast. It's stupid and I'm trying to stop
"I'm a Connecticut driver, often driving on I-95 and the merit parkway/garden state parkway. 

For me, I guess it's a special situation, but people that try to pass on the right when the left lane had a huge line. I will match your speed for 50 miles straight, I am in line, don't try to cut. Do I let you cut at the grocery store? No, so don't try to cut me on the freeway. 

This is especially true in New Jersey where drivers will try to jump in line/cut you off just because you're not tailgating.

Fuckin barbaric."
"I say this all the time, it really does seem to be a race, but I think it has to do with people and their obsession with power/dominance. They want to be in the front, as much as possible at least, and when you pass them it angers them that they are now 'losing.' They feel that they are now being dominated on the road, so they either race to get in front of you, or speed up 'so you can't take their place.' In reality it doesn't matter at all whether you just jumped in front of one car; it makes a difference of mere seconds.

I think that for most people that do this, it is mostly subconscious. If I ever run into anyone like this (ex. - ALMOST EVERYONE, which makes sense, actually) I always assume that they are either power hungry, or scared of being 'dominated.'"
"I think they didn't realize how slowly they were going until they noticed they were getting passed.

Still, it's enraging.  On the occasions when I've been the dipshit there, I accept that the passing car was alert and I was not, so they get to pass.  Then I accelerate to their speed."
I think it's not intentional. People like to drive the same speed as everyone else, so if someone sees that everyone else is going faster than them, they'll speed up to match without thinking about it.
The only time people think with their genitals while handling a weapon. I used to get pissed off at everyone on the road, and I used to retaliate when I thought someone was slighting me. I've stopped caring. I've learned that I don't know their side of the story, and never will. I choose to trust that most people had a good reason to act the way that they did, and as for driving in general? These days, I just don't give a fuck about getting somewhere quickly. I'll get there when I get there, that's life - and I may as well enjoy the drive along the way.
Exactly...that's how accidents are caused and it just makes it that much more worse for everyone else.
"To your last sentence. That's the situation I'm in. I just don't like having to waste gas passing these cars. I set my cruise, and I go. Having to downshift and get on the throttle is such a waste. 
"
Why can't you just wait for them to pass though? Pacing a car because you realized you were not going as fast as you wanted to be is an accident waiting to happen. 
Sooo...you continue to block the passing lane when someone clearly would like to pass???  Who is the douchebag again?
Not even on the highways. I went there in July to visit family and EVERYONE speeds on all roads. Even the side roads. My mom wasn't driving fast enough so some guy laid down on his truck horn and started yelling at us.
I don't know why Texas is so bad. It was just horrible. We drove through Houston while we were on vacation. It was one of the scariest things I've done. 
I've lived in many states, Colorado being one of them, Colorado has the best drivers out of any state I've lived in or been to.
"EXACTLY! They're always in big Silverados with ""TEXAS EDITION"" on it or F150s with ""KING RANCH EDITION"". They speed around in these huge trucks. If they hit someone, they wouldn't be nearly as hurt as someone in a smaller car."
But then I feel mean. I just casually speed past at 95 mph and over take them. If I honked and it was a frail old lady, I'd feel bad .
I understand, I ride a motorcycle so it's tough to always maintain a steady speed. It's not so much pointed at people that don't have cruise control, but at those in the fast lane that don't use it/have it and go above the speed limit, below the speed limit, above, below, repeat.
Living in New York, I do agree with this.  PA drivers are terrible for the most part.  NJ drivers don't bother me as much because I like to get where I am going too, but when they run red lights and cut people off to shave .6 seconds off of their drive, fuck that.
I've always found Maine drivers to be overly passive on the whole. But maybe I've been living out of state for to long now.
Apparently a car flipped near exit 8? Didn't go that way but seems to have caused a nice clusterfuck. 
At least the streets in Maine are wide enough to even possibly pass a slowpoke.  Well, where I've driven (Orono, Bangor, Portland, South Portland and Kittery).
people do that!?!? i swear to god, if i see someone doing that, i'll just grab their phone and chuck it across the cinema. 
I'll get a manager midway through the movie. I don't mind missing three minutes of a movie. I really fucking hate it when assholes are illuminating the theatre every four minutes. 
"I don't even ask nicely. People should know better. Movies are expensive. I just say, ""Put your phone away, or I'm going to go get a manager.""

I'd rather miss three minutes of a movie and be able to enjoy the rest of it than be constantly interrupted by assholes who can't turn off their phones for 2 hours. The few times it's actually come to me getting a manager, the manager asks them to leave, and has refunded my ticket. "
"Last Friday, I almost turned to the perma-texter next to me in the theater and asked ""So, who are you talking to? Can I have some skittles?"" And just bother him until he put his phone away. 

Sadly, it remained an *almost* scenario. I silently seethed instead."
It involves years of training, but the euphoria when you finally manage to kick a sit is worth all the sacrifices.
"Maybe unlike you, most people have decent peripheral vision? Once something catches your eye, it's hard not to notice it. Also you missed a bunch of signs walking to your screen that say cell phones must be turned off and being told at least twice after you are seated to turn the phone off.

If texting is so important, why not save your money and not go to the movie theater? You can get them movie streaming less than 3-4 weeks after it comes out anyways. Then you can text until the phone dies or your fingers lock up - whichever comes first."
I'm similarly baffled why it bothers people.  I'm not one to check my phone during a movie, but I don't give a flying fuck if other people do, so long as it's quiet.  People complain about the light, but the screen is a thousand times brighter than someone's phone.  Besides which, why are you even looking *down*? The movie's up there buddy.
Well that $25 paid for one movie ticket, something that would cost about $15 in America, an average pay for an hour. So it's still basically 1 movie ticket per hour. And now I think we should probably all just get paid in movie tickets.
"Thats...really not that much when you're in the real world. 

It ends up being around 50k/yr which is like one step above entry level pay in most corporate/office jobs. 
"
Good on the guy for calling the teens out! From what I hear it might not be a bad idea to tell a theatre worker about that shit. I know their job sucks, but I bet they'd be willing to tell some idiots off. 
I was the exact opposite.  I was like a morphing piece of jelly that would just woompaloop around them and keep going.  I got weird looks, but I didn't care.

"People at my school block the only path between our old school and our new school constantly. I have to go from the back of the old campus to the front of the school and then to the back of the new campus in six minutes.

You should walk really, really close behind them so your crotch is almost touching their arse. That's the Audi way.

"Yeah in my school its seen as being nerdy or ""keen"". I read loads, and at the school library actually had a great conversation with my old English teacher and librarian about the lord of flies. Its great when you can talk about a book, like one of my friends is a good reader and we can actually discuss books. I just dont mention reading at school the same way I don't mention video games or anything nerdy. "
I for one love to read, but I have a group of friends who make it a point not to read. It's so bad the if I try to read at all they make fun of me like I'm wasting time. Then they go and religiously play gangnam style while playing some naruto game for 8 hours straight. Their defense? I'm a nerd who's wasting valuable skill building time by reading.

"I don't care if people don't read for fun, but I despise it when they say they ""don't read"" or ""hate reading."" Really, you hate reading which soup you like to buy, or choosing the show you want to watch off the guide, or reading the directions for the frozen pizza you bought? Grrr, that make me mad."
doesn't read or can't read? I struggled with dyslexia for many years and am quite proud of the fact that i can read, and I do enjoy it thoroughly.  I have a friend from college who never had such issues and won't read a damn book because he'd rather wait for the show/movie to come out.  of course now i am an accountant and he is a bartender/waiter.
It's pride at ignorance that's the problem, not merely having different priorities. There's nothing to be proud about not having a valuable and common life skill.

I'm guessing you missed those words? Just because you are a leading opthalmic specialist doesn't mean you look any better going ""Hahaha, I'm completely computer illiterate, I don't even know how to turn it on!""

For example I'm quite good at maths and used to tutor some friends younger siblings. While I don't understand why they don't understand the way I explained something because it seems obvious to me, I will keep trying different ways until we find one that works.

"A different set of rules apply?  What the hell are you talking about?

No matter what job you have, being computer illiterate isn't something to loudly share with everyone you know like it's funny.  If you can't check your own fucking email or Google a subject without me doing it for you, maybe you should get off your lazy fucking ass and figure it out for yourself.  It's 2013 and if you use a computer, you should probably have a basic idea of how to use it. "
"I'd argue that won't be the case for long - being technically literate is a skill that's just getting more important for everyone.

 I see your point, of course. But I think it's a bit misleading to say you can be a leader in your field with no technical literacy, when the same people you're talking about have been around longer than computers have been commonplace, in a lot of cases. They didn't have to get there in an increasingly technology centric society."
If you look at how practical it is, i would compare it to not being able to use a fridge. You can live perfectly good life storing stuff in the fridge that should go in the freezer. But learning is easy enough that you are in the wrong if you think it would be a waste of time to learn.
All... If western manners are important to him just never go to asia.  Actually, I have heard Hong Kong is bearable.
Nah I disagree. A person who hasn't be given the chance to actually learn is still ignorant. I see stupidity as being given the chance to learn and refuting it. Note there lies a line between stupidity and stubbornness.
I feel like such shit. I do this to people way too much. I was supposed to meet my friend at her place at 6, but I didn't make it there until 11. At least I showed up though, and I wasn't late for a completely stupid reason (although it is kind of stupid). I was working ~70 hours a week at the time, a day job and a night job, and I took a nap and overslept. She was understanding, but I still felt like a retard. I apologized so much she yelled at me to shut up.
"Not necessarily.  
I have a bad case of ADD, and sometimes I'm so engrossed in some project of some sort that I completely lose track of time. It's not that I don't respect them, it's that I literally need to remember to put on a timer or alarm clock to ensure I can remember it.  
...and then I forget to set the alarm.  
"
"No, I'm saying if I'm your friend it shouldn't be something to get pissed about. Frankly, and I understand this is probably something that's a bit more opinionated, but if I'm close with someone, showing up without complete rigid timing feels more relaxed and casual. If I have to hurry up to meet my friend for ""random bullshit evening #536"", my relationship feels more like a business arrangement than a friendship."
"We said no the first time he asked...but he's not the sort of person who takes a hint. After that, things got kind of distracting (you'll find this out on your big day) and it just sort of happened later in the evening.

They didn't even bother to invite us to their wedding either...so needless to say we aren't in touch anymore. "
We didn't even tell our family for a while because we weren't ready for all of the fervor planning a wedding generally entails...so I can't imagine proposing (or being proposed to) in front of them. That's way too much pressure!
"My wife and I talked about it for so long before it happened that she once joked that I didn't even need to buy her a ring, a twist-tie would suffice. It was at that moment that I finally resolved to make plans and propose to her. 

I did eventually propose to her in ""public"" (we were on vacation), but it was a crowded place so we were still anonymous. Out came the twist tie (I got one of those fancy silver foil ones), and the rest is history. There's no video, no false congratulations from random passers by...and neither one of us would change a thing. 

To be honest, from the side of the ""asker"" it is a bit of a hostage situation. I mean, I was 99% sure she was going to say yes, and yet I was extremely nervous about the whole thing.  "
Sometimes other people simply cannot stand *not* being the center of attention. This is a prime example.
"This is one of those awkward social situations.  You are with these people you don't see very often and making small talk, ""So, what's new?""

Getting engage is pretty big news, but you don't want to upstage the day, but you ain't taking off this ring.  What do you say?  

99% of the time, it's the stupid people you are talking to making a big deal out of it, ""Zomg! you're engaged?! Hey cousin X, Y, and Z; guess who got engaged?!""  "
No, no. The daughter should announce that she's *expecting* right as the son and daughter-in-law cut the cake. Bonus points if it's a long-desired pregnancy with much prior struggle.
"They should get divorced and remarried at the wedding itself. Have a huge fight and bring in a lawyer at the reception. Have makeup sex in the center of the aisle as the bride and groom are saying their vows. Then run up the aisle and say, ""MARRY US PREACHER MAN. THIS IS OUR WEDDING NOW."" 

Shit, I feel like I just described something that would be on reality TV."
i also thought i wanted a very big public in front of my family and friends proposal. and then when he asked me it was so awkward infront of everyone. and im an attention hogging outgoing person. it was a special moment that i felt i needed to share with them and i didnt want to.
"I feel like this is one of those ""know-your-partner!"" kinds of things.

If you know your partner well enough and kind of KNOW before hand that they'll say yes, by all means go and make a special day. But please, KNOW your partner, and for Heaven's sake don't steal someone else's day..."
"I agree that everyone is different, but as the guy who will be doing the proposing, there is enough pressure in private, even if you are ""sure"" they will say yes. 

This is me being completely selfish, however. If I were with someone who wanted the proposal to be a public display I would have a different mindset. But if that were the case, I would pretty much already be engaged before I actually asked her. I've never thought of having that much rehearsal before popping the question. I certainly didn't have it with my previous GF of almost 5 years. There were times where I thought she might have said yes, but I was never certain, and that turned out for the better as she ended up leaving. "
"> I would love a public proposal (and my bf knows it).

High maintenance, eh?

> I want to share my happiness with the rest of the world.

Just so you're aware: the rest of the world, for the most part, won't give a shit that you got engaged."
"I agree.

While it is still a cheesy romance movie move, I think that a romantic dinner in a dimly lit, fancy restaurant with as few people around as possible is the way to go. I would reserve a private room if possible. And if you ask and tell them you want to make a marriage proposal private, I think most restaurant managers would be happy to oblige! 

There are an infinite number of other private opportunities for proposals, but that one always seems nice to me. "
"Different strokes!

But I'd never be comfortable proposing in public. Though I've never had a long term GF that has convinced me that she wants to spend the rest of her life with me. :("
"I've never felt like it was anyone else's business but the two in love.

Why would you want to involve anyone else in something so important and intimate? "
Yeah, that's pretty private still. No grand gesture. No involving lots of other people or making a scene.
Now it's all about being a princess for a day, and it seems like 80% of the time the wedding just turns into a drama magnet.
"I worked for churches for 15 years and have literally been closely involved in over 300 wedding ceremonies. Now I work for an arts center and still work with couples and their weddings. 

The best ones are a small family and very close friends (bridal party) with a larger reception afterwards. Intimacy is important in the proposal and the ceremony. 

But this is part of cultural norms, so what's true for me is by no means true for everyone! 

"
For me the wedding ceremony is for close family and friends, the reception is more going to be a really big party. I have a lot of close friends that I don't get to see very often due to time and distance. The thought of getting them all in the same place and having a grand old time just thrills me. The last few friends' weddings I've been to have been amazing and a blast for this exact reason. I am definitely not inviting all my blood relatives, but I have over 300 on my dad's side alone, so the aunt and uncles get invited, but not all the freekin cousins (my grandma was one of 16.

"I see what you mean, but the way I imagine it is that it would probably just be stolen thunder for like 5 minutes, then it's back to the wedding. 

Now if they tried to piggyback speeches and all that, fuck them. haha"
Generally no,  but I think you have to be careful. Something you may see as positive could be something they see as negative. 
Your telling me you would stop being long term friends with someone if there was a large white head on your face and they pointed it out in private, so that you could pop it?

Fucks me right off to the point I can no longer talk."
"Agree. When people say ""you have faith in or worship science"" drives me batshit. Science isn't about faith or a belief at all. "
"This kind of highlights one of the core ideas of science. Science is a process designed to reduce bias (not to eliminate it though, that's not possible). Your inherent bias is to trust your senses, thoughts, and perceptions. To assume that your senses and your brain create a 100% accurate view of reality. But people hate to think they might be wrong.

The zeitgeist says ""question everything"", but no one ever questions their own biases. ""Question everything, except your gut feelings. Stick to your principles!"", would be more like how people think.

But yeah, back to people thinking science being an opinion. I think you're spot on there. They think it's arrogant of me to think ""science has an answer for everything"". It doesn't, of course, but it's the fact that scientific positions are actually *based* on something more than ""common sense"" and conjecture. Why do people feel that their untested opinions have more weight than scientific conclusions that have actually been tested?"
She said it was just your opinion? That's incredibly stupid. It's like saying that a lamp being a lamp is an opinion!
As irrelevant as it might be, I think that the train is moving towards the camera. The bystanders are looking away from the camera (towards the back of the train) and I think that people tend to look at the side where the train is coming from as if they are expecting something (a train arrival perhaps). 
There are a lot of stories on reddit about encountering these science-skeptic types (skepticism usually due to religious convictions), but I have yet to meet one. I guess I'm just lucky. But these stories make me fear for humanity a little.

Well, a four-frame animated gif is a trick. Maybe she meant that it's not an actual unedited video recording?
"The thing that sucks is, there are fewer ""people of reason"" than there are people who are like miss my-way-or-the-highway in your post."
"To be fair the scientific method shows correlation, not causation - so at root there is opinion involved albeit an educated one. 


Also, it is an ""optical illusion,"" an illusion being something which involves deception. So, for her to say ""it is a trick"" is an entirely accurate statement. "
"Not from modern day monkeys, but if we were to hop in a time machine and meet our ancient ancestors, we'd probably take one look at them and think ""yep, that's a monkey."""
That's actually a very bad way to put it, because it implies that monkeys/ apes are our direct ancestors
"It's not ""their own definition"", it's the colloquial definition. Unsurprisingly, it can confuse people when the same word means two completely different things. "
Well, to be fair, it isn't actually *proven* but majorly backed up. I believe it to be true with all my heart, but it isn't absolutely proven. That said, people shouldn't argue that it's not true based of off no facts.
"people like to confuse theory and hypothesis

for clearification: A theory is a thesis, an idea (of someone, laid out in terms with definite meaning) if you will, which SO FAR could not be disproofen by scientific research/tests, studies, logic or whatsoever.

for it to become fact a statement must be true.

that is at least how I understood it, correct me if I'm wrong."
A theory can NEVER become fact.  And it is absolute FACT that evolution occurs.  That's not the theory at all.  It's very easy to prove evolution occurs.  The THEORY states that all life on Earth has a common ancestor and that the differences are the result of evolution.
"The problem with things that happens over millions of years is that it is kind of hard to make ""testable experimentation"" that simulate this in a human lifetime. Sure you can observe/test the nature over a short amount of time and then extrapolate your observations. Is this reasonable? probably! I won't argue against it. But this is usually where creationists would say that there is a difference between ""real science"" and ""evolution""."
"My dad is a scientist and has *always* corrected my sister and I when we do this. You know how some parents reply to ""me and so-and-so..."" with ""so-and-so and I""? That's my dad with theory and hypothesis. "
"""It's a good job gravity is a law or we'd see Christians just floating on down the street"" - Marc Maron (paraphrased)"
I may be wrong, but isn't everything still a theory? Even gravity, the fact that the Earth rotates, etc.
I'm not sure if I'm right about this, but the only difference between a law and a theory is that a law is supported by math, but a theory is by observation and experimentation. I get aggravated when people think that 'theory' is synonymous with 'hunch'
Well, to be fair, even though it's backed by cumulative supporting scientific evidence, that evidence is still not yet sufficient enough to conclude definitively that evolution is the only explanation for our being here. It's not yet a fact.
Religion is always going to put its sticks of faith into the spokes of science. But hopefully as time goes on it will eventually be looked at the same way Greek mythology is now. 
"tbh there is not testable experimentation on evolution. There is copious amounts of evidence, but it speaks just as well for Intelligent design. When your snapshot of history is so insignificantly small that all long-term change can be approximated to zero, all you can have are assumptions. And when everyone starts to assume the same thing, then you assume that as fact and go on to another assumption.

Static universe, miasmatic disease theory, geocentric universe, the aether medium, 4 humors, phlogiston, and -- most importantly for this discussion -- spontaneous generation. All obviously wrong in the present, but upheld in the past by science.

widely held scientific beliefs are often superseded/modified as time goes on. Being ignorant goes both ways. "
Actually, I'm an atheist, but I think your wrong about this one. We only have observations, you can't exactly test evolution. So far it's the best explanation we have, so I'm willing to buy it, but having a fucking rage quit over someone else's opinion is silly imho.
"I'm not trying to start a heated debate here, but I don't agree with evolution. First of all, the chance of some ""random"" mutation coincidentally working in a creature's favor just doesn't seem likely. Second, a change of *kinds* is not observable. It breaks the rules of the scientific method. I'm not talking a change of kinds like finch to different finch. I'm talking fish to reptile, reptile to bird, etc"
but its still a Theory because there are also experiments and observations that point to it being untrue.. like for instance an human body that was carbon dated to the Jurassic.... wait what????
That's because Gravity is a Law, but *how it works* is a theory.  This is an invalid analogy my friend.  Please, try again some other time.
So sort of like my analogy. We had a common ancestor and then we branched off in different directions?
"When I said that the argument sounded stupid, I was referring to the ""If evolution is real why are there still monkeys?"" The question itself is not stupid, but it is usually used as a rhetorical question intended to ""disprove"" evolution. "
"Okay then, just an irritable science geek, then. I'm not ""trying to seem"" anything. If anything, I'd like to make it clear that I'm pretty intolerant of people who *have to* be right all the time, and can't just let others have their little 'ignorant' fantasies."
I might just be old, but evolution was not taught in school where I was as fact, so not everyone does it out of self imposition. It was mentioned as a plausible possibility.
Ding! it's this way in the states. It's easier to become part of the Foster system and Adopt, then just straight Adopt a kid.

"There was some controversy about the way the experiment was performed, not everyone was in total agreement with the findings. But there have been many other studies performed that have come to similar conclusions. IIRC, the effect on adults is more short-term and acute/exaggerated, and more long-term in children. But again, this isn't a ""sole factor"" thing. (Violent video games does not equal school shootings, just that it's a ""risk factor"".)"

Usually the tropical punch packs share the box with strawberry flavored packs. You can give me all your strawberry gushers if you want.
You're probably buying the strawberry/tropical combo packs. Shit infuriates me too. Check the back of the wrapper. It's printed on there.
If it happens a lot, contact the manufacturer. You'll need the lot number from the box, usually printed in small black letters on the bottom or side of the box. At worst, you'll get a few coupons. At best, they'll actually find a problem and fix it for future production runs.
For me it's more towards people who I know get unreasonably angry really fast. These days I do still say calm down, but its so we can have an adult conversation. If they still want to scream and yell. I just stop talking and ignore them. 
Use too do that all the time to my Mum. The best even though was someone had really offended her at work when we worked at the same place. She started getting really made. Someone said Calm down. She go so much more angry and I broke out in laughter. 
"And again, I don't get a straight answer to my question. :-(

You bring up good points, though. It's essentially like treating someone like they're five, and that in itself is infuriating. However, I was raised to believe that yelling, screaming, slamming doors, kicking inanimate objects or generally being rough & noisy with those objects, ect., are not appropriate ways of showing anger, especially around others. Go ahead and do that in your own space on your own time. So, to me, when other adults do those things around me, they're acting like they're have one digit for an age. Not only are they making me angry unnecessarily, they're acting like children and I can't take them seriously until they calm down. See my problem?

I also feel that saying things like ""take a deep breath"" or ""go into the other room"" are probably on par with saying ""calm down."" I just don't know what to do in those (admittedly, rare) situations other than say ""Leave. You're pissing me off."" And that response probably doesn't help much, either."

The problem is THAT girl always has a group of friends that feed her head, telling her for years that she's a great singer.
Mine wasn't even a good singer.  And she ended up going to college for it.  Someone should have told her.

Most of the time it's just humming under my breath, though. And often I don't even realize I'm doing it. But I'm definitely that person that, should you say something that reminds me of a song, I'm gonna sing that phrase.  I'm sorry. "
I know that girl, except she's tone deaf. Literally. And she knows. But she keeps singing anyway. And it's bad music. I think I might kill her. *twitch*
You essentially just described my HS Calc/Physics/Chem teacher. He has a mole puppet, sings songs about science and math, and has characters that he plays to help reinforce the material. It really works, too, everybody who takes his classes loves him and he's one of the school's best teachers.

An ex-neighbour of mine had a young female relative who visited from time to time. She took singing lessons of some description, but was by no means talented. She would insist on public performances of pop songs, sang in a ridiculous over-warbled out of tune style in the street out front. Fuck it used to be annoying. She was absolutely certain that sooner or later some passing scout would discover her and she would be famous.
"I have slight red-green colour deficiency. I used to do land surveying, and the guy i did it with used a red pencil to mark a tiny ""x"" on the sidewalk which i would have to spot from 2 blocks away. It was really hard to find because the red blended in with the grey/brown sidewalk. So I asked him to switch to a blue pencil. Oh course he made a big deal about my ""colour blindness"" and blah blah blah. But I could see the blue pencil mark just fine and had no troubles when he used it. But when we would switch roles, he would also ask me to use the red pencil, because he couldnt see the blue mark very well!

People with ""normal"" colour vision see red very very strongly. Imagine a strong florescent red. That is how ""normal"" colour vision people see normal red all the time. Its why they mark important things in red. Stop signs, and fire extinguishers, and exit signs, and red pens for underlining mistakes. Red stands out for them way more than the other colours. People with red-green colour blindness see colours more evenly, we can see red, it just doesnt jump out that much. Personally I like that and am happy with my vision. We are also much better at spotting people wearing camouflage, and colour blind people were used for that in WW2. There may be an evolutionary adaptation favouring colour blindness, which is why its more common in men (who were the hunters).

Because you look like a creep if you go up to every girl and start by asking 'Hey, you have a boyfriend?

"If my friends and family are to be believed, I snore *a lot*. And I get really drowsy sometimes.

A few people have questioned my morals and possibly found my story to have traces of racism in it, it did, and I'm disappointed in myself because 95% of me hates racism, or any other form of prejudice, but I still know I can justify myself when I behave/think/or talk in racism and so I'm not that ashamed. I feel that you and I feel the same way about this subject and I'm sorry to hear that you can relate, even more so for your girlfriend. Dw futiledevices I understand, and some boyfriends/fathers/mothers/brothers/best friends or whatever, may not feel that much hurt from this happening to a loved one, but for me it hurt because I'm that kind of guy and I love her.

Btw there was another reply to this comment I think, and he seems to have the same problem, maybe message him too?"
Because that's what she told me, I hope no offence came from this, I don't have racist feelings towards anyone with an aboriginal heritage, only from where I came from, but that's from experience I guess and I don't deny it. Its difficult to explain, but in any case I detest hate towards somebody for reasons they can't control, such as racism or religion or gender or any of that stuff.
That's a tricky one man, and I don't have enough life experience to empathise I'm sorry, but in any case I sincerely hope he never hurts her again, and I hope that you find your way too. It's probably best to not hear from her again in case he hasn't changed, and someone closer to her can help console her, if you get dragged back into it you will probably be affected very dramatically emotionally, I'm not saying leave her behind to her own problems, but let her decide where her life and your life still connect. Basically I don't want you to constantly be the rebound guy.

"Now here's my thought, yes it's all protected under free speech, but would it be against the constitution to make a law that will limit whoever is allowed at emotional functions such as that?  Such as wedding's or funerals, those are obvious times of excitement or trauma for some people, would it be wrong to say that they aren't allowed there due to it still being a private function?  Or maybe even that it has high emotions that can easily excite someone to violence without as much cause as normal?

I know if my uncle or brother or cousin had died in a war, killed off by a gun or bomb because of what I believe wasn't necessary, I would be extremely upset, I'd be crying, and angry that they are gone.  To put on top of it someone telling me my brother, who I loved very much, is going to hell for being a murderer, after I remember him as a hero, I know he can't defend himself anymore, so I will.  Even if not violent, but after taking offense, they get more aggressive, standing very close, shoving signs in my face under the protection of ""free speech,"" is that not harassment?

I understand why they are protected, and we can't fully take away their right to that, as much as I would love to.  But would it be out of the question to pass a law limiting where they can protest?  Just due to either harassment or indecency laws, not due to what they are saying.  It's a system they abuse to prey on people who are already weak, and there must be some way to rule that as illegal, probably not a crime, but some way for a police officer to say ""move along"" at least, get rid of the problem before it starts.

If bars can kick people out when the patrons begin yelling in order to avoid the fight, why can't we avoid the fight in the first place in public?

That's now how it works. Here's a good explanation from [Angela Gassow , Arch Enemy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCMcu18sigc&sns=em)
Sure but have you ever listened to a lot of rap music? I'm familiar with a lot of it because I do in fact like 90s gangster rap. Mainstream rap that a lot of young people listen to is all about partying, smoking weed, sex, etc. It just gets really old after a while. Then you have these people that act like I'm some sort of weirdo because I don't listen to that.

But then you'll kill all business and hurt the job creators that just gave themselves another multimillion dollar raise!  
"Because if you raise the minimum wage, the costs of everything goes up, and it would hurt the small businesses who would lose money the most. Then all those said businesses start hiring people on part time instead of full time to pay them less, all while everyone else not on minimum wage in the end makes less money because their pay wouldn't go up.

It's not black and white."
Yeah and then businesses will fire all their lowest paid workers because they can't afford to pay the stupidly high minimum wage.

"Well, yeah, that's kind of the point of feminism. Feminists fight for gender equality by focusing on women's issues, while men's rights activists focus on issues that affect men. No feminist actually wants to take away any of the rights that men have. There are some extremists, but they are in the minority.


Feminists and MRAs (as with feminism, there are quite a few extremists in this group, but they are in the minority) are on the same side. They're just fighting different battles."
That's just not accurate.  Feminism (to the majority of those who identify as feminists) is equality.  I want everyone to have the same opportunities, and if I were to see a situation where men were treated unfairly because of their sex, I'd stand against it.

These people are the ones that are ""possibly not X"", and you and I agree that they are probably not X(but importantly, not necessarily not X). The point I was making was just that (not obviously disabled ≠ obviously not disabled). A statement of that formula groups those who are disabled in non-obvious ways in with those assholes, which is a definite disservice. I know that this happens in both the US and Canada, with many people holding a turn-of-the-century definition of disability, wherein only the visibly crippled are actually disabled.

My point was not to suggest that you are the sort of asshole who makes/believes this demonstrably illogical claim, but rather to show why it is a) illogical and b) potentially harmful.

"Yes, I got through college on scholarships, jobs, and very little help from my family, and at times, things were tough, but it was still magic fairy land.

Once you grow up and have kids, or hell, not even your own, maybe a nephew or niece, or some of your friends have kids, you may begin to understand. Otherwise, you should drop the judgement and show some grace. You can make the world a little bit better by not giving eat shit looks, sighs, and eye rolls to the parents who already feel bad about their kid melting down...especially when all they are trying to do is continuing enjoying a sense of normalcy. I know for me that my son is great 95% of the time, but when he has had a meltdown (rarely happens, maybe twice) that I feel bad. That doesn't remove me from the opportunity to give my wife a break from taking care of the house and cleaning, to model to my son what it looks like to care for his mother, and to take time to enjoy what I work my ass off for every day, which partly is the opportunity to enjoy a steak while my son gets a shot at some sweet chicken tenders and veggies. Be a part of the solution, and don't get wrapped up in something just because of your immaturity.  Don't wait to understand, start showing grace so you don't feel like an idiot when its your kid having a rough day."
" > there are feminists who hates men

I classify those as radical feminists, or radfems.  Personally, I'm a feminist, but I consider myself an egalitarian feminist, which is what I understand mainstream feminism to be.  

I think part of the problem is that the name is confusing, and implies superiority of women.  When feminism solved its initial goals of voting rights and certain other legal rights, the movement didn't just dissolve, it just refocused its goals.  

I think that the focus of mainstream feminism now is more toward social equality than legal equality, even though there is room for both.  They butt heads with the MRA groups often enough, and that is partly because there are ""haters"" in each group, partly because the focus is in a different spot (many in both groups want equality, but have a different starting point), and partly due to differing definitions and understandings of words and issues.

Inequality abounds, though, so I'm fine with anyone who is working toward ending it, even if its from a different starting point and with a different focus.  People sometimes get so involved in their own battles, though, that they tend to diminish the battles of others."
"Those people aren't feminists, despite what they may think. 

I'd say to even be a feminist you need promote that men aren't all mindless rapists and have the capacity to take responsibility for their own actions. "

Well, children don't (and shouldn't) have the same rights as adults.  Their brains aren't fully developed yet.  But, self-defense is a right they should have, just like the rest of us.
Makes me wonder if school bullies often grow up to be School Administrators and secretly hold a pro-Bully agenda.
"One time when my cousin was 3 a group of  27 rusky mob enforcers attempted to attacked the owner of his daycare with an arsenal of chains, ball bats, butterfly knives, tridents, fully automatic machine guns, acid, raptors, chinese finger traps and some other shit , i cant remember. Anyways he punched all of their heads off, blood everywhere. His mom was all like, ""thats whats up""."
Indeed, I always tell my kids that if they are defending themselves or others, they will never be in trouble at home.  Just yesterday, there was a kid at our high school that killed themselves :-(  The note child left cited bullying as the cause for their depression.  It's not even in the paper yet or I'd link the article.  Our society has created the perfect environment for bullies to thrive.  Our kids are told to never get physical, if they defend, they will face punishment!  When I was a kid, I punched the bully in his nose, and he thought twice before picking on people again!
I wasn't there, so I can't comment on what actually happened, but I'd like to think that he saw the situation develop, and saw that the children were policing themselves, and felt that his intervention wasn't needed.  I'm sure if the situation had escalated, he would have stepped in.
Even if the counselor did witness it, the most he could have done was send them to the principal or something or issue a detention and ask them why they felt that they had to do that.  If the kids don't give a shit about being in trouble (a ton of them dont) then the even taking action on a teacher's part means literally nothing.
"We actually do have a zero tolerance policy on bullying, and it does tie the hands of the administrators foolish enough to believe it's the answer to the problem.  We are just lucky enough to have a few good people spread throughout the school system that understand how life actually works.  I've been to countless school board meetings to champion the repeal of the zero tolerance policy.  (Taken a hell of a lot of heat for it, and even lost some friends as well)  It's hard for people to understand, that zero tolerance actually empowers most bullies, unless they hear it from their kids directly or witness it's failure first hand.  

It blows my mind how, in just one generation, people can forget what they went through as kids.  How those experiences made them stronger, more mature people as a result.  I read that story about that young lady, who picked her drunk friend up from a party after work.  She didn't consume anything, just gave her friend a lift to prevent a possible DUI/accident situation.  Police happened to show while she was there, she gets slammed by the school system for breaking the zero tolerance policy.  Lost her captain's spot on the volleyball team, suspended too IIRC.  For what?  Making sure her friend didn't hurt herself/someone else?  WTF is up with that, how can we live in a society where helping people may get you in trouble?  SMH"
I'm not surprised that he did it, I'm surprised he did it at 12 and not say 13-14.  A year makes a big difference!
Once I got taller than everyone else, I stopped getting picked on, but I had more people try to push me into fights. Apparently they want to look tough to their friends.
Funny how either getting really big or kicking someone else's ass tends to set people straight, isn't it?
"Because I believe the thinking is that you shouldn't have to defend yourself if you did nothing wrong. Like it's somehow your fault for being bullied.

Same idea that goes into victim blaming for someone who's been raped.

Being vulnerable apparently makes you just as guilty in the schools eye.

I am worried for my kids with how many schools treat students. "
The problem is not that bullshittery is legal, it is that fixing bullshittery and stupidness is often charged with murder.
I know, right?! Also, that administrator is so stupid he probably would have punished her for running away. Idiot. 
This is complete and utter bullshit.  I would appeal to the court purely out of principal.  How can such a policy be legal is beyond me.  Gah!
"Legal reasons. Even if the administrator felt that the deaf girl retaliating by right-crossing the kid in the throat would have been the best of all possible outcomes (and it probably would have been), the kid's parents, being the type of people that raised a kid that hits deaf people, could file legal action against the school and the girl if the original assailant was injured. Probably wouldn't have happened, but blanket policies exist for a reason.

Is it fair? Of course not. But for a less extreme example, imagine Kid A taking a swing at Kid B for whatever dumb reason kids punch each other. Kid B punches back, and Kid A falls and hits his head on the back of a desk and sustains a concussion and brain damage. Maybe fighting back was the only option, and maybe Kid B had been tormented by Kid A. If an administrator doesn't act entirely impartial and doesn't suspend or take appropriate corrective action against Kid B, Kid A's lawyer declares that the school was sanctioning violence or somehow protecting a kid who (however inadvertently) inflicted serious harm on another, and probably tips a lawsuit against the school in their favor. Now every student and faculty member suffers as a result of a financially damaging lawsuit. "
This is the public school system. Anyone that subjects their children to it is either insane, evil, or just fucking stupid.
My brain imagined this, causing me to laugh, which thankfully is keeping me from being pissed all day about this.

WW2 was an example of Hitler resorting to violence to solve a problem. Everything that came from that was predicated on the resorting to violence. Therefore the better example would be ""What was the better answer to the social and economic issues of Germany, non violent planning or engaging in a world spanning crippling war"" in which case you come up with the correct conclusion of violence not being the answer. 

It doesn't mean you don't defend yourself, but that the actions of the defense are also created by the resorting to violence and all the total violence created from both the offense and the defense are caused by using that resort."

"I call this ""Traffic Herding"". On any long road trip (200+ miles), if you are a speeder (guilty) you will start to notice them. You will go through huge lengths virtually alone, and then spend 30 minutes trapped in a herd of slow drivers. You can usually even tell the ONE CAR that is causing the situation, and once you pass that car; all alone again."
"Hence ""unintentionally"" 

As soon as I realized that I was doing what I hate other people doing, I slowed down to let them pass. 

I am a very active driver, so that hardly ever happened in the first place, but it'd be where I was going 60 for no reason and the person passing me was going 70. I'd end up passing them because I drive 75+ mostly, but I needed to fall behind instead of what would look like racing them. If that makes sense. "
He's not talking about the passing lane, he's talking about the merge lane and the people who wait until it runs out to move into traffic.
It's the land of the magical 75 mph speed limit. After driving that for a couple years, you get in a bit of a hurry. Everywhere you go.
You must have not driven in Colorado Springs then because half of these drivers are boneheads. Denver isn't bad though
Ironically, whenever I get stuck behind someone merging into traffic at half the speed everyone else is moving, it's a NJ driver.
Didn't see that at all on my drive home. I wouldn't doubt it at that exit though, Washington Ave. can get a little hectic with merging and exiting. 
"The same logic can be thrown your way, if absolute immersion is so important why not save your money and not go to the movie theatres. That way you can watch a stream 3-4 weeks later with a pair blinders on alone in a dark room.

Listen, the fact of the matter is that the movie theatres is full of people and so you're going to have to live with the minor distractions, like crunching of popcorn, slurping a drink, the occasional whisper and texting with the brightness turned all the way down. If your going to complain about the tiny things of course you're not going to enjoy the movie and you're just one step away from yelling some kids to get off your lawn. "

"Yes, or in this case the cost of a movie ticket. For two people to go see a movie on a premium screen with popcorn and drinks you're looking at around $60.


In case people are doubting me, where I live in Australia the average movie ticket price is $15, and on average a large popcorn/drink combo is pretty close to $15 as well. I can spend $60 for my wife and I to enjoy a film on the big screen, $35-40 to buy it on a bluray, or I can download it. Great options, arent they?"

Whether you read recreationally or not has little bearing on intelligence. I'm doing a PhD in English, and I haven't read a book for fun in years. It's too much like work.

do you seriously think anyone who has the ability to read is in all sincerity hating the fact that they have such an ability?  really??  you mad bro???"
Doesn't read. He's literate and he's not stupid - he's recently written a business plan for a cider making business he's starting. He just doesn't read fiction, and is proud of this. I've even tried suggesting some books I think would interest him, based on what he likes to watch, but he won't.
This happens at my work all the time! People almost proudly tell me they are computer illiterate and have no idea what they are doing. Like it's an adorable quality or something. It's not. You're either unwilling to learn or you're just dumb.
"you are forgetting an entire generation, in fact probably a generation and a half, that were well into adulthood before the first computers came into the home. These people have IN NO WAY grown up learning to use computers, and were introduced to them at an age where learning to use them did not come naturally.

So yea, a different set of rules apply to a decent portion of society as a whole. "
But they still exist, TestZero's claim is that it's the same like being illiterate and it's simply not. 
"I think it will go even beyond that. People will be using technology more than reading, and I bet there will be people who can use tech that cannot read and write so well.

Also, on the same tack, perhaps there will be less truly illiterate people, as technology gives them an increased impetus to read."
Much appreciated. Very few things bother him, so we're usually pretty good. However, when we get around loud chewers and/or people that chew with open mouths, he gets visibly upset almost instantly. We have stopped having meals with two of our close friends because of this alone. I'm beginning to think he may have a mild case of Misophonia. 
I hope he contacted everyone that instead of just you or that is kind of dickish. At least he did tell you beforehand....I got to find out many hours later.
"Well, see you had a better excuse than blowing off someone for something more interesting. I would gather you probably were running on less sleep and eventually it caught up to you. It happens to the best of us. In your shoes, I probably would have just called when I woke up and explained and not shown up....this mostly goes into the fact I find it a bit rude to show up past 10-11pm. This might come from the fact most everyone I know lives in apartments and I figure have guests appear at that time at night is probably going to annoy their neighbors - also knowing the people I hang out with who work day shifts, they are either getting ready to go to bed within the hour or are already asleep.

The person I'm referring to in my story was barely getting in part-time hours. It also wasn't the first time she had been insanely late, but was the first time she blew me off completely. Interestingly enough not the reason the friendship ended."
"True, but there is a line between ""casual"" and ""disrespect"" which should have been worked out long ago between friends.  

For me, that line is notification.

You say 10mins and then don't respond for 50mins?  I was ready and waiting for 40mins and am pissed.  

I don't care if you are gonna be late to ""random bullshit evening #536"", I care that you didn't let me know and left me in limbo.  "
You should have just found a point in time to 'accidentally' spill some wine on him, he wouldnt want to propose with stains on his shirt!  If that doesnt work, just hire one of the best men to rough him up in the parking lot, he can propose once he gets to the hospital.
"Yeah. I can only imagine how distracting weddings can be. The whole ""you probably won't even get a piece of your own cake"" phenomena."
It was one of those 'let's get engaged, but not get married for a few more years' deal, but it was still awkward.
"Reminds me of the final season of 30Rock. 

Someone tries to have a surprise wedding, during other weddings, and parties, and shows, and funerals, and I think at a birthday party."
No apparently she was often like that. She liked to be the centre of attention. I have a number of Polish friends who thought it was an odd thing to do so I don't believe it to be a cultural thing either.
I can agree with that, but in my case - I don't think anyone really knew yet.  I wasn't terribly upset, my wedding was still fucking awesome.
This would definitely be excellent justice! If it's been enough years, them announcing plans to renew their vows might be enough as well.
"It seems to me such a personal thing between two individuals that it would be better to ask in private, then when the question is answered, display the ring, gush to your friends and family, and have everyone all happy and talking about it after the commitment has been made.

"I think there's nothing wrong with being a little high maintenance for something so important and memorable.

Also, the world may not care, but my family and friends totally will and they're the ones that are really important to me. :)"
also, I feel I should mention, not that it really matters, but if he were to decide on a more private proposal I'm sure I will still love it because he knows me well enough to knock my socks off no matter how he does it. Plus either way I end up marrying the man of my dreams so it's really a win-win. :D
"My thing is, I'd love it to be at a place that means a lot to us as a couple. There are quite a few different places that have had a big impact on our relationship (the place we met, which is also the place I first asked him out, the place we went on our first date and also celebrated our 6 mon and 1 year anniversary, etc) It doesn't need to be super public, and I'd rather be surrounded by all my friends, who I am super close to. Especially because my friends jokingly ask all the time when it's finally going to happen (in a pleasant way, not in the overbearing way) so I know they will all be as thrilled as I am. :D

And like I said, we both know we're going to get married and have kids and so on and so forth, so the proposal is pretty much a really awesome formality and sign that we're ready to start actually planning the wedding. "
"Well, I'm certainly glad to hear that you know what a wedding is for, and if you enjoy weddings then even better! What I was referring to was more about the stigma that huge fancy ""traditional"" weddings are how it's *supposed to be*, that anything less means they must not be that committed, or must not love each other much."
Well, hopefully if you are your friends are already prepared for it, you can help scoop him up off the ground when he needs it. From the sounds of it, he's going to be needing you guys in the relatively near future! Maybe have a plan on how to help cheer him up! (although I would recommend never telling him you planned on the divorce. Just sayin'.)
Also, I feel I must mention this also. Proposal at a wedding is bad enough. An unwanted proposal can downright ruin the evening. 
Weirdly enough, this is the only thing I'm super crazy about. I'm actually kin of secretly hoping that my future MiL will plan most of the wedding with/for me. And I have no personal experience with it which I suppose is also weird, it just REALLY bothers me.
"Maybe 5 minutes at the *time*, but everyone would forever remember YOUR wedding as ""That wedding where the Jim & Nancy got engaged"". Everyone will remember that part of it above anything else, and thus the other couple has effectively stolen your day. "
I used to work with a guy who had the genetic, baggy, super dark eyes. I felt bad for him because every time he met someone new, they'd ask if he got in a fight. Seriously looked like two black eyes.
I'm saying I wouldnt be friends with someone who reminds me of an embarrassing red blemish on my face. I know that you are trying to be helpful, but don't you think if you are able to notice it, they have already noticed it?

"I have cut and pasted pieces of this image myself, in photoshop, to prove that it is correct, and yet there's a part of my brain that refuses to accept it.

Meaning, I seem to be under the impression that if I am aware of the ""trick"", I should be able to force myself to see the squares as the same color, despite the layout of the original image.  And yet I cannot, I cannot, I cannot.  I stare at this goddamn image forever and never will those two squares look like the same color.

Maybe my failure is because they will NEVER ""look"" like the same color *in the context of that image*.  Is that it?  Can anyone ""see"" them as the same once they know they *are* the same?

The broader question, I guess, is to what degree can you unfuck your brain from seeing things the way it's programmed to see things?"
They look the same when I tilt my laptop screen back and cover up some of the surrounding squares. I think your screen has a lot to do with it
My mind is blown.. I am not going to fight with Photoshop. But how? They don't even slightly resemble each other! And shouldn't the white square down and left from B also be the same as it is in the cylinder's shadow?

"bah... evolution being evolution is not an opinion.

But an analysis of data IS an opinion, if you can find a fact in science that has never changed, then you don't study science, you study expert opinion.

Though the ""It is just an opinion"" greatly over simplifies the process, saying ""It isn't an opinion"" seems to imply it is irrefutable. The point is that GOOD (Not all) science is a bunch of people getting together, making educated assumptions and comparing that assumption against other assumptions. Every time two assumptions agree, it adds more validity to those two assumptions.  Every once in awhile something happens that completely changes beliefs/assumptions. After the previous presumptions are refuted, what are the old assumptions that were originally part of scientific cannon called? what were they to begin with? what word would you use to describe them?

The point is that science is educated guesses, human limitations prevent us from becoming more than that.

Anyway, people who think 'science' isn't a human invention and assume it to be some sort of almost metaphysical separate entity get my goat :-)"

">To be fair the scientific method shows correlation, not causation

To be fair: wrong. 

""There are three conditions that must be present to show causality: 1) there must be a strong correlation between the proposed cause and effect, 2) the proposed cause must precede the effect in time, and 3) the cause has to be present whenever the effect occurs (Burns & Grove, 2001, p. 791).""

[The three stipulations get repeated occasionally in scientific papers to establish how causality is shown using the scientific method.](http://www.instituteofmidwifery.org/MSFinalProj.nsf/82fd56378e8efc3c8525684f005bc9f1/fa989b28c2a3301a85256a0000560613?OpenDocument)

Once something is repeated with a high enough level of confidence, it is established as a fact. A group of observed falsifiable facts that explain a bigger truth with nothing to say otherwise at present will form a theory. If something is repeatedly observed but it's not known why it happens, it becomes a law. These are the specific definitions used in science; layman terms that equivocate on this aren't used in science because that would unnecessarily confuse matters (see: people that think evolution ""is just a [theory](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/theory?show=0&t=1382453706)"", using the ""conjecture"" definition of the word (definition #6.b in the Merriam-Webster dictionary) as opposed to ""observable things that explain a larger truth"" meaning (primary definition, same dictionary))."
"That doesn't matter. The point is to counter the root error.

**The survival of an ancestor does not preclude the existence of descendants.** That's the relevant point because that is the lame argument trying to be made... that the existence of a descendant means the ancestors can't be around any more.

If you start talking about cousins you just muddy the water. The question assumes that somehow, evolution means the previous versions must completely disappear... which makes no sense for the same reason that my birth did not cause my grandparents to disappear.

Seriously, asking them about their own family tree and who is still alive is an infinity better way of engaging their critical thinking than calling them monkeys or trying to explain where splits in the primate family tree happened. Start small and personal and undeniable."
Well, I was sweating and getting red in the face, my hand was shaking and my morning coffee spilling out of the cup. I was gritting my teeth and made the **AaaaaaGGGGGGG&HHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!** sound OUT LOUD. 
"It very well may be the colloquial definition that many people use, but it's still wrong. People who use the colloquial definition to describe science are not only ignorant,  but proud of it.

This situation,  to me,  is synonymous with someone writing a rude, terrible review of a film, musical work, or piece of literature without even looking at them before submitting the review. 

I'm legitimately furious at these kinds of people. There's no excuse to make a statement about which you know nothing about. If you don't know what you're talking about, you can't have an informed opinion. If you can't make an informed opinion, then say ""I don't know."" 

If you don't know if your opinion is informed, then test your beliefs by research and try to learn more about the subject which you have an opinion on. It's very simple.

If people weren't so satisfied about what they think they believe is true, we wouldn't have so many people prancing around believing themselves to be informed. Uncertainty is okay, people. Uncertainty is the best friend of science and scientists. 

Be humble and have humility. If you don't know about something, then it's okay to ask stupid questions but if you do, don't get butt-hurt when the real answer differs from your warped conception of what's true. 
"
"Believing evolution is true is exactly like believing in the mail system.  It's entirely unnecessary if you understand it.  You don't have to believe that the mailman exists.  You just have to go say hello to him.  The only ""belief"" that comes into play is that the processes that are currently occurring have been occurring in the past for a long time."
The idea of evolution itself goes against the very nature of science. Evolution is, more or less, an *assumption.* I'm not talking fossils or ancestors or whatever. I want an example if evolution happening that I could observe within my lifetime. Not over billions of years. Evolution is *not* observable. It doesn't follow the scientific method and, therefore, is not valid
But then why aren't they arguing against erosion forming the Grand Canyon?  Or volcanoes forming the Hawaiian chain of islands?  We can LITERALLY watch that happening, but we didn't see it start.  The ONLY reason people are arguing against evolution and not those is because it disagrees with a 5000 year old myth.
"Thing is ""gravity"" isn't a law.  It's actually less understood and less well supported than evolution.  There ARE laws to the theory of gravity, but they are mathematical equations that work to explain gravity (well between big things, not between small things)."
You are correct.  Theories don't become facts any more than stories become characters.  Facts are the supporting evidence.  Theories are the explanations.
">evidence is still not yet sufficient enough

Let me refer you to [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_for_evolution) and [this](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/). Out of all scientific theories, evolution may well be the most well-supported in history, and biological scientists aren't yet done finding new information.

Additionally, evolution is *both* a [fact and a theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_as_fact_and_theory). 

It's a fact that 1) generations of species [differ genetically](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_inheritance) from the previous and subsequent generations, 2) species [change gradually](http://www.evolution-textbook.org/content/free/figures/ch15.html) over time even without speciation, 3) one species can give rise to multiple species in [speciation](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB910.html), 4) environments exerts a [preferential selection](http://www.avibushistoriae.com/Darwin_finches.dis2.jpg) for individuals [most well-adapted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s_finches) to those environments, and 5) [all organisms](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Phylogenetic_tree.svg) share [common ancestry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_ancestor). Therefore, it is a fact some form of evolution occurs.

It's a theory because we're not completely, 100% sure on *how* evolution happens. There's a dizzying array of mechanisms for evolution, including (but not limited to): [punctuated equilibrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium), [gradualism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic_gradualism), [genetic drift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift), [natural selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), [sexual selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection), [sexual conflicts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_conflict), and [lateral gene transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_gene_transfer). It could be one of them, or a combination of multiple mechanisms by which species evolve."
">There is copious amounts of evidence, but it speaks just as well for intelligent design.

No, it doesn't. If you support intelligent design you have to, simultaneously, realize how unintelligent and ineffective it is in practice. Consider the hundreds of millions of species that are extinct and that 99.8% of all the species that ever lived on Earth are now extinct. That's pretty intelligent design, not considering that 97% of the volume of the universe will kill you instantly. 

"
"> widely held scientific beliefs are often superseded/modified as time goes on.

But Intelligent Design is a religous claim.  The conclusion was reached first, then the search for evidence began.  Evidence against it is ignored, and evidence for it is kept.  This makes it seem like there is plenty of good evidence for it.

With evolution, the conclusion was reached **after** the evidence was gathered.

Basically, there is no emotional attachment to evolution.  It's just science.  On the other hand, creationists are too emotionally attached to ID to consider that it is not true.
"
"Absolutely ridiculous.  It does not at ALL support intelligent design.  If you found irreducible complexity, then it might, but as of yet, no one has found it.  At all.

"Your being an atheist has no relevance. Evolution and religion are not mutually exclusive in the sense that religious people can still choose to be right or wrong about evolution. 

I don't have a ""rage quit"" because of a person's opinion. I rage at their lack of education and their wallowing in ignorance. I despise the idea that the people's educators, friends, family, parents, and mentors have the power to deny children the ability to reason and think for themselves. If you are scientifically illiterate and don't take science seriously, it's because you've been taught the same reasoning deficiencies propogated by the adults in your life during your childhood. 

Science is a process of systematic reasoning. It's how we find out the processes that drive our universe. A person who trivializes science and reasoning is not a person that has an opinion worth hearing.

It isn't likely. Far more non-beneficial mutations occur than beneficial ones. And you don't seem to clearly understand evolution.
"**Your statement is opprobrious and worthy of scorn.**

This is an extremely ignorant statement. Carbon dating doesn't work past ~50,000 years. The Jurassic occurred between 201.3 - 145.0 million years ago. 

You have no idea how dating techniques work so please refrain from making such ridiculous comments. Even the earliest of modern humans didn't show up until about 150,000 to 250,000 years ago. "
"**Geologist here!**

>you can get good guesses and what probably happened, but you can't actually prove the earth is millions of years old since we can't observe the earth millions of years ago

The statement that you just made above is a blatant disregard for scientific fact and evidence. We know that the earth is 4.55 billion of years old because of techniques used in radiometric dating, specifically U^238 --Pb^206 radioactive decay. The half life of U^238 is ~4.5 billion years. In rocks, we analyze the ratios of U and Pb to determine the relative ages of their constituent rocks. Today, our analysis of these U^238 -bearing rocks shows that there is just under 50% of the original U^238 remaining in these rocks that would have been present within them  during their formation. This means the U^238 has gone through just over one half life. Thus, we know the age of the Earth and of the age of the formation of our solar system to be 4.55 billion years old. 

We also have the support of geologic processes which would not be able to occur without the presence of large amounts of time. The oldest rocks exposed on the Earth's surface are those that are exposed in the African craton (the oldest piece of crust that surfaced during the Earth's formation). This craton is upwards of 2.7 billion years old. The formation of mountains and mountain belts take a great deal of time to form as well.

As for evolution of life: single-celled organisms arose quickly after the formation of RNA and DNA. However, multi-cellular life took much longer to form. You needed the  cyanobacteria to get the oxygen budget going and thus to get sufficient fuel for multi-celled organisms to thrive. 

We know this because of the presence of Banded Iron Formations (BIFs) in the rock record. All of these BIFs formed 2.5 billion years ago from the cyanobacteria which first produced oxygen and released it into the atmosphere. These  cyanobacteria formed structures called stromatolites, which thrived in shallow marine environments. 

The first multi-cellular organisms formed 1 billion years ago. It wasn't really until the Cambrian explosion that biodiversity really skyrocketed. 

The reason why evolution must have been going on for all this time is that the have the evidence of BIFs, fossils, and hundreds of MILLIONS of species that have been intermediaries between different species. **Most importantly, the DNA we have in our cells is the best evidence for evolution. As homo sapiens, we share 33% of our DNA with flowers. We share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees. There is no such thing as scientific coincidence.** Evolution takes very,  very long periods of time to occur, and should be treated as an in-situ (a currently occurring) process. Evolution is actually fact at this point, not a ""theory"" as described by your colloquial definition of theory. 

I work with fossils up to 541 million years old everyday. If you like I can PM you some pictures of these specimens to show you the slight differences that occur in species before they branch of into being classified as a new species. 

I hope my information has been helpful to you.

Pretty much. Humans adapted to living in wide open plains, where running speed and long distance stamina were more useful, and various types of monkeys lived in wooded areas, such as jungles, where long tails and nimbleness were more useful for them.
And the you go through hell. My parents were helping a young mother. She turned out to be an abusive, neglectful, drug addict. They begged CPS to get involved and they didn't until the mother beat the kid bad enough to put him in the hospital (on his first birthday). My parents we not looking to adopt (they are in their 50's with two grown children) but after it became clear she was not going to change. They had to give him back, then we given custody again less than a week later. Then the mother was granted custody while on a locked drug rehab ward after failing ever drug test. My parents have been fighting to get him back, but they were basically told the kid has no rights. They hold out hope, but the mother won't give up her welfare and food stamps.
Yup, they closed all the orphanages down because the foster system ends up being cheaper, despite causing children to have PTSD and other severe mental problems.
Yeah my fiance has had many problems with getting insurance for him and our daughter. Things will hopefully get better soon.

No, I don't. But aren't there always stories in the news about people who didn't take their kids to the doctor and only prayed for God to cure them? I guess maybe something along those lines.
Yes, I'm sure. Most places have it now but it's definitely starting next year, unless you're take your child to a home child care center or one that isn't sponsored by the government.
Got a link to the follow up studies?  I've only heard tersely worded things from psych majors about the Bobo doll experiment and they tended to write off the whole idea because of it.

You and the person who shot it down have equal credibility. If you want to persuade people link to various studies that support your statement. Not, ""well if you look study's say..."" Why would you expect others to do research to support your claim, that is counter intuitive to most of our experience. Link some shit, not cry like a bitch.

"First, acknowledge what is making them upset.  If they're bitching about something as a way to vent, let them vent.  A very useful way to show empathy is to mirror the facial expressions that they are making.  If you're smiling while they're furious, it's just going to piss them off even more. 

Speak in a calm, even tone.  Don't let their behavior affect your attitude.  After a while they'll eventually calm down enough to have an actual conversation.   "
"For what it's worth, my wife is kind of hot-headed sometimes (yes, cliche, but she's a red-head). I usually say something along the lines of ""I realize you're upset and I completely understand what you're upset about but let's try to bring it down a notch and talk about it more calmly.""

Does it work? Sometimes. Even if it doesn't right then, I'll stop talking completely. Won't answer direct questions until she is willing to have a discussion and not a rant. She usually will calm herself and we can move on.

As a someone who considers themself to be reasonable and level-headed, it bothers me when people act like they have a right to throw a tantrum. You want me to take you seriously? Act like a fucking adult."
"I'm seeing that part of the problem here is that you think you are correct in thinking that they should calm down, take a deep breath, or go into another room. By doing this, you're marginalizing something that they clearly care about enough to be upset by. Now, how do you defuse the situation? It depends on how you feel about the person.

Is this someone you care about, and want to help? Get over your preconceptions about acceptable ways to express one's self and be there for them. To address the comment above that you found vague, turn those ideas into statements: ""I can see that this is really bothering you, but I'm having trouble understanding, do you want to try to explain the situation, or do you just need to work through it?""

Is it someone you don't much care about? Leave, or tell them to leave if it's occurring in a space you control. No real point in any other response.

TL;DR: Get over yourself. Your way of handling stress is not the right way for all people. If you really want to help people through their stressful moments, stop judging them for how they are handling it."
"Sometimes you're in the situation where you can't just say ""fuck it"" and walk away.  If you're at work and a customer is upset about something, you have to at least try to calm them down or hand them off to a manager.

"We had special evolutions that took long periods of time. Things like taking on cargo or fuel during an evolution called *underway replenishment*

We had special watch bills for such events. These events could take up to eight hours. If you were on the special watchbill you had to stand the entire 8 hours. So if you had your normal watch before the evolution and then you were on the evolution watch bill you could possibly be on watch for 12 hours.

The galley has specific hours they operate. So if you have the 12 - 04 you can't eat breakfast until after watch when the galley open, but if you are on the evolution bill and everyone has to muster at 4 and be on station at 430 for the evolution you obviously can't leave. So that is one meal. Then you miss lunch because the evolution lasted so long, and finally it is time to get relieved.

Hooray! Twenty minutes before the galley closes. So it gets time to be relieved right, but your relief is no where to be found. They show up fifteen minutes late. 
>Why?

You ask.. And they tell you some nonsense like they were getting a snack or filling up their water bottle. Things they had time to do before they were supposed to be on watch but chose to do when watch started for them so they missed part of their watch.

So now you're off watch, but the galley is closed. Oh, wait there is midnight rations! Oh wait tonight you have the 20-24 so you'll be on watch when it happens.

And that is how it happens."
No. It just bothers me more when it is small. I mean if there is a real dirt bag and they get screwed over they probably had it coming. Or if their is a person standing in the way of a large group and that person is just being difficult then it may be justified.

People who tell a joke that everyone laughs at, and then constantly remind people of that time they said that one thing everyone laughed at even though it stopped being funny a long time ago. 
"If I say a joke and people don't laugh/ignore me, I just point it out and say, ""Well I guess that wasn't as funny as I thought!"" It usually gets me at least a chuckle."

Interesting relative to the obvious ones like sex abuse. You'd think it would only be a minor bother but here we have a number of people whom it really upsets. Sex abuse on the other hand tends not to be a minor bother.
I try not to think about it, but it always haunts me.  Being a victim in any fashion will always make you feel weak and/or foolish.  It also includes feelings of fury and misery whenever the idea or portrayal of sexual abuse arises.

"I think it is harder for smokers to see the effect of second hand smoke. I have a friend who smoked and hated having to go outside to enjoy a cigarette. Now that she is pregnant and can't smoke, she realizes how awful second hand smoke is. She doesn't want to be around it and it bothers her. It never bothered her before.

Also, my great grandparents were both smokers. When they died, my parents got a couch and a few lamps. At first, the smell was awful. We had to air the stuff out because it was making us all sick. Then my mom cleaned the lamps. Turns out they were a completely different color than they originally thought. Years of smoke stained it. Imagine what that does to lungs.

Different people have different tolerances. But there are clear problems caused by second hand smoke. It really isn't good for anyone. If you are an adult and you chose to do it, that's fine because it is your choice. But you kids don't get a choice and that isn't really fair."

My record collection has more than enough bands like that. I like the bands, but would never claim they are fantastic musicians."
"It's kind of like with horror movies or spicy food. It technically hurts, but it's also good at the same time. Furthermore, while most of the early bands of each genre are very raw and unprocessed, they are also followed by bands who are more refined. For example, early black metal sounds like it was recorded with approximately 10$ worth of studio equipment. Then you have bands like Carach Angren or Dimmu Borgir who have a much more refined sound. For death metal you can hear a clear difference between [Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4ksoIR8X4c) and [Opeth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfslLWySZYg).

I agree. Most places have a policy that if the system is down people cannot charge more than $50. Walmart refused to use this accepted practice, so they should have to pay for this mistake.

Planned Parenthood will do the same thing, without showing you a bunch of photos of aborted fetuses and other anti-abortion propaganda.
You sound like you're pro-life, which is totally fine. It's nice to have differing view points. My problem is (gotta be honest, I just sort of skimmed the wikipedia article) that these centers are lying to women to scare them into not having an abortion. 
"Wholesale infanticide? What the fuck are you talking about? You act like EVERY person going into a place like Planned Parenthood is getting an abortion.

Your attitude is something that instantly makes me angry.  This is probably the most important issue of our time, and time is running out to do anything about it.

"Yeah, your point was well taken. It is really a condemnation of society not just the school system. Schools are not equipped to succeed with out the input of parents. Teaching children appropriate conduct and how to act in society is their primary responsibility not the school's. And when parents fail to do so schools are often forced to become low grade prisons like in Chicago and Detroit. And because differential treatment is a good way to get sued school districts have to apply these rules even in schools without major disciplinary problems.

The method of killing matters more than the numbers killed, apparently. Like 3000 people dying in a one-off suicide attack is worse than 30,000 people dying in car crashes per year.
I actually noted that I follow the zero aggression doctrine, I completely agree that violence should never be the first response, that should be obvious to anyone above the age of 3, but sadly it is not. It is an unfortunate fact that (and I hope so much that I am wrong) there will ALWAYS be people who see it as not only the first, but only option. As long as there are people out there that see violence as the primary course, and cannot be persuaded otherwise, violence will be an ugly part of our tool kit.

">These are the specific definitions used in science; layman terms that equivocate on this aren't used in science

Thus, we have ""causation as defined within the context of scientific experimentation"" and ""causation""

You're wrong. You can EASILY observe evolution in bacteria. That's how antibiotic-resistant bacteria emerged.
"It is 100% observable.  According to your logic, erosion doesn't exist either.  The entire field of geology is based on extrapolation based on current ongoing processes, but there aren't many people screaming how plate tectonics are against God.  Fluid dynamics are based far shakier ground than evolution, but no one is going out screaming about how Bernouli's Equation is a lie and fluids just flow because God wants it that way.

Edit: And what you stumbled upon is part of what makes a theory a theory and it can never become fact.  A theory is an explanation of the way things work.  Even if you could sit down and watch the universe from the big bang to now, and every single thing about evolution, it would still not be a fact, because the theory is an explanation of the why and what will come.  It could be a coincidence and another force that acts very much like evolution could be the cause.  A theory cannot be proven right, it can only be supported or proven wrong.  So far, even with 150 years of constant attempts, evolution has not been proven wrong, nor even changed that much.  The biggest change has come from a greater understanding of epigenetics, which relate to external factors having effects on the statistical probability of certain genes being passed on to offspring.  "
"Also, according to this logic, redwoods don't grow from seeds to maturity.  No one has personally seen a redwood planted, then grow to reach a couple hundred feet tall.  You can observe all the different stages of them growing, but since you can't look at a specific plant all the way from a small seed to a mature 200' adult, it doesn't happen.

Our lifetime is an arbitrary length of time and there are literally thousands of processes that are well understood that take longer than a lifetime to occur.  Saying that we don't know because we only see one part of it is ridiculous.

You have apparently chosen not to answer me about what makes a fish a fish, but if you simply tried to think of what exactly defines a fish, then the idiocy of the argument you posed should have become apparent.  The ONLY way you can draw any hard lines between different types of animals is using phylogenetics (grouping all known descendants of a common ancestor), which ARE evolution.  They are maps of evolution.  Without this tool you literally CANNOT define separate ""kinds"" without huge amounts of overlap.  Shit, even ""plant"" vs ""animal"" has some overlap without phylogenetics.

Organisms don't fit into our grouping criteria.  We create grouping criteria to fit organisms.  It's no divine intervention that our naming scheme happens to fit the organisms we find now. We named things we found and grouped like with like.  We have recently found out that we were very wrong in many cases."

Spot on. That is exactly what is happening. Imagine you are a christian who believes the creation part of the bible should be taken literally (6000 yo earth made in 6 days etc.) and you don't want to change this belief. Of course you would try to argue against things that doesn't agree with that then.

btw if you are truly interested in this then the creationists do have their own answers for your questions about the grand canyon, volcanoes etc. Most of the arguments would probably involve a big flooding of the earth as described in the story of Noah and the arc.

> We can LITERALLY watch that happening, but we didn't see it start

Again you are extrapolating something you see over a small time to a very long time. One of the hidden assumptions when doing this is the assumption that the conditions in ancient times were approximately the same as the conditions today. Creationists would attack this assumption because the believe the flood actually happened."
Can very-accepted theories (such as gravity) be used to prove other theories (such as the Earth orbiting the sun)?
There is one problem there: evolution also claims that, over time, a change of kinds occurred. I doubt science has found conclusive evidence for that. Like I mentioned earlier, I don't mean finch to finch, I mean fish to reptile change
Evolution only provides a theory for modification of life on earth; it fails to explain the earth. We know the universe isnt infinitely old by reason of thermodynamics. At some point something came of nothing. This means the mass-energy was created, which defies science. If some other universe/being had to input energy into our system to start it, it seems illogical assume it couldnt possibly have had an impact on anything else. pair production can plausibly provide a possible --unrealistic-- explanation for mass, but it still fails as a solution due to it requiring vacuum energy.

Here's the first result I clicked:

>Results  Effect size estimates were combined using meta-analytic procedures. As expected, the short-term effects of violent media were greater for adults than for children whereas the long-term effects were greater for children than for adults. The results also showed that there were overall modest but significant effect sizes for exposure to media violence on aggressive behaviors, aggressive thoughts, angry feelings, arousal levels, and helping behavior.

Another:

>Research on exposure to television and movie violence suggests that playing violent video games will increase aggressive behavior. A meta-analytic review of the video-game research literature reveals that violent video games increase aggressive behavior in children and young adults. Experimental and nonexperimental studies with males and females in laboratory and field settings support this conclusion. Analyses also reveal that exposure to violent video games increases physiological arousal and aggression-related thoughts and feelings. Playing violent video games also decreases prosocial behavior."
Google scholar is your friend. I don't have links right now, but on a old reddit account I went to /r/psychology and asked some folks about this, the response was pretty overwhelming.

"Here is an interesting quote in a study on the second page of results:

>Fifty years of news coverage on the link between media violence and aggression have left the U.S. public confused. Typical news articles pit researchers and child advocates against entertainment industry representatives, frequently giving equal weight to the arguments of both sides. A comparison of news reports and scientific knowledge about media effects reveals a disturbing discontinuity: Over the past 50 years, the average news report has changed from claims of a weak link to a moderate link and then back to a weak link between media violence and aggression. However, since 1975, the scientific confidence and statistical magnitude of this link has been clearly positive and has consistently increased over time. Reasons for this discontinuity between news reports and the actual state of scientific knowledge include the vested interests of the news reporting, and the failure of the research community to effectively argue the scientific case.

"You are correct XxandrealphusxX and thank you, I don't like racism at all I think it's bullshit to hate someone for reasons beyond their control, I know it's a much smaller scale compared to racism but I was bullied for almost 16 straight years for having red hair and freckles so I understand, I also have many aboriginal friends who have endured racism before. I come from a rural Australian town where around 60-50% of the population consists of black families.

Now here's a twist to the people above, even though I despise racism I myself admit to being partly racist, living for 19 years in a small town and witnessing at least once a month having a break-in/assault/stolen car/vandalised house or car/arson/many more crimes happen to good, honest people and they get away with it or basically get a slap on the wrist because of the most bullshit and bias/racist reasons. Most of the time anything criminal was done by a local aboriginal culprit that was identified by countless witnesses but get away with it for legal reasons. Although just a few days ago I made a upsetting discovery, I was at the beach (I have moved away now to the coast) with my girlfriend and I had my stuff stashed somewhere further away that I kept in eyesight, and I saw an aboriginal family hanging around that area and I felt that I needed to check my stuff to see if anything was stolen, nothing was, they walked right past an iPhone and other valuable-ish stuff and didn't even touch it, that's when I realised that living in *unnamed town* had slowly and partly made me a racist, or realistically it made me bias to aboriginals from home.

To conclude because I'm starting to rant, I'm well aware that when It comes to the criminal world races don't matter, all countries have theives and rapists, all cultures do, all races do, but where I lived for most of my life DOES have more black criminals than it does Asian or white.

Np, some people might say I'm racist, I guess it's not up to me to say, but I doubt I'm a racist, and I thought I would just share a story with someone I could relate to, not here to clarify with the world my morals. But thx for asking anyway.
"Exactly. It's awful. And in a world were most people are constantly referring to it, it can be difficult.

Being a lawyer would not protect them from that. Although I am not a fan of religion in general I will entertain discussions about it and don't really dislike people that were brought up on church, but these bastards are in another league of fucked up.  There is no logical explanation for why they do what they do or why they protest the things that they do. They are closed minded cowardly little fucks that need to be taught a lesson.  They are as bad as the KKK(without the violence) and there is no room for them in the human race.

The difference is that I've actually listened to the music that I'm criticizing. They instantly assume that I worship satan for listening to music that they've never listened to in their lives.
">bigoted 

You dont even know what this word means do you. And they can't ""force"" you to do anything, it's all voluntary. The state does not mandate that you go to a CPC. If you are uneasy about abortion, they give you the other side of the story. Abortion does occasionally ruin lives, and it does cause a lot of issues for both genders. And there's the whole ""we very well could be killing infants but we're overlooking that because it'd be such a terrible realization that we'd rather not think about it"" 

And I never even mentioned Planned Parenthood. I dont think any one gives a shit about everything that Planned Parenthood does aside form abortion. I dont care that they give out birth control, or treat men, or do STD testing, that's all fine. No one thinks those are bad things. People are still not sure about abortion though, which is the one things that Planned Parenthood does that makes people uneasy. You can do all this great extra shit, but it's irrelevant if you still are doing something that we very well could realize is *extremely* fucked up 20 years from now. 

Again, back to the ""brainwashing"".  And what are CPCs brainwashing people to do exactly? Not kill their infants? Oh, the horror. There's nothing ""unlawful"" going on, and you could easily argue that Planned Parenthood ""brainwashes"" people.You need to learn what bigoted means, what brainwashing means, what is lawful and unlawful, and how flimsy our definition of ""life"" is, and how frequently it changes over the decades, and how it might be a good idea to err on the side of you know, not potentially carrying out a genocide if we find out we are wrong.

What happens when we realize they are people? What happens when you suddenly realize that we were carrying out infanticide on a mass scale? Do people not think it might be better to err on the side of caution? Why are you so certain of this ""science"", when the scientific community is regularly proving itself wrong and updating its stance? I mean, the stakes for being wrong are...incomprehensible. Worse than hitler/stalin genocide, all at the hands of soccer moms and regular people. It's terrifying to think about. I dont know if Im pro-life, Im definitely sympathetic, but I dont think I could ever be pro-abortion because of the implications. Can you imagine what would happen if we somehow definitively proved abortions are killing people? It blows my mind that people don't think about this. "

"The issue is that ""men's rights"" groups just woefully miss the forest for the trees.

Yeah, because of shitty gender roles that say women are caregivers and men are bread winners.  You know, the same shitty gender roles that result in women making 15% less in the workforce.  The ones that feminism is all about ending.

""Men's rights"" groups are just misguided, but the end result is damn infuriating.  Their solutions are consistently short sighted and they never both to address the elephant in the room.

Meanwhile, their main complaint of feminism is that those crazy bitches are trying to oppress men!  Dude, you can't oppress a man (on the basis of his gender).  You can try, but you won't accomplish anything.  It takes a society to create oppression, not one person being kinda bitchy to you."
"It isn't black and white, but one of those you know it when you see it kinds of situations. I heard some women who think all men are misogynistic assholes out to enslave women kind by forcing them into marriage and motherhood (I wish I was kidding). I think people who flip out at someone for holding the door open for them because it is sexist is stupid (who doesn't hold the door for other people). Women should be given equal opportunities, but that does not mean they should get jobs they don't qualify for. For example, if you are a firefighter you should have the same qualifications. If you can't lift the required amount of weight, etc., it's dangerous for you and everyone around you. 

Like most extremist groups, it's about taking something to such an extreme that they hate anyone who doesn't believe the exact same thing and then accuses them of being sexist or hateful. "

I'm not sure where to lay blame for parenting getting worse and worse.  I remember as a kid, I got my rear end whipped if I fucked up bad!  I remember having friends who got grounded, or had time out or whatever.  Now those people and myself are parents, and it's interesting to be in public with them.  My kids know better than to cause trouble in a store, lest they get their hind parts popped!  Those same people who got time out as kids, use the same tactics on their kids, and there is a big difference in the behavior of the kids.

I'm not saying that my way is the best way by any means, but I do believe in firm discipline when needed, and I like to think the actions of my children reflect that."
Perhaps I worded that wrong. I was saying that smaller guys would try to provoke or pick fights with me to look tough to their friends. Fortunately I've never had friends that tried to get me to (literally) fight their battles.
"Systems are for processing things, not people. If you want a system that will harvest cauliflower and sort it into nice little boxes... you've got lots of options. And if those systems don't work, you can fix them.

But the problem with a system that processes people isn't one that can be fixed. Because when a system is fixed, it still just processes things. And once it's fixed, those people in it become nothing more than things.

On a more practical level, how could you ever expect to fix that? Fire that guy, hire a more reasonable one? Sorry, he's not the only bad actor. The public school system is full of them. And even if you fire all of them (good luck doing that short of busting teachers' unions), you'd discover that you have a hard time replacing them. There aren't enough good guys to fill in the gaps.

Worse, those good guys would soon end up the same way. You see, the bad ones aren't bad because they have evil souls, but because this is what they got twisted into when you put them in this ""system"". Some maybe twisted earlier than others, some might hold out for years, but the people aren't the real problem. Can you fix the rules and regulations and the stress that twisted them? Not really. These rules were developed because of problems that popped up over the years, and they were the best compromises that legislators and administrators could come up with considering the constraints and limitations they labored under.

So yes, I think I will ""fuck fixing the broken parts of the system"". My children are too important to me to toss onto the fires of Moloch, hoping that somehow if I do so maybe the system will be fixed quickly enough that they aren't ground up into shit and excreted out the other end.

I am not disagreeing with that, so much to say that you are not resorting to violence when you defend yourself, but that your self defense is just a part of the violence they have created.
"I am saying that his examples were flawed in that they all rely on self defense. For self defense to exist there already has to be a situation of violence before that, and that situation of violence is the one someone has resorted to, which the self defense is just part of.

That would mean defending against an invading country, or against a pipe wielding maniac isn't resorting to violence, but is just a part of the violence the other party has resorted to, and to weigh the worth of it you have to weigh the outcome to the pipe wielder or to the invading country."

If someone is in the left lane and they won't get over, flash your lights or something. If they really don't move, then go around them, cut them off, whatever. Jerks, but rare.

What usually happens is traffic is dense, and it's not that the people in the left lane are going slow, it's that everyone is going around a truck and a line stacks up. Then there are people that race up behind the truck, cut in to the left lane by forcing their way in, jump around the truck, and do the same thing to the next one.

These people deserve worse than death. I will *not* let these people in, and I hate when people in front of me let them in because it causes everyone to brake in the left lane, slowing it down even further, and these people are *always* a hazard. I would rather they cause a pileup behind me than one in front of me, so I will do anything it takes to keep them behind me.

I didn't think this need elaboration but apparently certain people can't see more then their own view point. People go to movie theatre for the social experience as much as they do to see a movie. That's why you see everything from big groups of friends to dates taking place at the theatres, as opposed one person alone. 

Also for some reason you have it pictured that I sit at the movies theatres and text for the whole time.

The ""Theory of Evolution"" is actually the ""Theory of All Life on Earth having a Common Ancestor and the Variation We See is the Result of Speciation Through Evolution"".  It just doesn't have the same ring to it.  Evolution occurs.  This is fact.  We can see it.  We can measure it.  We can predict it.  Speciation occurs.  This is fact.  The Theory is the explanation of the effects of these things over time.  The FACT that evolution occurs does not make any predictions at all.

Then just *try* to come back and claim there's no evidence for evolution.

Edit: Keep in mind, that's only the fossil record. There's [comparative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_for_evolution#Evidence_from_comparative_anatomy), [genetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_for_evolution#Genetics), [biogeographical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_for_evolution#Evidence_from_geographical_distribution), and [observed speciation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_for_evolution#Evidence_from_observed_speciation) events too."
"Nothing that occurs ""defies science"" that's a misunderstanding of science.  Things can not fit current theories, but theories are not static, and also often something can appear to not fit, but actually be just more complex than it first seems.

Additionally, what you just described is NOT intelligent design.  Evolution doesn't even address abiogenesis.  Intelligent design is a term used for the idea of ""guided evolution"".  This is the ""invisible gardener"".  There's zero evidence for it."
Namely that adaptations and mutations in species are non-random. A change of kinds does occur, as we have intermediate states between branches of the evolutionary tree.Mole lizards are a great example of this, as are amphibians (which are the (loose) intermediate between fish and lizards.

This man, as well as his Co-author, have no scientific background. As such, they cannot be taken seriously. Mr. Cremo has built his career by giving fodder to conspiracy theorists. Looking into the organizations with which he is a part, you'll notice none of them are associated with scientific expertise.

This man is not reliable. He has no idea what he's taking about. There has never been a man found in any strata of Jurassic age. 

I'm a geologist. As a scientist myself, let me emphasize that there are no conspiracies with doctored images of fossils or the fossils themselves. Above all, **THERE ARE NO AUTHORITIES IN SCIENCE.** There is nobody messing with the geology or fossils of any region on Earth. *Homo sapiens* have only been present on Earth for up to 250,000 years (and that's the highest estimate).

There's a difference between understanding that the letter J sounds like an H in Spanish and going way out of your way to put a non-native accent on a word commonly used among English speakers when everyone would know what you were talking about if you just pronounced it with an English accent. It's pretentious as hell.

Facetiousness aside, you pronounce it as halla-pen-yo in english because that's the way everyone else pronounces it in english. Nobody pronounces croissant qwasson, so it's different."
"It's also an English word though and the english pronunciation is different from the french.

Yes, but the gender roles benefit the women, not the man. You can say all you want about gender roles and how women are considered weak but at the end of the day, it is men who have to pay money for 18 years.
So if a woman believes that other women should get jobs that (you believe) they don't qualify for in the name of equal opportunity, it's reasonable to compare her to a Nazi?  To say that she is like a group who committed the most reviled act of genocide in the 20th century?
When you're comparing a group of people to Nazis you'd better be damn sure that you're making a reasonable comparison.  Fighting for women's rights will never be equivalent to systematically exterminating millions of people.

"Even if a school had the funding, what benefit is there to installing cameras everywhere?  I can see having main hallways, but there is also locker rooms, bathrooms, classrooms, stairwells, outside, tons of places that make it just too much money to justify having cameras everywhere.  Your scenario is exactly why I said there is no perfect system. 

In your scenario the girl definitely got screwed over.  In a system where the person who starts the fight gets punished the rage inducing story is now about how a guy was let off free from a fight he started because his friends were the only witnesses to the fight.  Or even worse, a kid with perfect grades beat up a kid who occasionally got in trouble because he knew the school wouldn't believe that he started the fight.  What I'm saying is no matter what you do as a school you are opening yourself up to looking like jackasses if a certain scenario comes up.  Criticizing their policy (which I think is the one that limits the damage the most) just means that you think that everything is black and white and there's some perfect punishment system out there that will ensure the right people are always in trouble."

I'd find it funny to take the phone and hand it to an usher if you had it out more than once.

Sure! I was 26 and she was 22 but had never lived outside of her mom's. She *really* needed to be outta there. I have a 4 bedroom to myself and we'd been together seriously about 6 months so I asked her to move in. It was great for a couple years then she said she didn't want to go from her mother's house to her husband's. I tried to be understanding and helped her move into a place just a couple blocks away from me. She just got more distant slowly over the next couple years then finally cut it off the day after New Years (which we spent together and I had no clue what was coming). We were apart for a month and a half and she tried to come back but I resisted. She relented for over 6 months and I finally gave in in July. We dated a couple months and she dumped me again on my birthday last month. Suffice to say, I've learned my lesson with that one.

">bigoted

You do not understand the literal definition of this word, and it has become meaningless. And yes, Planned Parenthood does do abortions, not in every Planned Parenthood center and not in every state. 3% of their activity is related directly to administering abortion. The tactic is to crowd out abortions with a bunch of other activities to make people less mad, but people don't give a shit about all of the other things. It doesn't change the fact that they still deal with abortions. They could carry out 1,000s of more services and reduce their abortion related activities to half a percent, and it still would not change anything, the moral imperative is still there. Absolutely no one argues that they shouldn't hand out birth control, or test for STDs, or whatever. If that's all they did, they wouldn't be controversial, because most colleges do that shit for free anyways and no one cares. There is still a very real possibility that the scientific community will change its opinion on what constitutes life, and a whole generation of moms, dads, uncles, blue and white collar workers, college kids, everyone, could have been complicit in carrying out mass infanticide.

It seems you're right about that. So for Australia, that might work to some degree. Though there is no such thing where I'm from and postage and shipping is usually always quite a good chump of change, sadly:/"

It's good that you recognize that. I feel too often people idolize their parents a bit too much. I'm not saying their bad people or anything close to it, just that they're human too. Knowing what you want from life and from a relationship can help you have much healthier relationships in the future. This may be hard, but at least now you know more about what you don't want in a relationship so you can hopefully, in turn, avoid it in the future.

"The LHC detected quark–gluon plasma and the Higgs Boson thanks to data from over 300 trillion ( 3 x 10^14 ) LHC proton-proton collisions being analyzed. This is what gave them the ability to declare truth (no ""truth"" quotes needed) to [5-sigma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of the findings.

I'm not seeing that level of confidence in religious zealotry, or amount of evidence. Everyone's got an opinion, yours is above, the data of what science does to prove facts doesn't gel with your opinion. You don't need to be a zealot to declare 2 plus 2 equals 4, even if you haven't repeated the experiment with an infinite number of Lego bricks. But if you put two Lego bricks with another two Lego bricks a few million times and end up with four bricks, you know what's what.

This is not science's fault, or problem. Philosophy may deal with hypotheticals like teapots in orbit between here and Mars. Science only declares things as facts when they're observed, the experiments are repeated, and the outcome under the same circumstances is always so. (EDIT - or, at least, has always turned out to be so. But that's true of any other fact.)"
That is one of the many sources I have, yes. Tell me, if you support evolution, do you have a firm response to the points expressed in that video?
"While it doesn't state specifically that there are only 4 people at the time, the book of genesis lists hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals, most of whom are never mentioned again.  You don't think the 5th person in existence would be worth mentioning?  Or even something to say that there were other children?  None were mentioned before the story of Cain and Abel.  And also there is no prior mention of the Land of Canaan, yet it is referenced elsewhere.  It's a HUGE hole in the story, and it is never addressed.

And I have truly looked into what religious people believe, and not just Christianity, but Eastern religions as well.  And as of yet, i have never seen a single piece of evidence for a huge change in natural processes.  Physics aren't changing, and there's no reason to believe that they ever have."
"Don't feel bad about it, really. A lot of public education systems have scientific information edited out by religious councils, and  many people can't afford higher education to fix the damage improper education causes.

Ignorance isn't a terrible thing, in and of itself. It can be fixed, unless a person chooses to remain ignorant.

You're willing to learn! ^Lots ^of ^people ^aren't, ^unfortunately. Feel good about that! :)"
"Thank you, hahah. Evolution is a favorite study of mine.

I at least make an effort to try to educate scientifically ignorant people, because sometimes it works. Success is very rare, but every one of them counts."
"I think one of the biggest misunderstandings is the assumption that ""kinds"" are immutable, and evolution occurs outside of the ""kinds"" of species, which of course isn't true.

But lungfish are awesome! They're more related to [coelacanths and Tiktaalik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcopterygii) than to other bony fishes. I was almost tripped up at first, because Wiki didn't have Actinopterygii (bony fish) as a major class, but split it up into ray-finned (most fish) and lobe-finned (coelacanths) classes, so I had to search a bit for that link.

As for lungless salamanders, well, they have [gills](http://creepyanimals.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/olm-head2.jpg), even with their amphibian respiratory skins. Some of them even have [internal gills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphiuma)."
"No, that's not what intelligent design is. And it is exactly as plausible as the idea that the universe was sneezed into existence by a quantum megapig.

What you're talking about is the unifying theory. We don't have one yet. And not having it doesn't mean that the theories we have don't explain the phenomenons they're about."
"What I said stands. There are no authorities in science. You're obviously not acquainted well with the scientific community, because if you had been you would've known that most scientists get paid by grants and donations; monies which have no connection to any higher, central authority in science. There are scientific organizations who by and large advocate for spreading knowledge in their  particular field of study. However, there is no authority in science like there is an authority in religion for example,  like imams or the pope.

Michael Cremo, as I said, has no scientific expertise. As such, he can neither comprehend the data nor make an accurate interpretation of the data submitted by any archeologist. So if he can't make an accurate interpretation of the data, how can you believe a word Cremo says? He's delusional if he thinks he can reject mountains of evidence in exchange for his abhorrent, capricious misunderstandings. 

While I don't doubt your sincerity (as I do think you're being quite sincere), I think you're deluding yourself by not looking at the geologic and archeological evidence yourself but taking this man's word for it instead. I challenge you to find any reputable archeological or geological reference (from a journal or scientific foundation) that mentions any of the egregious misgivings asserted by Cremo's book.

Why not read the scientific papers yourself? I said there are no authorities in science. Scientists, by virtue if the scientific method, have to be transparent in their work. Scientists who have ever doctored or manipulated data to fit their conclusions have all been debunked by now. Why? **Because the scientific method is based in repeatable experimentation. That's why we don't have science that doesn't work. If the science doesn't work, it gets thrown out because it's wrong, not because of some self-generated delusion that science is ruled by big bad boogymen who corrupt and fix data by their own devices.**

Mr. Cremo's writing is opprobrious, and his ideas are a disgrace to the human intellect. He makes up evidence on the fly, which is sinister in its very being. It's people like him who misuse the power they achieve in the public domain that are bad for society. A scientifically ignorant person such as yourself wouldn't know between what's right and what's wrong scientifically. It's a shame that your head was inundated with Mr. Cremo's dogma.

And that reminds me: as a scientist, let me mention that it's okay to be scientifically ignorant. However, as soon as scientific ignorance is portrayed as scientific truth (in this case by Mr. Cremo),  that's when I have a problem with it.

"That will almost certainly change based on dialect.  All of the Juans i've met were Hwan, not One.  That being said, ""yo"" in Puerto Rican Spanish is pronounced closer to ""jaux"", so there are certainly some severe differences."
"> You don't just get to take a foreign word and call it ""English"" and pronounce it however you want.

Except that's exactly what happens when languages borrow words. When Italians say ""computer"" (which is the Italian word for computer) do you think they pronounce it the way we do in English or with an Italian accent? Of course they pronounce it with an italian accent because they're speaking italian. similarly, we say croissant like cruh-sant because we don't have the phonemes in english to pronounce it with the true french pronunciation  [kʁwa.sɑ̃] (see [this page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant) for confirmation that neither english pronunciation matches the french one).

You easily could take the word falafel and pronounce it like fuckyou but the difference is that no one would have any fucking idea what you're saying. however, when I pronounce croissant [krəˈsɑːnt ] (cruh-sant), you know what I mean because that's a word in english. on the other hand there's no word in english that's spelled falafel and but is pronounced fuckyou."

"And I'd deserve it. I'm just saying that it's not so cut-and-dry, and it kinda makes someone look like an asshole to say that in ALL cases you should do *blank*, because we're not all the same person, and we're not all bothered by the same things.

The whole point I was trying to make was essentially ""be careful what you wish for"".  TPM (time, place, manner) restrictions are popular for things like the Westboro Baptist Church.

"A7X, Mudvayne, and Stone Sour are NOT metal, which I assume is why you are being down voted. They are hard rock/nu-metal (which is closer to rock than metal)/groove rock with metal influences. I'm not saying that they are bad or don't have talent, but they are not metal. I would also list Slipknot as not being metal, ESPECIALLY their older material. And yes, I am aware that some of these bands' individual songs are metal, but as a whole they are not.

To expand your horizons on what is and is not metal, use www.metal-archives.com They are the world's biggest metal encyclopedia.

EDIT: You may also be getting downvoted because you inferred that death metal is talentless screaming, while claiming to like bands that aren't even metal.

EDIT2: You probably won't like Amon Amarth."
Yes, big Stone Sour fan. I also like bands like Five Finger Death Punch, dude has a pretty solid voice and when he screams he sounds very similar to a healthy Corey Taylor. If the band has bad ass guitar riffs, a hell of a good drummer and a powerful singer, you've got a day 1 purchase from me.
Less than half of a percent. There are a few clinics in NY and I think California that do abortions, according to the internet, but the vast majority just don't.
">""**Bigot**: a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc. : a bigoted person; especially : a person who hates or refuses to accept the members of a particular group (such as a racial or religious group)""

That is you. You hate PP, you hate the concept of anyone getting an abortion, and you're judging an entire company as evil because of one service they offer, that is done less than half of a percent of all of their services. 

You don't mention the talks they give to the patients, the mandatory evaluations the patients are given regarding their mental state, and you don't mention that the majority of the people that consider abortions don't go through with it. No, because some get it, it's evil. The same people that get it would go through and do it no matter if it were PP or not, at least they're choosing to do it through a safe center that sends them to a doctor that CAN.

Please, you are a bigot. Just because you don't like that I'm calling you one doesn't mean you aren't. You fit the fucking definition exactly. You're overly angry about something that doesn't affect you, and are preaching like you're a Priest about how it's wrong and we should all feel guilty about it."
If you choose to ignore the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, you do make me angry.  A significant portion of the population makes me angry.  Politicians whose actions depend on the opinions of a willfully uninformed populace make me angry.  These things are all related.
Sorry, I think I misinterpreted what you were saying. It seemed like you were saying that women had it worse when you said that women made 15% less (which I don't believe is true but that's another can of worms I don't want to open). I completely agree that gender roles affect both men and women and we should work towards getting rid of them. Thanks for claifying.
Hum, the context was 'willful ignorance', which to me is the quintessential quality of a young-earth creationist. I'm sorry you think my comment was dumb.... But as pointed out, I'm not particularly concerned with what you (or the Reddit community at large) thinks about my input.
"What you just described sounds a lot like profiling.  As the principal/administrator you can never know who started the fight definitively and the only reasonable way to combat that is to punish both parties.  It sucks but it's much better than explicitly stating that you believe one student (or after many cases one group of students) more than the other.  It's just asking for the parents to claim that their child wasn't treated fairly because of their troubled past and also that the school doesn't want to punish good students when they do do something wrong.  Even worse they argue that the school doesn't care about students who are struggling in school and are perpetuating their problems by punishing them more.

Also bullying is a very difficult thing to identify based on one situation .  A kid who starts the fight might be the one who was being bullied all along and now he is the only one in trouble because he threw the first punch after a long period of emotional abuse.  Don't you think the real bullies would take advantage of that and then claim they were the victim the whole time because they didn't technically start the fight?  It's just too risky to punish one person and hope that you get it right."
"Far more than 10% get through the public school system without being traumatized any more than anyone else. The trauma is a result of the ages of the people in school, not the schools. Every school is also good and bad at times, whether it be public or private. 

With a government bureaucrat, there is disclosure and accountability in a single area. With corporate bureaucrat's it is fragmented and the disclosures and openness are far less. Which ignores the fact that if it was all privatized, it would end up the same as it is now, but now with less accountability and a fractured system where it is harder to hold people accountable. 

The private comes from the fact that you want no public schools. If it is not public, it can only be private. It's basic logical principals, that's where it came from. 

Yes, clearly I need to be prescribed anti-psychotics because I must be delusional to disagree with someone with a high pedigree such as yourself who clearly has all the solutions to life's problems even though you provide no evidence for the fact or have provided any reasonable alternative to my points other than name calling. "
"While I do agree with what you are saying, for the most part a child's parents are able to make any and every decision for their child, regardless of what the kid needs or wants. The law can and does get involved in extreme cases, but besides that a child's rights are determined by-and-large by what the parents believe is right for them.
At least that's my understanding of it. I'm no expert, and you have a valid point, it is rather narrow-minded to limit their rights to just those two points. And yes, I agree that parents/guardians do not get to treat their kids like slaves, that is not what I meant to imply at all."
Of course. I'm sure if I look hard enough I can find pumpkin pie to go with a pumpkin spiced late...but it's not quite the same without the Christmas music in the background and the fresh smell of freedom. Also, I'm sure such an expatriate community exists...but they're all just a bunch of phonies.
"To me it just sounds like personal preference.

I could argue in the same vein that people who don't pursue a hobby somewhat competitively have no competitive spirit and hence will get nowhere in life due to their lack of drive and motivation. But I don't, because that's stupid. Being competitive in your hobbies is no more of a personality requirement than ""needing"" to read books.

Can I remind you that I don't read nothing at all. I read some non-fiction, particularly science related because that's what interests me. Some have also commented that even reading comments on reddit is a form of entertainment-based reading. I just don't enjoy most fiction books, never have done.

To be honest you sound a lot like the people I was complaining about in my original comment."
"Also you seem to be saying that I have trouble concentrating with that comment. I can tell you that there are other things people do that require concentration besides books. Being dedicated to anything requires it. Studying, keeping a job, looking after yourself.

"Lungless salamanders are a specific group of salamander and the first example you gave may be a juvenile or perhaps a paedomorphic adult, or it may not be a member of that family at all.

They are members of the family plethodontidae.  They have no lungs at all, and as adults, have no gills, but respire entirely through their skin and a little bit of skin in their mouth.

The basic issue behind this argument is the assumption that we grouped animals accurately by ""kind"", as you say.  But the simple fact is, the groups we made don't even exist.

I don't hate abortion, or hate Planned Parenthood. I think that when the state has to decide at which point it needs to protect a life, that it's probably smart to err on the side of caution*, seeing as our medical and scientific definitions change every decade.* This is the real issue. When does the state have an interest in protecting a life. If I end up being wrong, people have extra kids they didn't account for. If you're wrong, *then we have been carrying out one of the longest ongoing genocides this century*. Again, I agree the jury is out on the matter, and for me, this is enough to justify erring on the side of caution. This shouldn't be this hard to defend when the mother's life is not at stake.
