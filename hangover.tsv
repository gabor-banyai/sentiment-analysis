textSince I hit 42 years old, I get crippling hangovers. 2 or 3 large glasses of water before I go to sleep makes an incredible difference though, followed by 6-8 hours of sleep. If I forget to drink the water, just fucking shoot me please.
Think of all the ways you can make something come out of your body. Do all of those. Toilet, blow your nose, have an orgasm, turn on a hot shower if only to make yourself sweat a bit. Basically clear out all the pipes you can, then drink a lot of water and take a nap. Nothing works better for me.
"Drink a shit ton of water before sleeping. Then do that again right when you wake up. Take a hot shower. When you’re ready for food, go get pho or eat something fast food related. I’ve been into wingstop atm for hangovers.

Edit: Or drink when you get up to ensure no headache, then start drinking the water like crazy."
Turn the shower on. Chug 2 bottles of water, throw up. Get in the shower. Then go get greasy food and delete all my drunk texts.
About a gallon of water just before bed. Wake up, have my beer shit, a bunch more water, and a fat greasy breakfast.
This is more for prevention, but when I get home from drinking I always have something to eat and then I stay up for like 2 hours in bed lol. It’s hard not to just crash, but I swear it works for me.
"Youth.

Early twenties and a fry up or hair of the dog would have you sorted for the day.

Roll forward a couple of decades and you need days to recover.


Edit a word"
I don't drink anymore, but when I used to, my hangover cure was ready salted potato chips, pickles and Coca-Cola. The combination of the sugary drink, the salty, fatty snack and the electrolytes in pickles was just perfect. Gatorade also works.
Before bed drink an electrolyte and another glass of water. Come morning even if you don't feel like it have a greasy meal drink another electrolyte, take some painkillers with water then back to sleep.
"I've got this down to a science.

Before sleeping:

- Stay up later to sober up a bit and have some food if possible

- At least a glass of water for every drink I've had

- Vitamin B12

- Magnesium & CBD Oil - helps with anxiety and lets me get the full amount of sleep

- Another glass of water at the bedside for when I wake up insanely thirsty

After waking up:

- Hot shower 

- Take a shit

- A soup noodle - Pho is ideal, but a Cup Noodle will do. Drink all the broth.

- More water. Hydration is key"
"Before going to bed: a bottle of Gatorade, a banana, and two aspirin. 

Morning of: Sausage McMuffin with Egg, hash brown, and orange juice."
A swim in cold(or atleast semi cold) water. It jolts your body awake and makes you forget about feeling like shit during and helps out even after you get out.
Cook a flank steak pan seared in salt and butter, eat that, put on a pair of wet socks and go back to sleep...works everytime
Drink water. Eat poached egg on toast with a generous sprinkle of salt. Have a glass of pineapple juice and a strong coffee. Drink more water and wash two painkillers down with a bottle of beer. Drink more water.
best way to cure a hangover is prevention imo, make sure you're hydrated/have eaten enough before you start drinking in the first place & don't drink anything too sugar-y (soda), then when you get home drink a ton of water, get some sleep, more water when you wake up. 9/10 times that makes it bearable
Chug a literal metric fuckton of water before you go to sleep the night before. Just drink as much water as you literally can, then fall asleep before you have the chance to piss it out. Never had a hangover when doing this.
Drink a Gatorade and eat a hot or cold sandwich before bed I've come to find beard helps. When you wake up drink another Gatorade or two eat something greasy preferably a breakfast sandwich and I usually do this but you obviously don't have to but I also light up a joint and then take nap.
"Okay so I am pretty qualified to answer this one. 

The best cure is sleep. If you can go back to sleep and get at least an extra hour, you'll wake up groggy rather than hungover. If the hangover is especially bad, then it's nearly impossible to sleep. This is why it's good to have some sort of sleeping aid available for emergencies (valium/xanax or failing that an OTC or CBD oil) to force yourself to get that life-saving hour. I used to swear by co-codamol but it turns out the paracetamol is extremely bad for your liver so do not make that mistake. 

If you can't get that extra hour of sleep, then the best cure is beer and eggs. As much of both as possible. Scrambled egg on toast is a good one. Put ketchup on the eggs too if you can. 

Huevos Rancheros is the best though.

If you don't want to drink more beer then you eat the eggs and drink full fat coke.

When it comes to the best beer to drink, I recommend you go for a cask ale - a session ipa or golden beer - because these are warm and not fizzy, so you can neck the first pint and then sip the second.

Bloody Mary's are also good if you can't face beer.

Basically any hangover can be cured by a combination of sleep, protein, sugar and alcohol. All the people saying you can cure a hangover with just water are amateurs. Yeah rehydration is necessary but it is no way sufficent"
"2 advil, a large sprite (this is the actual magic so don't skip it!) and something spicy/fatty/salty/crunchy

Personally my favorite food choice is Chick fil a hashbrowns with their spicy sweet Sriracha sauce, I just sit in their parking lot slowly eating and drinking my sprite whilst I regret my decisions....

*Sprite (no exceptions or substitutions) helps break down the remaining alcohol in your system and accelerates the hangover process so its over sooner. For good measure drink some sprite before you go to bed!"
Quitting. I used to be a really heavy drinker. Started at 16 and never had a hangover until 27. 6 to 8 large beers every night and binge drinking at the weekend. Had to stop at 38 because I'd start to go through alcohol withdrawal during the middle of the night, suffer all day until work finished and then drink 6 to 8 beers again which made me feel better. There is no way to cure a hangover. You just have to wait until your body clears out the poison.
"You need to lay the foundations of the cure before you go home.

This requires the consumption of a greasy kebab / burger. The kebab is the preferred option. This is best from a fast food van/street vendor or, at a push, a kebab shop but this shop must be frequented by other inidividuals in a similar state (i.e. pissed as a fart) as you.

You need to eat this food of Gods outside and away from where you bought it. This is important as you will a) get fresh air & b) not have to be near drunk people. Ugghhh.

When you get home and before you pour yourself into bed, have a drink of water. In morning/when you wake up have another glass of water and then get someone to make you a full English breakfast - sausages, baked beans, mushrooms, eggs & a slice or two of fried bread."
My favorite is IBC root beer(any decent root beer) and followed by chocolate milk- it's weird but it works to calm tummy and head. Also, drink at least a glass of water before bed, but I am guessing this is a morning after post.
"Aside from the obligatory drink water before bed, this used to be my routine when I woke up with a hangover:    
- Get out of bed relatively early, basically as soon as you wake up from having to pee or whatever, don't sleep in too late    
- Take a nice hot shower, get rid of that alcohol funk.    
- Hearty breakfast. Orange juice, eggs/bacon, pancakes, poutine or whatever greasy/salty food you can stomach.    
- *Now* you go back to bed. Now you've freshened up and have had a good meal, you'll sleep so much better. Next time you wake up, you'll feel a million times better than if you had just slept in all this time."
Set your alarm for one hour before you have to get up. Put a sugar free Gatorade and a glass of water and an advil next your your bed. When the alarm goes off, drink both drinks and take the advil and sleep for another hour. Then for breakfast eat a massive amount of protein, like 3 eggs and some meat. You'll feel 87% better
Pedialyte, I remember a college campus that had a cvs vending machine or something and it sold mini pedialyte bottles but strangely they were always out of stock
Prevention is the way to go. Eat a snack, drink some water or coconut water, take some ibuprofen before you go to bed. Then have something spicy/salty when you wake up, like V8 with hot sauce or soup.
I drink a bottle of Farris, carbonated water with added minerals, 1 valium and some spicy and savoury soup/broth
Ondansetron. It’s an anti nausea drug given for chemotherapy and other things. You literally can’t feel sick on it. Add a couple headache tablets, an antacid and some water and it’s it’s like that big night out never happened.
Topo Chico or Regular Coca Cola (Mexican Coke if you can find it) over lots of ice with fresh lime juice. That, ibuprofen and starchy food always does the trick for me. Works nicely for any tummy aches too.
Heres what you do....a cold water face clean, brush yo god damn teeth, a banana follwed by semi cold water and a Joint..
Take a pill for a headache and go to sleep, drink lots of water and vitamin C. Besides, I read somewhere that bananas are really good for the hangover, though I haven't tried it myself yet.
2 paracetamol and lots of water before bed. If that fails: Vomit if you feel like it, drink plenty of water, eat some greasy salty food and have a hot bath while keeping something cold on the back of your neck(like frozen peas wrapped in a towel. Then have a nap.
Have ice cold water as soon as you wake up, atleast 2 bottles within the first hour and then dig into some good food.
I don't get hangovers like other people get afaik. I don't wake up with a head ache or sore stomach, I wake up with a mouth that tastes like shit wrapped in burnt hair, an overwhelming sense of existential dread/anxiety and some suicidal ideation. It doesn't go away for 2-3 days and I have found 0 cure for it.
"Rarely had hangovers up until maybe 22. I'm 24 and since then I'm strictly trying to prevent it:

Not mixing drinks too much. If I start with beer, I can drink pálinka or vodka-orange/vodka-soda but nothing more. And still mainly beer so it's like 80% beer and 20% what I've mentioned.

Drinking something sour before going to bed. 100% (or close enough) orange juice, pickle juice (gross I know but it helps) or water. Order is based on effectiveness. Quantity is mostly 2 glasses.

Oh and I only tried pickled onion juice. Not the one you put cucumberr in to ferment. 

If these aren't enough, a shitton of sleep and a large breakfast including eggs + constantly drinking water."
"Let's make this clear:  there is no hangover cure.  If you drink, you are going to pay, it's as simple as that.

you can mitigate the suffering however.  Many have said water before bed, eggs when you wake up, but for me, the one thing I've found that actually makes a real difference is 5 Hour Energy and weed.  It seems to keep the waves to a minimum so it's just a low-level of suffering."
Drink less.  If this is a regular problem, maybe it's not worth the trouble.  Learn to have fun as yourself not your inebriated alter ego.
"Cup ramen, preferably beef, chicken, or soy sauce udon, with a handful of green onion added to the cup with the boiling water, and then top with a fresh eggs yolk

Alternatively, that egg yolk/dry gin drink from Cowboy Bebop"
Weed. I never smoked weed till I had a hangover, liked the feeling so much that I actually quit drinking and started smoking weed.
DONT have a greasy breakfast that makes you feel hungover and bloated and greasy and sick and like fucking shit. Eat loads of fresh fruit like pineapple. You’re so dehydrated and thirsty it also tastes soo good and nourishes your body. Have a green tea. Force down some water. Have a shower/bath and wash your hair and face. I like to do a sheet mask because they are so refreshing and hydrating.
"Shot of lemon into espresso. 

What I also do when I get really drunk, prior to sleeping I take one pill of ibuprofen."
Go to welding shop, take oxy-acetylene hoses, turn on straight oxygen and inhale it like you're hitting a joint.  Usually works pretty quick.  Or, hop on murdersickle and ride for a good 30-45 min.  All that air should get some oxygen back in you.
Just Carry on drinking and you won’t get hungover in the morning when you wake up. That’s what my uncle used to always say anyways
Water before bed and paracetamol. Then in the morning can of coke and a fry up, all that sugar and grease has healing properties or something.
"It depends on how drunk I went to sleep. Generally I take isotonic drink diluted with water 1:1, and fast food. Sometimes water and extra nap. If the headache is strong, because you drank wine or cheap alcohol, you could try a cold beer. The extra ethanol will help your headache caused for the methanol ingested/metabolized.
Cheers."
Fresh carrot, apple, ginger juice with a powdered greens supplement (I like Phresh Greens) 20 min and you’re normal again.
"So in dealing with hangovers prevention is key. But every once in a while we find ourself in that situation where the stars align, you completely forget about that sort of thing and then they hit you like an extinction level impact event in the morning.

How do you deal with it: **Bacon!**

You should always have emergency bacon read if you run the risk of a hangover. Some bread fried in the residue fat is also good.

Then you need to get water back in to you.

&#x200B;

Other than that I find that I usually crave fruits. A few grapes, strawberries or raspberries, a slice of apple or a small slice of melon. They are tasty, can all be eaten in small pieces and just help stir your appetite or give you a bit more energy.

&#x200B;

But other than that I have nothing really. If I had a universal cure I'd be rich. 

Luckily I get hangover drunk super rarely which is good because I'm approaching thirty and while they aren't quite as bad they get more and more drawn out it seems..

If I drink too much there is a two day recovery. One day for the hangover and then one day for recovering from the hangover."
Gatorade and weed upon waking up. If headache and nausea are present take 1/4 Dramamine. Will knock you out for a few hours and settle the stomach.
Keep on drinking, just at a slower rate, your body will adapt and you won't feel so hangover. It helps if once you start drinking you interval two to three drinks with a glass of water
"Just eat a banana and drink a glass of water before bed.  Hangovers are a lack of hydration AND potassium.  

Look at the back of those hangover cures... potassium.

But the real answer is don't drink lol.  Weed gives me zero hangovers.  43 and haven't been hungover since college."
"When you wake up, start drinking water, just keep drinking it, slowly if you have to. A bit of iced black coffee is nice too, but coffee is a diuretic so don't overdo it. 

Next try to eat something light that is easy to keep down, I prefer toast. 

After you've downed a bunch of water and eaten something light, you will eventually have an actual appetite, how long this takes depends on how bad the hangover is, just keep drinking water in the meantime. Once you have an appetite you are basically in the clear, give your body whatever horrible, shitty, greasy comfort food it's craving. 

Finally, if you are an anxious person like me you will probably have some mental hangover effects, ""hangxiety"" if you will. If you're like me you are probably going over in your head anything you said or did that was potentislly embarrassing. Once you're feeling well enough, take a shower, brush your teeth, I like to meditate for a bit, and do anything to get out of the house. Go for a bike ride, visit a friend, visit your parents, whatever you wanna do, stewing in the house with your thoughts will make your hangxiety last all weekend."
I’ve never actually been hungover. Whenever I’ve had to much whiskey I eat a large flank steak pan-fried in salted butter, put on a pair of wet sock and go to bed.
Avoid it altogether by leveling how much alcohol you drink with water. After every two drinks or so, have a pint of water. My parents told me this and regardless of how much I've drank I've never woken up with a hangover; usually just back pain from sleeping on a friend's floor or sofa post-party.
"Whatever sugary alcohol you can stomach, do about a shots worth (or less, that's just for me) and then switch to water and food. Fried potatoes are probably the move right now. 

ELI5: This works cause last night your body switched from sugar to alcohol and in the morning that sugary shot will tide your alcohol needs over and kickstart the sugary switch."
Everyone recommending food and drink while in reality it’s all about that charcoal coloured shit that restores order to the body.
Potassium, vitamin B, water, and salt. Ibuprofen for the headache if it hits. Water and electrolytes are the most important.
Before sleep, drink painkiller of your choice with lots of water. Maybe isn't the healthiest choice, but it works for me.
Sure water before sleep and all that... bit also have you tried chilaquiles for breakfast with a hangover? Cos if you haven’t you should.
A 4 or 6 pack of talks, chug some pedialite, smoke a little bit of weed to get your appetite going and then street tacos with extra limes, go home take two xanax, put on something stupid to watch (I usually watch Ancient Aliens or something like that), fall asleep on your couch. Wake up drink more pedialyte and prepare to start it all over again. The self isolation has not been very motivating.
Wake up, hate self for half an hour, drink 2 pints of water, have a wank, have a sit down shower and a little cry. Migrate to sofa and put on netflix.
I used to get terrible hangovers before I started drinking 2.5 litres of water a day. Now... i dont get them. Drink water whilst you drink. Have a beer, glass of water, beer, water. Or wine. But always drink the water.
If you haven't prepped the night before with loads of water and if carrying on drinking isn't an option. Cold shower, paracetamol, something sweet to drink and something salty to eat. Also, I find getting outside and moving is really helpful instead of staying in bed.
"
Bartenders breakfast.

Drink one muddy puddle:
1/2 pint of OJ mixed with a half pint of Coke Cola.

Sit on the top step next to the bins smoke a cigarette slowly focusing on the heat in the pits of your lungs. 

Walk back upstairs and get slammed hard on a 12 hour shift."
I’ve been drinking a lot of water with  Nuun tablets before bed . Those things are great , they’re effervescent electrolytes tablets . Makes a big difference
"The Mofo Party Plan!

800mg Ibuprofen, 1000mg Tylenol, Prilosec OTC, large gatorade,water and a greasy meal with coffee to wash it down;  nap after, good as new!

The Mofo Pre-party plan is everything above minus the greasy meal and coffee before you start drinking, in order to prevent or mitigate hangover."
The hangover is a type of alcohol poisoning, caused by excessive drinking. The way to prevent or cure a hangover is to avoid drinking to excess.
"For me, red foods help a little with hangovers.  Maybe it's the lycopene?  Things like chips and (tomato-based) salsa, bloody mary mix, watermelon.  In the case of watermelon it could just be the fact that it's got a lot of water in it.    

Obviously also drink a lot of water, and take ibuprofen.  

A good tip to prevent/reduce hangovers would be to alternate every alcoholic drink with a glass of water."
Never been hungover. After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, pan-fried in salted butter. I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks and go to sleep.
Aspirin the first time you wake up with a headache, and as much water as you can drink, then go back to sleep. When you wake up, stop being a fucking pussy and go about your day.
Grab a FitAid, pop 4 Align probiotics, 600 mg ibuprofen, and a chilled face mask. Sleep 2 hours. Wake up fine.
"This is gonna sound like total bs but a friend brought over yogurt for me while we were drinking, claiming that it cured hangovers. I tried it that night and dammit all if he was correct.

I've tested it a few times over these last few months. Sometimes I'll drink milk instead of yogurt and I switched up my choice of alcohol just to see if that would change anything. So far I haven't had a hangover since starting this so it's my new go-to miracle drug."
"Gatorade, 3 headache tablets before bed. If you wake up in the evening drink water like a beast. After you wake up feeling like satan sack tapped you in the face order something super greasy like a cheese burger or a massive pizza. Also drink lots of water during the day. 

Warning: side effects include crying and regretting life."
Magnesium will counteract the glutamate buildup in the brain. Be careful, magnesium is a laxative too.
"I recommend getting a new liver; I haven't had a hangover since 2014.
If you are unable to arrange this, try eating a large Frito Pie, at the end of the piss-up, before retiring for the night!"
Whenever I go drink outside which is rare considering my 27 year old liver isn't quite as efficient as my 16-18 yo liver,  I put a bottle of sparkling water in the fridge. Next morning when I wake up full of grief for the stuff I did last night, I squeeze one lemon in the bottle and drink it while it's cold. It makes you burp like crazy but it's quite refreshing and helps get through the worst.
"I discovered my perfect cure during a bad flu, oddly enough. Just a simple strawberry banana smoothie with ginger and ice in it. It has been my go-to hangover cure since. 

It has:

- one banana.
- quarter cup of strawberries.
- 1tsp of ground ginger to help with nausea.
- 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt.
- coconut water.
- ice, to your discretion.

Its bland enough to not upset your stomach, and the ginger is a godsend.  Just sip or drink that alongside a gallon of water, until the thought of actual food doesn't make you want to yak."
"Liter of pedialyte before you sleep.  Salty food plus H20 before bed is good.  Alcohol breaks down to acetaldehyde in the body.  This little fucker is thought to cause the hangover.  From my experience, if you can keep the ratio of acetaldehyde lower relative to blood volume (ie staying very hydrated) you can prevent most of the negative effects of a hangover.  Having liquid with .9% sodium will help raise you’re blood volume and lower the ratio of acetaldehyde in the blood, hence why salty food and water is good.  Pedialyte is a .9% sodium solution, but also has the correct amount of other electrolytes, which is why it is my gold standard for effective hydration.  Obviously this method has limits on the extreme end of alcohol consumption, so please don’t overdose i
on water or pedialyte if your 20 drinks deep 😎"
"Nothing cures a hangover, you can only mitigate it.
Get as much sleep as possible, drink a lot of water, put something in your stomach the next morning. I find anything “heavy” will do the trick (home fries are my go-to). 

Eat the food before you drink coffee."
"Woof, at this point (30) if I I really tie one off I’m bedridden the day after and get brain fog/60% operating brain power the following day. Point being, only have a few drinks and don’t get to that point.

If it’s just a few drink hangover though, slamming a pedialyte throughout the night/as soon as I wake up, eating a big breakfast, napping, then a workout to sweat it out."
"Drink water before bed.
And when you wake up hungover, get an isotonic drink, Gatorade or something. 
Also try to rest as much as you can the next day."
Irn Bru. Pizza delivered as soon as you can get it. More irn bru. Throw some painkillers in lie on the sofa feel sorry for yourself the whole day and watch crap TV
"Honey toast sandwich
You can put some honey on toast next to your omelet. According to Britain's Royal Society of Chemistry, while it won't cure a hangover, the breakfast can help alleviate the symptoms. The BBC talked to a junior doctor about this hangover remedy, and he recommended adding banana."
"Who else can guarantee that their’s works?

Ingredients:
-white bread
-mayonnaise
-sliced ham
-sliced tomatoes
-Tapatio hot sauce (life nectar when hungover)

Instructions:

1. Add mayo to bread, both sides
2. Add Tapatio to the mayo and mix it on the bread with a spoon or something
3. Add sliced ham and tomatoes
4. Enjoy

*EDIT*
Spicy foods tricks the body into thinking it’s under attack so the hangover gets dealt with as a side effect of your body defending itself against the hot sauce. I forget the actual science but that’s the gist of it."
"A run. 

As hard as it is to pull myself out of bed and get going with a splitting headache and/or nausea, nothing beats sweating the rest of that shit out of your system (and you smell like a distillery when you get home which is always funny)"
"If you want to prevent the hangover, drink 1-2 liters of water before going to sleep. 

If you have a hangover, in Mexico we eat something called ""menudo"" which is a spicy soup made of the stomach of a beef."
"Back in 1999 I read a New Scientist article on this.  A scientific study on hangover cures.  

Water before you sleep helps.  

A “full Irish/English breakfast” (or fast food) works. Something to do with your body metabolising fat.  

And, believe it or not, hair of the dog (ie, a drink) **works**.  Again, something about kickstarting the body’s ability to metabolise alcohol.  Don’t start drinking again though.  So just that single beer or Bloody Mary.  


All the rest were bullshit."
the best hands down no argument hang over cure is to drink one glass of alcohol and one water, alcohol, water.... repeat through the event. you will never wake up with a hangover.
Magnesium Pill and a half litre of water before you sleep, shower and another half litre immediatly after waking up. If i drank a ton more water and ibuprofen before and after sleep
Drink lots of water before bed and try and drink water between drinks when you are getting blotto too.
Woke up in the middle of winter with a massive hangover. For some reason, the snow outside looked really appetizing to me so I went out and ate some. Cured my hangover immediately. I recommend it to everyone.
"Ice cream.

Controversial but the cold cools and the cream
Lines my stomach (in my mind at least it works).

As for the headache... water is your friend!"
Pedialyte.  Get one of the big bottles.  Drink as much as you can before bed and drink some more in the morning.  Then get yourself a bacon egg and cheese.
Drink lots of water before bed and when you wake up in the middle of the night. In the morning, take a shower and wash your hair. Then go eat a burger and drink a Coke.
Brit entry here: an extra strong cup of nice hot tea (as in, left to brew for about 20 mins and strong enough to stand a spoon in), Marmite on hot buttered toast, and a bottle of blue Powerade to wash down a couple of paracetamol.
"Eat a ton of bread and drink a ton of water before sleeping. Get up as soon as you wake up (at a reasonable time and after enough sleep, of  course), drink more water, take a shower and enjoy a harthy breakfast afterwards.

Edit: throwing up after drinking (before the water and bread) works wonders when you want to avoid a hangover but I wouldn't exactly call that great advice."
Pedialyte/water before bed and marijuana is when I wake up. The smoking gets rid of the stomach/headaches.
Heaps of water before you hit the hay and a shower where you adjust the water every now and then so it's slightly cold, slightly warm etc etc.
"Keep drinking! I've heard there is some basis for this, since the digestion of alcohol happens in multiple steps and some byproducts get you hungover. When there is still alcohol in the blood these products will not be generated (as fast), so keep on drinking!

unless you actually have to do certain stuff, such as driving.."
Put a bottle of Gatorade and four generic white aspirin next to your bed before you start drinking. Take two aspirin and drink half the bottle of Gatorade before you go to bed and take the other two aspirin and drink the rest of the Gatorade when you wake up. Then coffee or some kind of caffeine to get you to the shower. After shower, my preference is a cheeseburger and fries to soak up the booze. Also order a red beer, which is a cold beer mixed with tomato juice. Go home and take a nap.
Drink water right when you wake up and take a cold shower. Eat something greasy or something like ramen or pho. I usually get a mama burger with bacon and fries and a root beer. That’s gets the job done.
"Drink water and eat while drinking alcohol.
Avoid sugary alcohol drinks.
Take NAC.

Or, better, take some phenibut instead."
Drinking some water between each pint of beer or glass of whiskey helps alot. But for a hangover the next day, my go to cure is a couple tylenol, a bottle of blue powerade, and a crunch wrap from taco bell
Double order of waffle house hashbrowns with ham, cheese, onion and chili on top. Perfect amount of grease plus you will take a massive booboo afterwards to get the demons out.
"I don't drink any longer, but used to drink pretty heavily for a long, long time.

My cure: drinking water along with the alcohol, eating something before or while drinking, taking a single naproxen sodium (Aleve) before going to sleep, and sports drink the next day.  Worked a treat for me."
"Preemptively, if you manage to be so prepared, drink a shitload of water, orange juice or Berocca before bed, as well as eating plenty (a big old greasy takeaway beef burger tends to do the trick) before bed.

But in terms of after you've woken up:

Bacon.

Lots and lots of bacon. With dry toast is good, but if you don't feel like you can really stomach even that, then just like a whole pack of bacon.

Extreme cases call for oral rehydration supplements or migraine-relief tablets.

Also sitting in the shower is a good temporary fix, but it kind of just distracts you from how bad you're feeling whilst you're in there. You'll be back to feeling rough again once you get out. Unless you eat bacon."
Drink a glass of pedialyte for every 2 drinks you have. I get miserable hangouts, but when I do this I feel like I'm a kid again
"Chug 24-36 oz of water before going to bed, then get as much sleep as you can.  

Wake up, have more water or better yet something like BioLyte which is way better than Gatorade.  

Eat a banana first then something greasy.

Get off your ass and do something productive even if you feel bad."
You can avoid the hangover by staying hydrated. If you already have the hangover, take ibuprofen (may not be great for your already fucked liver, but it'll do the trick) chased down by two large glasses of water, take a very hot shower for at least 10 minutes, and go to sleep for as long as you're able.
a big glass of water to wash down an advil and a super B vitamin before bed. works wonders. bacon and egg Sammy in the morning.
I force myself to drink and entire liter of water before I go to bed as well as having a sandwich so the bread will help. I’d rather prevent than endure
"While living in Japan, I would always stop at a convenience store after a night of drinking for a small gold bottle of something called ""ukon no chikara"", which means ""the power of turmeric"". I'd just down it right there in the store and walk home, I found it made the next morning much more tolerable. Also stock up on some bread products to soak up the poison in my stomach and go for ramen the next day."
Running. It makes the hangover speed through your body and it's all gone in 20 minutes. I always feel great after.
Shot glass amount of water mixed with salt. It helps your body retain all the water your gonna drink. If you can’t do the salt and water then drink some pickle juice.
Soup, orange juice or similar, and if possible, pasta bolognese (very specific, I know). There’s something about the tomato sauce that makes me come back to life. But with soup and orange juice you should be fine
"Work out a ratio of water to alcohol. I usually have a glass per beer and if I get a little too boozy I'll take an ibuprofen before bed so my head isn't pounding and inflamed in the morning. Dehydration and brain swelling is all a hangover really is. Easier option, stop drinking and shmerk a berl ;	)"
Gatorade, man! It'll keep you functioning, give you electrolytes, and let you slowly recover. Gatorade: For athletes and drunks!
Water before bed, wake up to a joint, Gatorade and another 90 mins of sleep to start the day off right.
"Hangovers are a result of dehydration.

If you drink a lot of water durring the night you won't have a hang over the next day. For every beer I drink, I drink a glass of water."
"Simple. 

Not drinking in the first place. I simply can't afford the trouble it'll bring even without the possibility of a hangover."
"My hangover cure always used to be a cornish pasty, chicken and mushroom pot noodle and then downing a ice cold can of coke.

Then lots of water during the day. The pot noodle has alot of salt so helps replace things it's also a pint of water essentially. The cornish pasty is meat and potato's with pastry, they are filling but kind of bland so not to hard to eat and will fill you up. Coke for caffeine and sugar whilst also being cold and refreshing.

That being said none of these things help with the hangover anxiety"
Drink Lots water before going to bed. More water when you wake Up. Then take 300mg caffeine, eat some fruit. Next go for a run followed by a shower and a kebab
My method is preemptive. Prior to bed, take two Tylenol with a full glass of water, sleep for 6-8 hours, wake up and have another glass of water and then after about 30 minutes, have a double shot of pickle juice
This will get downvoted to hell probably. In my own personal experience, the best “cure” was prevention. It took a long time, but I realized just limiting my intake was the only road forward. It dawned on me one day that hangover cures are literally no different than figuring out the best way to recover from intentional poisoning (which ethyl alcohol essentially is for the body). Just my two cents, I’m out
"Lots and lots of juice. Alcohol causes dehydration and fucks with your glucose levels and electrolytes. 

I like having some fast food, some hair of the dog and then go do something.

Laying around doesn’t usually help unless you are like still puking."
A lot of water before falling asleep. 8+ hours of sleep. Greasy breakfast and a smoothie to replace micro nutrients. Bloody mary if necessary--hair of the dog + salt helps with water absorption.
I buy a bunch of those cheap ready to microwave rice bags and have one of them with water before bed. Soaks everything up nice while I sleep
"1. don't go to sleep dehydrated, stay up late if necessary drinking water.

2. wake up early and/or when you have to pee, and have 2 ibuprofen and another huge glass of water, and go back to bed. 

3. Tom Kha soup broth for breakfast. It's mind bendingly delicious and gets food into you even if you're nauseated.

4. If you aren't then going to work, quick hit off a joint can help with the nausea and general discomfort otherwise. 

5. this doesn't work for me, but many people say that a heavy, cheesey, greasey breakfast soaks up the alcohol. to each his own."
"The best approach is to be proactive. Stay hydrated while drinking and drink something with electrolytes before bed. Still waiting for Gatorale to be a thing. 

PSA: Something I have done is take some tylenol before going to bed. I feel fine the next day but apparently it is really bad for your liver and kidneys so i don't recommend."
Hair of the dog. I've really come to favor a small glass of fernet branca in the morning to get myself right.
If you have enough time to prepare do all this otherwise try to do as much as you can but the most important is water. In order of importance: Before bed, drink a liter of water preferably with the juice of a squized lemon. Take 2-3 grams of DHM powder (aka ampelopsin, this is good). If you can, also drink half a liter of cucumber juice (helps with hydration) and another half a liter of celery juice (hydration + electrolytys + gut clearing and easing) before bed. Eat bananas or any high fructose fruits (energy for the body and liver) before bed. Before drinking take 500mg of alcar (neuron protection). Source: experience of 10+ years of social binge drinking in the weekend while looking to minimise the damage. Thank me later.
Before you go to bed drink as much water as you think you can hold down and 2 aspirin. Real aspirin, not tylenol or advil, old fashioned aspirin. More water as soon as you roll out of bed. Makes a huge difference.
After having too much alcohol, I cook myself a huge flank steak, pan fried, and salted butter. I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks, and go to sleep.
"Two ibuprofen and as much water as you can drink without throwing up before you go to sleep. You'll never have a hangover again.

I'd force my friends in college to do it when we'd bar hop. It always works."
A liter of cocowater before bed is 100% effective. Less so when taken after you wake up but it still works. So much better than gatorade.
Drink plenty of water the night before, sleep well, drink more water in the morning. Or you could just not get fucked up and stop after a drink or 2.
Not a cure but preventative, borage oil. I bought some off amazon and I swear take 2 an hour or two before drinking and I’d wake up completely fine the next day. They are my go to back when anime cons were a thing before a Covid.
"
I have different ways depending on how much I’m going to drink.

 If I want to get shitfaced

I start drinking as early as possible but stop before 12am if I can.

I also start having water inbetween the alcohol, either after I start feeling really drunk or halfway through the evening.

I eat a ton of food and drink even more water before I go to bed, and piss and shit if I can so I don’t have to get up later.

If I go to bed without having water and food, My hangovers get 100x worse, and I get them much easier too. Never again."
"Drink 1-2 glasses or bottles of water before bed if you can, I know this isn't always possible or a good idea depending on how much you drank though so in the morning once I'm already hungover Apple juice really helps rehydrate me. Also Excedrin Migraine and if possible some carbs like toast.

If it's the end of the night, Apple juice and hot McDonald's fries do wonders for me."
Pop a painkiller for the headache and go sit on the shower floor for 15-20mins in hot water. The hot water hitting the top of your head/body makes you not feel your headache (at least for me) after that I drink a shit load of water and go back to sleep. Sometimes i may take a water bottle with me to the shower as well.
To me it’s sports, especially going for a swim. When dive into the cool water you great again, a yes and hangover sex is also great once your senses have come back. Then you finish off an active day with a good dinner and saved ;)
"The main problem is that you're dehydrated. Everyone here is saying drink water before going to bed.
Yes, this helps but the best way to even avoid the hangover (short of not drinking in excess) is that once your start getting drunk, have 1 glass of water per alcoholic drink.

That way you hydrate as you go along.

The follow everyone's advice about drinking alot of water before bed. Drinking lots of water when you get up, get some grease and some electrolytes in there too.

Tldr: drink water at the same time as having alcohol."
Drink water and brush teeth before bed. Wake up. Annadin Extra. Something easy and fulfilling to eat (bacon sandwich/tomato soup/beans on toast). Smoothie. Lots of water throughout the day and maybe more Annadin. Sorted.
Salted pumpkin seeds, a banana, and a ton of Gatorade the next morning. The salt, magnesium, potassium, and electrolytes get replaced real fast. It has worked for me every time - and I have had to use this cure a LOT of times.
Wake and bake. Marijuana to cover up the hangover. And then Pedialyte, Gatorade, Water and some decent food. I try to skip the greasy food to give my stomach a rest after too much booze
Caffeine pill, Advil and water. I know the Advil is not great for your liver, so exercise best judgement on that.
"Gatorade, Pedialyte, Body Armor- anything with electrolytes to be honest. Even better to use these as mixers instead of the morning after

If you really tryna to get twisted with no hangover I recommend Titos and Gatorade. Top tier beverage"
"Drink water before you go to bed and then more as soon as you wake up.

When you get up, get a can of full fat coke - not diet, and make a bacon sandwich.

Alcohol dehydrates you and afaik it fucks up your electrolyte balance and blood sugar so once you get those sorted you'll feel much better."
Grilled bagel breakfast sandwich with sausage combo with a hash brown and Double Double from Tim Horton’s.
Scientifically some pickle juice and water, and eat a banana to get the nutritions and electrolytes back in your system and an full English breakfast just because.
can of Coke or any other drink with a high content of sugar, ibuprofen and omeprazole before falling asleep
Don’t go straight to bed after your last drink, but maybe walk a mile, get some water and food first. Really curbs the hangover.
Greasy food. Fast food breakfast or burger or whatever. In addition to water and all that noise but mostly the greasy food.
I take 1 Gravol before going to sleep after drinking and I usually wake up early even if I'm super drunk the night before, so I drink a lot of water and take another Gravol. It has anti histamine properties so it'll make you sleep. After that nap, you'll feel so much better.
"2 bullion cubes in a mug of hot water.

Makes like a super salty broth that gives you everything you need.

Also makes you pee out your ass if you over do it though, so moderation is kinda the by word"
"While drinking: ice water with lemon between drinks, handful of chips between those. 
Before bed: bottle of blue Gatorade dumped into a huge cup of ice, two Tylenol if I'm already feeling a headache. If I wake up in the middle of the night, I drink the melted ice.
In the morning: sausage egg mcmuffin, hashbrown in the sandwich, small black coffee. I'm usually fine so it's not like it's necessary; just more of a ritual at this point."
"Don't drink so much in the first place. Bang. No more hangovers. I know..I'm a genius. Hold your applause.

Probably gunna get downvoted to shit.

Edit: If I drink I drink for the taste. I see no point in getting drunk. Maybe a little loose but not drunk. Maybe it's just me"
"Huge potassium smoothie: 1 banana, 4 oz orange juice, 4 oz vanilla yogurt or plain yogurt +big tsp. sugar, 6 oz ice. Machine blend. 
(Can sub ice water and blend by hand)"
Nobody mentioning my cure is somewhat disappointing. I used to go for a frozen pizza (bake it in the oven for 20 minutes, for others from Norway mostly grandiosa, and you buy it at the same time as you buy your beer). And you can go for cola or water to drink. The pizza has everything you need except for liquids so your drink doesn't matter much. Pizza has carbs in the crust tons of fat in the cheese and meat and protein in the meat.
I find that what is commonly called a McGang Bang is the ultimate cure a Jr. Chicken sammiched between a McDouble. With lots of water. The only problem is waiting for the lunch menu to be served... You have all day breakfast why not all day everything!?
Most of the worst effects of a hangover (besides the brain damage) is dehydration.  So drink a bunch of water with a pinch of salt and it will help tons.  Especially if you remember to drink it right to before going to sleep.
"Chug obscene amounts of water before bed.  Like until you can't drink any more.  Bonus points for Pedialyte or Gatorade.  Eat 200-500 calories worth of some generic carby food like Pop Tarts or pretzels.  Sleep 6 hours minimum.  Preferably 7-8.  Drink more water immediately after waking up.  Shower, eat breakfast, eggs and toast or oatmeal is good.  Drink energy drink.  Resume day.

This is my go-to method."
I always wake up in the middle of the night when I drink too much because alcohol fucks with sleep.  When that happens, I gulp down two glasses of water and I'm usually fine by morning.
"drinking a cup of water between each drinks

I'm doing this when I drink alone and cry while creeping on the floor"
I agree with most of the comments but there is occasionally a hangover that just seems unrecoverable. That's when you double-down and just have 2 or 3 more drinks. You'll still feel like shit but you'll care less about it.
Pre emptive drinking of water and a bit of painkillers before going to sleep. Prevention is better than cure after all.
I just drink water in between every 2 drinks.  It's annoying to go to the bathroom a lot but I've avoided hangovers for YEARS because of that.  Especially during the time I spent in the service... all we did on our free time was go out and get hammered... don't wait till you're about to pass out to drink water
"Water or gatorade before bed.  

AM, pancakes/french toast.  Eggs, bacon and a coke.  The coke is key.  The syrup in it calms the stomach, the caffeine wake you up and handles the headaches.  The folic acid in all the starches as well as the proteins and fats replace a lot of the shit lost to the intoxication."
Pickles. Drink some of the pickle juice as well. Somehow a miracle cure. The tough part is trying to tell people this works and they look at you like you are crazy
For me it’s drinking water while drinking booze, then sleep, then Advil, coffee and a hot shower the next morning. I’m 32 and that usually does the trick.
Wake and bake if you can. Meaty brothy soup for breakfast- pho, kimchi jigae, pozole, menudo, etc. Lots of water. This is the hardest part: some sort of cardio. A good 20 minute run would do it, but a sport like soccer or basketball is even better to keep your mind off how much your body and you hate each other. But not until after you've had breakfast and lots of water.
Hangovers are mostly caused by dehydration. So, you can limit your hangover by drinking a glass of water for every alcoholic bev. Sleep also helps a lot.
Either Chinese food or Taco Bell and just so much cold water. Coooooold water. Before I go to sleep and when I wake up.
Stop drinking alcohol forever. Best decision I’ve ever made in my life. I am a recovering alcoholic so it was an easier decision in my case. But the average drinker should seriously consider whether drinking is even worth it.
"Start with orange juice. 

Follow with some eggs, bread and bacon/sausage.

Throw in a hash brown.

Keep drinking orange juice."
When we had kids, we started keeping that concentrated electrolyte solution around.  It works wonders.  You just water it down and it tastes like apple juice.  A couple of glasses before bed, and again when you wake up, and you're golden.
Thankfully, I don't get horrific hangovers, drink a glass of water before sleep, eat something when you wake up, preferably something fried, a bacon roll goes a long way, maybe some coffee and some painkillers if you have a headache.
I know this has been said a million times, but it really is water, all the water in the world. Before you go to sleep, chug until you're basically sick. If you wake up, try not to bump into things when you get a glass. Once you actually wake up in the morning, you know it, but also eat as much as you can, chances are you haven't eaten in over 12 hours.
Like a lot of people here are saying, drink lots of water before you go to bed. However, it works best if you start earlier - drink a glass of water between each alcoholic beverage throughout the evening. Sometimes, if you've really had a lot, waiting until bedtime to drink water may not be good enough.
Lo-salt mixed with water + mio/flavoring agent first thing in the AM, also just lots of water in general both days and just in general to stay hydrated. Little sugar can help, as well. Pickle juice helps in a pinch, just chug some.
Drink a big glass of water before you pass out, then drink another big glass of water when you wake up, along with a Percocet and some cannabis.
"Not getting  a hangover, make sure you eat before drinking, drink water before and during after consuming alcoholic beverages.  


If you do get a hangover, pedialyte/cerasport/whatever, excedrin, and  coffee. You're hungover because you're dehydrate, pedialyte/etc. provides electrolytes and water, excedrin provides pain relief and caffeine to make it work faster, and coffee provides more caffeine and something more enjoyable that pedialyte."
Cup full of ice, squeeze a lime in the cup, add Squirt (soda), add salt. DRINK with 4 200mg ibuprofen
approaching 40. for me there are two things that work ok: 1- drink as much water as you can before going to sleep. 2- take a nap after lunch the next day. the nap really seems to help. alcohol ruins my sleep, so getting some sober sleep - even just a little - goes a long way.
I love to eat Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches. It makes me sweat out the liquor and it fills my stomach. But that's only if my stomach allows me to eat.
Just remember to dehydrate and maybe eat something fat for breakfast. I remember the only time I ever woken up with a hangover I made myself a massive burger, had a glass of water, and went straight back to sleep for about 45mins. Everything was amazing after that.
"Tons of water before bed. Wake up, more water, multivitamin, ibuprofen, and sweat. Walk or try to do something physical to produce a strong sweat.

In a perfect world, I'd step into a sauna. Cures my  hangovers in twenty minutes."
Prevention, via metadoxine after drinking. It accelerates metabolism of the neurotoxic ethanol metabolites that cause hangovers.
First you have to prep 24 hours in advance. Do this by ensuring you have cold Gatorade in the fridge (atleast 2) and headache meds. I recommend liquid gels or BC powder. The night you drink, before you go to sleep drink like 2 glasses of water. The morning you wake up hungover immediately take 2 liquid gels and chug one Gatorade like your shooting one of those late ‘90 early 2000’s Gatorade commercials. If you have/smoke pot I’d recommend that also. Chill hard for an hour or so. Take another 2 liquid gels and sip on the second Gatorade. Get food you can eat, for me it’s Bojangles chicken, though I usually eat only one piece and crush the fries. I recommend a drink with sugar in it (sweet tea or non diet drinks) This together will kick a hangovers ass. If that fails, bite the bullet and do the BC powder. It’s disgusting but it works wonders.

Just squeegees out your intestines!"
Drink a bottle of Pedialyte before going to sleep, fill it up with water after. Wake up to piss in a couple hours, drink the water. Refill. Wake up and drink the water again, take a shit, then still get a hangover. Realize nothing works to cure a hangover and get back to drinking, pussy.
Fried fish (preferable kibbeling (for dutchies)) and sprite. It had fat, salt, sugar & water.. that most def kills all hangovers
Drink Gatorade before bed. Wake up and take an excedrine. Drink more Gatorade. Go get coffee and a bacon or sausage breakfast sandwich somewhere. Take nap if time allows.
"Electrolytes. 

2 pouches of Dioralyte in 2 glasses of water before bed. Same after I wake up. The only cure that I could say makes a big difference."
I stopped drinking sugary drinks on nights I know I'm gonna drink a lot. No more rum and coke, no more screwdrivers, etc. Straight whiskey or vodka with club soda and lime. If I'm drinking beer, then the first beer I have that night is the brand/ style I'm sticking to. If I'm just having a couple of drinks while out to dinner or something, then bring on the sugary bright colored drinks.
"Bacon, eggs and toast. At least a pint of water. Coffee. And I also have vitamin juice (I take effervescent vitamins, they're awesome). Painkillers for a headache if I have one bad enough. And if I can, naps throughout the day. Graze on savoury snacks. More water. 

Don't even make me laugh if you want me to be useful. I passed the years of being able to bounce back and be productive far too long ago. Nowadays a hangover is like at least a two day affair. One to be vaugely ill with a headache, and onther one still unreasonably tired."
My go to cure is to wake up, put on sunglasses, chug a glass of water, smoke a joint, eat a big ass Caesar salad with lots of croutons and a side of fries, sit in a hot shower in the dark and let the water pour over you, then go back to bed.
Preemptively: ibuprofen. Stops your brain from swelling and thus you from getting a headache and improves your sleep. Doctors advice against it though because long-term use have been linked with depression and ulcers. So there’s that.
If you drink water while you’re drinking alcohol, you will never have a hangover. Wish I would have learned this when I was younger.
"Getting older, hangovers got steadily worse up until the point where I just decided it wasn't worth it any more.  I know the point where I'll be looking at a hangover the next day, and these days I just take it easy when I'm approaching that.

That being said, food and water the night before is the next best prevention.  Good before you drink, food before you go to bed, and as much water as you can force down yourself.

The next morning I go for sweet fatty food and again as much water as I can."
"1. Water + snacks before bed 
2. Wake up, chug a couple of glasses of water, take Excedrin (to get the caffeine without the dehydrating effects of coffee) and take 2-3 bites of something bland (banana, toast, cracker) 
3. Go back to sleep as long as possible
4. Drink more water, and hot shower. I will literally sit on the floor of the bathtub with the shower on with my eyes closed (I do this for migraines, too) and try to breathe in the steam. 
5. Eat, pray for relief, and swear never to drink again."
Good Lord did people start drinking yesterday? Night of drinking make sure you have a glass of water every 2 hours or so. Morning after drink a pint of water in the morning and make yourself a bacon sandwich with extra bacon. I rarely if ever get hangovers but this is the cure
Prairie oyster when you wake up, chug a dank IPA while sitting in a hot shower an hour later, never stop on water after that
Bike ride with a hydration pack so youre thirsty in the morning but still can hold down liquids because of strenuous activity.
"Look, as others have stated, drinking water inbetween drinks or before you go to bed go a long way.  But if you forget, then...

Haystack.


Cut a grands biscuit in half.  Place next to each other on the plate.  Put hash browns, sausage, and bacon over top.  Pour gravy over top of all that.  Then put two fried eggs on top of the gravy.  Enjoy.

Hangover gone within an hour."
"There's this drink over here in Mexico, called Clamato (has clam juice and other stuff). It's also sold a lot in the USA, but there's this one flavor called ""Vuelve a la vida"" and goddamn does that cure my hangover.

I also drink a glass of milk before going to sleep and take some pills and bam! Wake up like new

Also, shotgun a beer and bye bye hangover."
A bunch of water and a multivitamin before bed if you remember to. In the morning go to your nearest deli/cornerstore/bodega and get the greasiest, dirtiest breakfast sandwich they have along with a gatorade or some kind of sugary drink of choice. Take a shower right after to clean the grease and shame off and you should feel like a human being again.
Cold shower and the coke from something like Mc Donald's or another Fast food place where you can fill up as much as you want.
Avoid them entirely by drinking vodka mixed with Pedialyte.  You get hangovers because alcohol dehydrates you, not because you get drunk.
Not so much a cure as it is a prevention measure: drink a shit ton of water before sleeping. The one and only time I didn't drink water before sleeping was the only time I got a massive hangover so far. This works for me, at least.
Learn how much you're able to drink before you get a hangover, and then limit yourself to that amount when you go out.
I don’t get hangovers no matter how much I drink but I do wake up incredibly tired which results in dizziness. I just drink a Gatorade and take a shower and I’m good as new
If I know I’m going on a bender (which is about every other day now with quarantine/furlough) I drink as much water as I can plus an electrolyte drink like Gatorade or electrolit before I start. I try to stick to the rule of limited mixing of different alcohol/not so many sugary drinks. If I’m on a wine bender I try to drink extra water. My hangovers are very limited and usually occur if I don’t stay hydrated or mix different drinks all night. I’m 28 for reference
"Always have in your mind the night before that you'll need to function the day after. This does not mean that you should cut massively down on the drinks, I don't. What I mean by this is, that if you have something that you look forward to be doing the day after, or need to do, you will not be just as tired or destroyed when you wake up.

Other than that: Drink 3-4 glasses of water, and bring a bottle up in bed, and chug that before going to sleep. It really helps.

It works for me"
Breakfast sandwich(sausage/egg/cheddar/English muffin) followed by drinking a Mnt. Dew in the hot shower then flip it to ice cold and stand there for 60 seconds. Done and done
Wake up slowly,  take your time and adjust to your surroundings. Start drinking beer. Three beers in,  get out the coke. Roll a spliff. Smoke that. Shower! Head out for a big boozy lunch with friends. (You should start to feel the hangover slip away) Cheers!
Get up, have a drink, but not too much and possibly a small bit of breakfast. Then go for a shit, go for a 3 mile run (or more eif you fancy) so you start to sweat it out and it also tires you out physically. Have a shower, cos if you didn't stink before, you definitely do now. Now stuff your face with food and drink as much as you can (but not caffeine). Then go back to sleep, alcohol inhibits REM sleep, so a nap helps boost that back up. Wake up and start the day again.
Back when I would drink... it was a large coke from McDonald's and a large fry. Its the sugar, salt, fat combo that does the trick.
"I was an alcoholic for years, here is what I learned:

Prevention is the best cure. Drink a Powerade or Gatorade before bed, Pedialyte if you're really desperate. Water is good but on its own doesn't replace the electrolytes that you lose from drinking a lot.

DON'T take acetaminophen (Tylenol) with any alcohol in your system or [it can fuck up your liver](https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/acetaminophen-alcohol#).

Ibuprofen (Advil) can be bad too [if you have too much alcohol in your system or take too much ibuprofen](https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/ibuprofen-alcohol#ibuprofen-and-alcohol).

[Aspirin is also bad when mixed with alcohol](https://www.healthline.com/health/aspirin-alcohol#risks).

Honestly I'd be hesitant to take any pill with alcohol in my system.

If it's too late for prevention then Powerade/ Gatorade can still help. Pain killers can be used once the alcohol is out of your system. You're probably not dehydrated, but your nutrient levels are low.

Food helps restore your nutrient levels and your blood sugar, so eat some comfort food (you already drank hundreds of excess calories, what's a few more?)."
"I have not had a single hangover in my life, and I've been carried home black-out drunk more than once. 


I have no clue what the magic is."
Before I go to bed I slam a sports drink which helps a lot just on it's own. When I wake up, if I have the time. I'll drink a can on V8 vegitable juice, a glass of water and 2 advil then get an extra hour of sleep. If I don't have the time I skip the sleep. And of course, greasy breakfast food if possible.
Honestly after I had children my hangover became atrocious. I used to go out Sundays for brunch with my fiance and his mom and for that reason I would just drink only on Saturdays. Next morning before buffet 2 glasses ice water or very cold ginger ale, shower dress, out to eat immediately order a v8 or tomato juice with tobasco sauce,  eggs, toast, bacon, and sausage, and homfries, and an oj. Of course coffee too. Did me right well.
"Get back on it you fucking pussy!

In all seriousness, pretty much every hangover issue is a symptom of dehydration. Bit of water dotted about through the night and a pint or so (slowly, don't be sick) before bed will make all the difference. 

In the morning, Lucozade sport will help no end in the short term, but if you cane it you'll get a sugar crash and that will be the worst you'll ever feel

You get a headache because the lack of water makes your brain shrink slightly and it pulls on the nerves that hold your brain to your skull."
(2) activated charcoal capsules and water before bed. Morning after is weed, a Slurpee, and a breakfast sandwich.
"I have a bad habit of not eating when I drink, so I always try and eat something about an hour before I have to go to bed.  Also, drinking a cup or two of water before helps too.  

When waking up: More water, defecate if you can, shower, brush teeth, and eat something that wont make you feel like crap but has weight to it.  

Oh, and marijuana.  Lots of marijuana."
My go to was a shower and a cold beer, a Caesar (the drink), eggs and toast, B vitamin complex, a good movie to distract from the shakes and Lorazepam.
"Been looking for it, haven't seen it. Old boss who's from Alabama swore up and down by Goody's powder. Take it straight and then wash it down with some water. Dude always carried a Goody's powder in his wallet.

If I know in advance I've got some hard drinking ahead of me always go to the store beforehand and pick up either a carton of chicken broth or tomatoes soup and heat up a cup of that the following morning. If you can try and eat some bread with it."
"Fucking all day if you're with someone who's into that as well, minging Chinese food, smoking weed and starting to drink again around 3pm.

Or if its one of those days where you must feel better then a brutal 2 hour workout finished with a sauna. A few pints on the way home.

Lol."
"Taco Bell. Sounds insane and I didn't believe it either, but it actually calms the stomach. 

A couple of chewable baby aspirin, gatorade and some cool water for the headache."
"There are only two tried-and-true solutions:

1. Finish your night with water.

2. Start your day with booze."
Waffle House's Texas Bacon Cheese Steak Melt. Get onions, mushrooms, gravy, and cheese on the hash browns. Tabasco if you desire, I prefer it. Drink is unsweetened ice tea.
Drink half a pint of water every 2-3 alcoholic drinks while you are out. Upon getting home, a glass of water and some ibuprofen should be enough to prevent the hangover. If you still manage to be hungover, more ibuprofen when you wake up, vitamin c, vitamin b and some sushi should do the trick.
Stop drinking before you start. “I had enough already,” is what I say when offered a drink. Believe me, I have had enough for 3 lifetimes already, and I don’t need anymore.
"20's just start drinking again

30's water,water and where's my god damn mcgriddle

40's  I don't want to play anymore.  Suffer through the cold sweats and shakes, make it to lunch, lets not do this again."
There is a pre alcohol drink going round called yeti and the fox . I haven’t tried it but my friends swear it works and when they have it before a night out they don’t get hang overs the next day.
A glass or two of water and a glass of Pedialyte before you pass out, then the same thing when you wake up.
"A run or cycle.

I usually pound as much water as I can, then go for a run or get on the stationary bike and pound out some miles. I barely sweat, but what I do sweat (at least in my mind) is the toxins from whatever I drank the night before. Afterwards, I already feel much less hungover, I’ve cleansed myself, and I can begin re-hydrating and becoming a living human being again."
Drink half a biolyte before bed, rest when you wake up. Still feeling like shit? Eggs and toast fried in bacon grease.
Hangovers are caused primarily by dehydration I think,  sports drinks will help a lot.  Pink pepto bismol dry tablets (generic brand works just as well) can help with any nausea.  That and some simple food like plain toast or rice.
Easy, mask the hangover with half a dozen screwdrivers, after all, breakfast is important. By the time lunch rolls around I'll be ready for the bloody marys. I try to eat light at dinnertime with neat vodka and ice.
"Hair of the dog. Not lad-mode binge drinking, just a few drinks throughout the day. Add a dash of baileys or whiskey to your morning coffee, have a beer with lunch and a glass of wine with dinner. It takes the edge off and but isn't enough to give you a hangover the next day.

Bailey's coffee is my favourite for particularly rough hangovers. Beer can be a challenge but Bailey's coffee always goes down a treat.

Not get drunk in the first place. Of course, I am an alien and not a real human, which is why the Earthling pastime of getting intoxicated in spite of all the unpleasant side effects of alcohol is something I fail to see the pleasure in. Now if you'll excuse me, I must go and enter cybersleep for the remainder of the month, as the atmosphere of your planet and human behavior in general is tiring my brain.
Pedialyte, drink it before you start drinking. It will lessen the dehydration that occurs when you pee a lot from drinking. I also drink it the next morning to reduce the hangover since it re-hydrates you.
Mine is a prevention rather than a cure, but before I go to bed when I’m drunk I always try to have at least one piece of dry toast and drink a big glass of water. Sometimes I’ll take some preemptive Advil if I’ve really been hitting the sauce
Drink some water throughout the evening - at very least have some water before you turn in. In the morning, get yourself something starchy & greasy, like some breakfast tacos.
"There was a guy (shaughnessy bishop I think) that wrote a book on it and this is what he came up with:

“He did eventually stumble upon a cure, or what he suspects is a cure. The recipe includes milk thistle (for your liver), N-acetylcysteine (for your immune system), vitamins B1, B6 and B12 (for your metabolism) and frankincense (an anti-inflammatory). Consume that concoction at night, before you stumble to bed, and Bishop-Stall promises that the next morning you'll “still be tired, even exhausted, but otherwise things tend to be right as rain.”

I have not tried it but have read about others that have and swear by it. I just generally drink some water and take a couple of Advil and generally I’m ok"
Drinking an alka seltzer before bed or immediately after waking up. Tbf it really doesn't help with the sluggishness that now seems to last a couple of days. Late twenties, 4 beers, y'all.. thats all it takes
The night before I have a couple CBD gummies for about 1000mg dose. Has been a complete game changer for me. In the morning I'm a little slow but not incapacitated like I have been in the past. The morning after I'll have a carbonated water and greasy breakfast. Before the gummies I would always have trouble keeping food/water down the next day. No longer an issue for me.
Hangovers are due to being dehydrated… as others said, drink lots of water before bed, and preferably drink water as you are drinking alcohol as well and you'll be fine. Drink a glass of water between each drink, or after every 2 drinks… and then another glass or two before bed and you'll likely not get a hangover ever again.
Drink a shit tonne of water so you throw up. You will normally feel a little better after throwing up.
Gatorade can be helpful, but if that doesn't work just eat a bit of salt and have a nice glass of cold water. Greasy food is often described as a great hangover recipe, but it's the salt you need and a heavy meal while hungover could lead to a bad time. Eating salt and drinking water is much easier on the stomach in my experience, then have a nice full meal later when your stomach can handle it. Also I like eating granulated salt.
Not sure if it's been mentioned here or not, but surprisingly a few puffs of pure oxygen really helped to clear my head when I was still drinking.  Might be hard to find, but that's the best single thing I've done the day after to dull a hangover.
A tall glass of water with electrolytes. It rehydrates your body while you sleep and works like a fucking charm. I've had lots to drink and woken up the next day perfectly fine.
Honey on toast plus a pint of water before bed, the water rehydrates and the fructose helps in the morning
Advil, apples and the largest possible fountain coke.  I have no explanation as to why, but it's worked for years for me.
"No greasy food at the end of the nightwhen your drunk ( stops the belly and the sick feeling).

Glass of water when you get in.

8 hours sleep

Wake up, scrub you teeth until you no longer taste alcohol and then drink water until you cannot physically drink anymore. So 1 maybe 2 pints in one hit. Have breakfast, avoid bread/ anything that will bloat you. Walk the dog/ light exercise outdoors within 2 hours of being awake. Get home and within 3 hours of being awake you should be right as rain."
About  4 big glasses of water and 2 pain tablets before bed. Then the next morning - more water, glass of cream soda, any McDonald's of any kind. Works like a charm.
"Pickles with each drink the night before, and the day after pickles, pickle juice, or sauerkraut. 

Goes super well with vodka, and it's a snack with your drink. 

The sodium prevents alcohol from excessively dehydrating you, so it also helps to drink some water as well."
Before bed, drink some pedialyte and water. When you wake up, waffles with a fried egg and some salsa on top with some bacon on the side. Even if you're not drunk its a kickass breakfast
"Old bartender trick to help gutrot specifically: pour bitters (brand doesn't matter) on a lemon wedge and then bite and suck the juices in. Won't help with headache, but will with gut rot.

Other tricks:
- take vitamin B before you pass out and when you wake up.
- eat lots of food the night of drinking. This will make you fat, but will lessen the hangover.
- Pedialyte (or other hydrating salts)
- chain smoking cigarettes will make any hangover 10x worse. Try vaping or chewing tobacco instead. 

Lastly, if you can muster the strength, go workout. Get a nice long run, swim, or bike ride in. Shit helps. Or do an ice bath."
The only thing that gets rid of my hangover the next day is stuffing. Just Stove Top...nothing fancy. It is seriously the only thing I can keep down while feeling like that and makes my stomach feel so much better. I assume the bread and everything soaks up some of the stomach acid.
had a terrible hangover at 16, could’ve been the fact that i drank way too much and combined it with edibles. it was my first “hangover” and i threw up 4 times the next day
"Before you go to bed you should drink something with a lot of processed sugar like preferably non carbonated alongside an advil. Also make sure u have sprite at home, that's the first thing u want to grab in the morning.

I've been using this technique since i was 14 years old (20 now) and it works everytime 90% of the time.  
For those wondering i'm from Belgium where the legal drinking age is 16."
Andrews liver salts. Old school but it works. Been around for ever for a reason. Not too much though.
Coconut water, pedialite, pickle juice, gatorade or other sports drink all work amazing and will quicly replenish electrolytes. Drink water before you go to sleep and don't eat right before you go to bed.
Lots and lots of water... coming from someone who was once an moderate alcoholic the best cure for a hangover was drink plenty of water before bed then drink a bottle of luczade an hour after waking up as your body will need that energy and sugar.
"Greasy food, Excedrin extra strength, lots of water, electrolites, hot shower/relaxing bath, comfy nap.  

I have a trick though to AVOID hangovers. For every drink, drink some water or mix your vodka or tequila with Pedialyte.. Or dont drink any alcohol with sugar because sugar is what gives you hangovers not to mention being overly dehydrated."
"i'm a hardcore alcoholic and was hungover the vast majority of mornings over the last 12 years (got it down to once a month now!) but my go-to was:

1. chug water wtih an advil or excedrin (not supposed to combine tylenol with alcohol but i did it plenty as well)
2. smoke weed
3. eat a burger

that should fix just about everything. repeat as necessary.

also, though it's not necessarily healthy behavior either, the biggest difference maker i've found is just throwing up. stick a toothbrush in the back of your throat and get it over with. before you go to bed, if possible."
Water before bed, water when you wake, a Lucozade or drink which replenishes electrolytes and a v busy hospitality shift....
I heard this on a local radio station some years ago but it seems Fresh Strawberries is a possible hangover cure, the antioxidants in strawberries help, when to have the strawberries, before or after I am not sure, but if your eating strawberries before a hangover, you might as well drink plenty of water to help with dehydration anyway, also drinking water before you go to bed if possible also will obviously help.
"Know your limit, drink a lot of water an hour before bed, maybe have some chips

When you wake up, have some greasy food"
McDonald’s hashbrowns, a fatass-sized jug of Gatorade, and running a few miles has never let me down. I’ve found that no matter what I eat, it doesn’t really go away unless I exercise it away.
Vitamins or prenatal pills. We found this out the day after my husband's 30th birthday. He was super hungover and I always took vitamins when I was in his position. The only vitamins we had were my leftover prenatal pills. He took them and drank a lot of water. Within an hour he was right as rain. We keep them on hand just for hangovers.
B12 before you start drinking or before you go to bed. Lots of water. In the morning fresh ceviche. Works every time.
Bruschetta.  I've gotten plenty of looks for saying it, but it will completely cure my hangovers after a few pieces.
Strawberry coolatta from dunkin with like 3 orders of hashbrowns followed by smoking a lil weed and taking a nap.
"Before drinking: Take 2 aspirin (NOT Tylenol!) along with plenty of water.

While drinking:

1. Match every drink with a glass of water.
2. Have some salty/greasy pub foods.
3. Know when to stop drinking.

After drinking, if you end up with a hangover anyway:

1. Drink lots and lots (I mean it) of water
2. Excedrin
3. Boil some water (a mug in the microwave for 2 min will do) and breathe the steam. Do for at least 20 min. Reheat the water as needed.
4. Ramen noodle soup. Any flavor will do but I'm partial to beef. For best results, drop in an egg while boiling the noodles, and add a squirt of siracha sauce before eating.
5. Hot shower can help too."
I don’t mean this in a judging way at all, but drink less. As I’ve aged, I just savor what I can drink.
"Everyone is saying drink a bunch of water right before bed or right after you wake up. Nah, I drink water as I drink alcohol. Through trail and error I've found *at least* 50 ounces of water throughout the night. If I can double or triple that, better the odds.

I also agree with the taking a nap. Wake up at four am with a killer hangover, drink water, go back to sleep. By the time seven or eight comes along I'm good to go.

For aftercare, even if I'm feeling fine. In the morning I always take a vitamin, drink a powerade and eat a full breakfast."
A sausage and egg McMuffin meal from McDonalds is always my go to and a nice hot bath and a cup of tea to top it off
Don't drink. Then you can't get a hangover. There's also the other way, never stop drinking, but when you eventually do imagine the hangover
Some of them are incurable, but you can at least prevent seizures and stress by slamming another beer.
there's a drink in lithuania called 'Vytautas' and it's a sparkling mineral water that's basically fizzy salt. It's am immediate cure, plus if you drink a lot of it quick enough it'll induce projectile vomiting from all the carbonation.
"Does no one else save their pickle juice for such occasions? That's helped me a lot in the past.

Additionally, you can buy Pedialyte at the dollar tree. Stock up on that stuff."
"I'm 37 years old and I have never once had a hangover, using one super easy technique...

&#x200B;

I don't drink."
I always try to stop drinking an hour or 2 before I go to sleep and drink 3-4 pints of water. But if I’m too drunk sometimes I will chug 2-3 pints of water then immediately go to sleep and pee myself
"You’ll probably not believe it but if you’re hammered drink 1/2 liters of Coke and eat some chocolate before getting to sleep. I have no clue why but works unbelievably for me. Did it by mistake and then tried it a few time afterwards. It works. 
I drink rarely but when I do I get absolutely plastered and I begin functioning normally after about 2 days. I drink only on Friday so I can recover until Monday. But with the combo I mentioned I am up and running by Saturday afternoon."
Glass of water before bed and 2-3 pedialyte pops in the morning. Works WONDERS. Also cutting out as much soda and sugar as possible during drinking helps a lot too
I run on the elliptical for 30 minutes. Sweat everything out and once it’s over my headache is completely gone. Motivating myself to get ON the elliptical is the hardest part
As I got older I tolerated hangovers less so I drank less. No longer do I want to ruin half my weekend feeling like shit and regretting what I did the other half.
I'm 31 and I stopped drinking last year, but I used to take a pregame prilosec before I start drinking. It usually keeps the nausea at bay the next day. Also, the next day I would drink a lot of water, a fruit smoothie and take a multivitamin.
"Double egg bagel sandwhich, black coffee, cigarette, a quick nap, and a very long very hot shower.

I also keep drinking an abnormal amount of water throughout the day"
"Sudafed, Nasal spray (the good allergy stuff) to clear sinuses, ibuprofen, coffee , hot shower, Caffeine and menthol infused shampoo, eat peppermints constantly all day.... a tin of peppermint Altoid mints is the best. 
In this order.

This of of course after you fucked up and didn’t drink water before bed.... that’s more of a preventative."
"This was weird but my last hangover was the easiest to get rid off.  When I got home I knew I would be feeling it in the morning so I drank a couple of glasses of water and ate some pretzels.  When I woke up I found out I had to go to a pool party in mid 90s heat in an hour.  Sweated that hangover out in shade and felt better in no time.
So prepare before you sleep and sweat it out"
As a Mexican, to my fellow Redditors....I’d say Pozole or Menudo, with a Michelada or Mineral Water (preferably Topochico) with some Lime!
"38 here. Water before bed (not too much, just to get ahead of the game) then 1ltr bottle of lucozade and a choc-ice for breakfast.

Works almost every time."
Water, Sugar, Electrolytes. These can all be acquired with a couple bottles of Gatorade. There are probably some lesser available solutions out there that might do a better job. I've heard Liquid IV works really well.
"Getting out of bed and getting Fresh air is an important part of the equation.

Sometime the walk to get coffee helps more than the coffee."
"Can’t get hungover if you don’t stop drinking...
Likewise, can’t get hungover if you don’t start drinking."
"In no particular order and each with varying degrees of effectiveness

1. Menudo/Birria with a glass bottle Coke from Mexico
2. Coconut water before sleep and after sleep
3. Michelada/Bloody Mary/Maria
4. Aguachiles, bonus points for the juice in the beer
5. Dramamine, Ibuprofen and drown in a bottle of water
6. Sleep on my side so I don't snore and irritate my throat
7. Throw up
8. Hash browns and pancakes
9. Alka Seltzer and Club Soda"
Find a way to incorporate non alcoholic liquids into your drinking rhythm. Eat food. If you wake up feeling groggy, drink rockstar recovery.
"I usually forget to drink water for bed and then I hate myself in the morning.

Coffee, 2 paracetamol, water, a fatty breakfast with tea, a bit of laying around and last but not least, I don't drink sodas but a Coca Cola after breakfast is just brilliant for some reason."
Dill pickle juice: A shot before bed and a shot in the morning. Water. And grease, cheeseburgers come in handy here.
"The best answer I ever saw:

“Minimum a 100-mg edible, two bong rips, a fatty breakfast, a bloody mary with lots of hot sauce and black pepper, five cigarettes, an Adderall if you have one. If not, coffee, sex, sleep, sex and football.” 

Courtesy of [Rooster magazine](https://therooster.com/blog/few-great-hangover-cures-your-fellow-drunks) and I tend to agree"
Legit just wake up, take some sleep medicine like ZzzQuil, as sleep is the only thing that works for me. Also drinking pedialite before drinking and before bed can help.
Probably not an option for most hangovers, but saunas, steam rooms, hot/ cold pools definitely work. If you go on a big night out in Budapest I highly recommend going to the thermal pools after.
"I PROMISE this will work. 

Before drinking: fill up a large water bottle or glass with water and mix in a generous ammonia of Himalayan pink salt (any salt will do really). Chug/drink that as quick as possible. 

After drinking: drink 2-3 glasses of water before bed."
"A lot of people have already mentioned various version of the same but for me it's:  
B Complex Vitamin (I take one everyday anyway).  
Water and/or electrolytes and plenty of it.  
Protein and carbs - Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich FTW.  
You can have a shot or whatever to delay the bad while the good above take effect.  Just no pain killers!"
When you get home go to the garden with several gallon jugs of water, drink a painful amount until you can drink no more (getting sick is a bonus), go to sleep, wake up with no hangover.
Japanese digestive pills work magic, but I think any digestive pill will work tbh, in addition to lots of water and nutritious food
Glass of water before sleep of course, but a very cold light beer in the morning works everytime, I sounds bad, but does not taste bad
"Stop drinking before you eat dinner. Dinner can be at 2 am, you just have to go from alcohol to food to water with 2 Tylenol liquid gels and a nexium to bed.

Wake up feeling good every damn time."
"I am 44 and only have had 3 hangovers in my life.  If I got them every time I drank I would not drink at all.  I don't understand how people still drink knowing that they are going to be hurting for 1-3 days afterwards.

On the 3 hangovers I got, I drank  2 liters of water and a 32oz gatorade and felt better in a couple hours."
Drink water before going to bed. Get up and drink more water, pop a few tylenol and ibuprofen, go get brunch (eggs benny and a caesar or three)
"Cure after .... nothing but time and water

&#x200B;

Prevent the night before -

* Finger down the throat, puke out the excess booze in my stomach
* Big ol' bottle of water, I recommend a CORE 44oz.
* \~1 hour before bed pop some charcoal pills"
"I used to get the worst, most debilitating hangovers. Then I found a pill called ""Chaser"" at drug stores like Walgreens that was amazing. I had hardly any affect afterward. Then they stopped making it :("
For me, it’s a large greasy breakfast of eggs, bacon, hash browns and coffee. I had a hangover yesterday, but slept in too late to make breakfast; I woke up around 12pm or something like that. Anyways, I ended up with a steak finger basket from Dairy Queen, but it still didn’t hit the spot, and I finally felt better about eight hours later after some chicken soft tacos, mustard potato salad and a personal pizza.
My hangover cure is prevention.  Not to say that I don’t drink, or even get drunk, but I have found that sticking to the same liquor and/or beer that I know well helps me manage my tolerance and intake.  Mixers with sugar are generally no good and running through a gamut of different types of shots with a group of friends is generally a recipe for an unwanted hangover.
Water! I can’t stress this enough. Keep your body well hydrated before going out drinking. Even after the night is over, chug some water. You won’t feel a thing the next day.
Cardio. Its hard to initiate, but getting your blood flowing and your body sweating helps work through it. Marathon sex is my preferred activity.
"Smoked Salmon on toast before going to bed! 
Literally the only thing I’ve had that works every time.
Eating it for breakfast also works."
I've been reading through the comments and what a bunch of whimps! Have a shower then have another drink.
"AA. Haven't had a hangover in 16 months and I've lost 60lbs! 

I understand that most people only get hangovers rarely as they seldom overindulge, but if you're getting hangovers regularly, it might be time to stop drinking."
"Dihydromyricetin (DHM), or Japanese raisin tree extract. It works. It’s the only thing I’ve ever found to work - and as a sufferer of awful hangovers, I’ve done a lot of research and been willing to use myself as a guinea pig for a lot of suggestions. Most are nonsense but DHM is the closest I’ve come to a solution. 

Some people say it prevents them from getting a hangover entirely, for me I’d say it reduces symptoms by 50-75% (it varies). 

You still have to hydrate properly - it can’t fix dehydration, obviously. If I’ve understood the science correctly, it temporarily increases the metabolic rate of the liver so speeds up the processing of the toxins from alcohol.

It’s been a big help for me and has meant being able to function in the office after a night of client entertainment, or going out with friends on a Friday night and still be able to do fun things with my partner on the Saturday.

You can find them on Amazon or google the active ingredient in your country and see if it’s sold anywhere. It’s a bit pricey but well worth the cost in my opinion - and in any event costs less than a beer usually.

Hope this helps someone out there!"
I turned 30 in December. Until about 26 i could drink until 12 and go to bed and feel fine by 7 when I had to be at work. Those days are long gone and I feel like death most of the day. I haven't been to a bar in 4 years i just have a couple on my porch with my wife in the evening and all is well. As for hangovers definitely drink a good amount of water before going to sleep.
32 oz of blue powerade.  Drink the first 30% at a comfortable pace.  Fill that part back up with water.  Wait 30 minutes to make sure you don't toss it up.  400mg of ibuprofen.  Drink the remainder of the bottle over the next hour.
two milk thistle pills and a big glass of water right before i go to bed to clear my liver out while i sleep. generally i only have a small headache and hangxiety the next morning, which i fix with some aleve, diet coke, and a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese.
Vitamin C and your B’s.  Water, sunlight, rest.  Large bready (think subway) meal.  Xanax, Valium, Ativan whichever you’re poison.  I like to finish that off with a huge Bloody Mary.  Then straight to bed.
"28 here and my friend SWEARS by this regime:

Drink a cup of coffee, take a shower, and then drink as much water as possible until you fall asleep. 

This is all done in the same night as when you're drinking. Personally have not tried this method. The last thing I want to do when I'm drunk is make coffee and take a shower. I'm more of a come home, eat snacks, and pass out type of girl."
After I've had too much Whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, pan-fried in salted butter.  I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks, and go to sleep.
The old finnish way is to pour a glass half way with water, the  other half with vodka. Drink the glass half way and keep adding vodka until the hangover is gone.
N-Acetyl-Cystine and Vitamin C, at least 500mg of each. Take them out with you and pop one of each for every couple drinks you have. This and I cannot stress this enough- HYDRATION.
Pickle juice, black coffee and something farmers will know about calf life save two spoons in the coffee
I figured this out by accident—-I was having a tough time with IPA’s, so after much experimenting, I realized I had become allergic to hops. So, because I have seasonal allergies, I drank water and took an Allegra right before bed. BOOM no hangover or soul crushing sinus headache/pain the next day. Turns out the histamines in beer and other alcohol were killing me. Antihistamines before bed....hangover gone!
500mL of water before bed or staying awake enough time to get half sober. If u have a sprite drink it as your morning coffee
"The two most common and most ""debunked"" answers are still correct. 
Before bed and then again in the morning:
1. Drink plenty of water
2. Eat tons of fat and carbs.

It also helps to make sure you have resupplied your vitamins with plenty of fruits and veggies before you start drinking.

It is also definitely true that sticking with one kind of drink helps a ton. Also, if you do change it up, don't drink a harder alcohol after a softer one. 

Another that may just be me.... You may be able to tell when you've had enough, so, When you're done your done, pour out the rest of your drink or save it for tomorrow."
"When I was younger I had a foolproof hangover cure: wake up, drink lots of water, eat stuffed shells from a nearby pizza place (basically the trashiest, cheesiest, greasiest Italian food you can find), drink even more water because that shit is salty as fuck, and once you've digested all that pasta, go for a run. When I got out of the shower after that run I felt *great*. Not like ""I have finally recovered from a hangover"" great, but like I had been reborn. Better than I was before. In my 30s, though, this no longer works. The only cure is water and sleep, and if I don't drink tons of water or Pedialite or whatever before I go to bed, the next day is pretty much a lost cause no matter what I do. Pedialite and similar drinks DO work though, but you generally have to drink one before you start drinking and then one before you go to bed. Prevention is much more important than ""cures"" at this age."
As a heavy drinker in college, 1 keep a gallon of water by your bed, when your about to pass out, chug as much water as you can then sleep. 2, anything greasy and easy to eat helps a ton, 3 personally i eat pickles, good on the stomach and gets salt in ya.
Drink top shelf purified vodka and ginger beer. The vodka doesn’t have the same amount of congeners or impurities as brown liquor, and the ginger beer settles a queasy stomach the next day.
Dive into cold ass water. I used to wake up hungover and after diving off the dock into the freezing Pacific ocean that hangover was dead.
Prevention. Drink a whole glass of water in between every alcoholic beverage you have.. extra points if you have one glass of water with elecrolytes before going to sleep.
"PEDIALYTE! 

Its literally a CURE for hangovers dude.
The reason is because when you drink, you become dehydrated, loose electrolytes etc.
Pedialyte gives you all that shit back right away."
"Any kind of soup with a red chile base (my dad swears by menudo), lots of water, and of course rest. Wild poleo tea is also a traditional hangover ""cure"" where I come from but I'm not sure how easy it is to find."
Chug a bottle of water before sleep. Chug another one when I wake up for my night piss. Get in a good workout and greasy breakfast in my system in the morning.
For god’s sake chug a Gatorade and take a multivitamin and a b complex before you sleep, and then go have either beef congee or pho  in the morning.
"I follow simple rules.

Situation 1

1. Never drink on an empty stomach. have a good meal 3 4 hours before starting.

2. If empty stomach, order some food while drinking.

3. Don't mix drinks. Stick to 1 poison.

4. Drink a glass of water after every 2 drinks.

5. Try to avoid smoking.

6. Have limited drinks. Don't drink till you pass out. Have 1 drink less than what you can handle. 

7. Don't drink cheap alcohol.

8. Have atleast 7-8 hrs sleep.



Situation 2

If I follow the above rules I won't have a hangover in the first place. Even if I have one I have rules for that :

1. Have some carbs rich food within 30mins of waking up. (generally i eat idly, something common in India, or some white rice would do), a light carbs rich breakfast

2. Drink lots of water.

3. Take a bath.

4. Sleep for 2-3 hrs



Situation 3

If after hangover,  acid reflux sets in.. Oh god.
I switch to only liquid diet for the day.
Drink lots of fluids. Take a few antacids.
Eat some curd and rice.
And sleep..

Aaand i wished I never had alcohol in the first place. 


I have only been to 3 once.
Mostly the steps I follow don't end up in hangover.


_Precautions ALWAYS are better than the cure._"
Stay hydrated.  Take ibuprofen when you get up for that 4 am piss.  Bite the ibuprofen in half before swallowing it.  Make sure to have eaten dinner and get something for breakfast.
"Hammering a ton of water before you go to bed is the real cure. You have to stop it before it happens.

Everybody underestimated the water but if you drink like 4 glasses before going to bed you’ll be totally fine."
"“Never been Hungover. After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, pan-fried in salted butter. I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks and go to sleep.”

\-Ron Swanson"
Usually just take a phat rip of the water bong or bowl and I'm all set, maybe toss a nap in there too
"The cheapest noodle soup from the local grocery store will get my body running again.
Also lots of water before and after sleeping"
"is this a serious question?

if it isn't drink more and never sleep/pass out, you'll continuously delay the hangover the same way you continuously pay off credit card debts with other credit cards.

btw this is a joke, don't drink more and don't pay off your credit card debts with other credit cards.

serious answer: water and sleep."
A greasy as fuck burger from a dodgy kebab shop, then pound a couple of pints of water whilst eating it and before going to bed. Keep a glass by the bed as well.
"Try and preempt it with at least a pint of water before bed. 

Failing that, Irn Bru. For me it’s always better to have let the fizz go out it a wee bit first."
A large glass of water and ibuprofen before bed.  Then eating something greasy as soon as you are able in the AM.  I recommend biscuits and gravy of a bacon cheeseburger.
I always try to eat something high protein before I go to sleep and when I wake up I make 4 pieces of the greasiest bacon or sausage and 2 eggs with a English muffin
Coconut water and food the day after but the best way to prevent one is to drink plenty of water and maybe take a couple Advil before you go to sleep.
Bacon and egg sandwich. Two ibuprofen. Pedialyte. Giant glass of water. Brush teeth. Back to bed for another hour or two. This always gets me back up to 80-85% normal.
1.5 liters of water before you go to bed, and if you can drink another liter when you wake up in the middle of the night to take a piss you’ll be golden. Water is like 95% of it.
Pint of water per unit of drink the night before. If preventative measures not taken, a prairie oyster with a shit load of cayenne and burger King
"As a nurse I put Iv solution with medicine against nausea, gastritis and some paracetamol in. I've done so for a few friends and the relieve is almost instantaneous. 

I've never needed it."
Wake up in the morning (whenever that is), drink as much water as you can stomach. Take 2 painkillers (that don't kill you if mixed with alcohol for obvious reasons). Go back to sleep. Next time you wake up, drink more water (maybe a smaller glass or two), with rehydration salts/tablets. Back to sleep. 3rd/4th time waking up, get some food; preferably something lighter to get the stomach going and ready for more food. Maybe something like a cheese and ham sandwich. Back to bed and rest/sleep. Next time waking up, time for pizza/kebab/something fatty. Eat it. Love it. Become one with it. Don't forget water. Lots of water. After said food has been consumed, back to bed/couch/chair and rest, watch Netflix, anything but physical activity. If you feel like sleeping, sleep.
Was once throwing up all day long after a heavy night. Had one bite of a banana and it stopped instantly.
"Cold Pizza and Gatorade seems to always do the trick.

Also my local Gas Station has some greasy yet delicious breakfast burritos. One of those followed by the dump it induces and my system is usually flushed clean"
"It goes away the same way you get it.
Not sure if there is a proper english translation to that finnish saying."
8 oz of water for every shot, or beer you drink. Mix a few in while you're drinking, but make sure you drink a lot before going to bed. Also hydrate all day before drinking.
"Pretty sure these are the most common answers, but they work. Drink water before sleep. If you forgot, drink water when you wake up and sleep a bit more.

More water when you wake up. Don't wait till you feel hungry, but just eat something fresh and sugary like fruit followed by a fatty meal. Nothing beats kicking a hangover's ass with a bunch fruit and french fries.

Some people prefer forcing themselves to throw up. I prefer stuffing my face and mixing my stomach contents with some goodies to make it go down and out the right way."
"Depends, if you want to try prevent hangover, then a bunch of water before you go to sleep. 

For dealing with an active hangover, I always use tomato juice. Vitamin C, plus electrolytes. Helps a shit ton."
"This is how i do it for a long time now and i didnt have a hangover in a long time too. When i come home from night out, drink as mach water as u can, then some more. Change clothes and get ready for bed then take a piss. Lasts about full minute usually. Go to bed. Wake up, drink water again. Bathrom-  brush ur teeth, take a shower, take a massive shit( will be massive even if u dont feel it, trust me)
Back to the kitchen and get something light to eat, no meat at all, dairy and fruit mostly. Chill, mybe nap( i dont nap usually) and take a walk, or something that will make ur blood flow, better than lying and watching tv all day. Dont go to sleep too early either, it will mess up ur already broken sleep schedule even more."
Mines preventative. Every two drinks (a shot is a drink) take a full glass of water as your next drink.
When you get home and before you go to sleep have a small bite to eat, a glass of water/Gatorade, multivitamin and a pain reliever (I prefer Aleve.) wake up feeling pretty good
"sprite

one time a friend told me that one of the chemicals that it had created a wierd reaction when you're hangover or something like that... but it works!"
Large glass of water & stay up until sober. Plus probably some greasy food of some sort, either Krystals, Waffle House, something like that. Worse case scenario ramen noodles. Does the trick. The next morning-sleep in as long as necessary, upon waking—bacon and hash browns for breakfast with a pack of cigarettes and caffeine of some sort-coffee or soda. If ya must, you can go with a series of mimosas and get drunk again. No reason to wreck your life if it’s a weekend. The party must end eventually, however. So good luck with that, bud.
"Pho if I've already vomited, and mince meat on toast to make me puke. 

Then lying in bed just relaxing."
"Eucharist. 

Free wine? Check. Sunday morning? Check. Tics all the boxes, and as a bonus, redeems you from the sins of Saturday night."
Drink wine mixers made with a sport drink of some kind. I like vitamin water or body armor. I realize these aren't precisely healthy but I haven't had a hangover in a long time doing this.
"PMS medicine.  Pamprin, Mydol, etc. 

Years ago! I worked in a sheet metal shop - 40 guys, 2 women.  The first aid kit had one box of aspirin packs, one box of Tylenol packs, and 4 packs of generic PMS medicine.  I asked the foreman why there was so much of it, when there were so few women. He simply said, ""Hangovers. That shit's gold!""

Sure enough, a couple days later, I come to work with a raging hangover, so I gave it a shot.  Took 4 of the PMS pills, and 15 minutes later, I was good as new.

I've sworn by it ever since.  I know it sounds weird, but give it a try"

I drink a load of water before going to sleep. This invariably makes me wake up 3 or 4 hours later for a big piss when I drink another load of water with 2 or 3 soluble paracetamol. Another 3 hours sleep and I wake up relatively fine - then a decent breakfast and a couple of mugs of tea and all is fine with the world.
"Water, water, water! Drink lots of it in the days leading up, and a few glasses minimum the night of drinking.

Do you have to pee more often? Yes, but at least you can function the next day."
"A bit late to the party, but when I was a freshman in college I somehow started having a conversation with a homeless man who hung around proclaiming that the end of the world was coming and so forth.

In addition to telling me, in great detail, about how porn made the internet, he told me that if I ever had a hangover, to do a line of coke the next morning. I can't say I've ever tried it, but it was a very funny conversation."
Electrolyte tabs. Take 2 before you start and 2 the next morning. I worked for beach services and we kept them around for heat stroke. You always knew when there had been a party cause the packets would be scattered all over the picnic table. They worked great
"Alcoholic here! If hair of the dog is not an option 

- take your fucking vitamins

- keep yo ass hydrated. Coconut water and Gatorade can be used as mixers or chasers. 

- get sleep. Yeah it's fun staying up til 4am until you have to get up at 6:30. Aim for at least 6 hours. Benadryl  (diphenhydramine) is a trustworthy sleep aid. 

- try eating 1,000-1,600 calories of actual people-food a day. Preferably healthy shit. 

- exercise and junk"
"WAAAAAATER

Before you start drinking
While you are drinking
After you've stopped drinking

WAAAATER

P.S. if in the morning you have nausea and general not well being, a singular runny egg (leave the red runny) does wonders"
"Drink 1-2 glasses of water. Pop a multi-vitamin. 
And for extra points, eat something with carbs before bed (toast, leftover pizza, whatever)."
A lot of water before bed, 8 hours sleep, explosive diarrhea upon wake up, a bloody mary,  eating comfort food, sleep again.
down a bottle of poweade before bed, refill that bottle with water and drunk throughout the night....coffee and ibuprofen the next morning
For every 2 mixed drink you drink 1 glass of water before bed, 1 glass of water for every 5th pint of beer/similar, 1 glass of water per 2 shots...if for whatever reason you forget or it doesn't work, have a black tea in the morning that is high on caffeine with honey to taste, my preference is twinnings Irish breakfast tea. Continue making and drinking said black tea throughout the day even when you can no longer feel the hangover...
I remember a friend of mine saying that at this age (early 30's) its not the booze I'm hung over from but the late night fast food that I get while drunk.
"Drink a huge glass of water, and (trust me on this one) eat some biscuits before you sleep. Digestives work great, if not graham crackers or some kinda equivalent would work to. I have no idea why this works, but maybe the carbs help to absorb the alcohol? 

If you’re looking for comfort food the morning after, have some hotpot. Best hangover food ever."
I see a lot of people saying water before bed, or after if you forget. I found Gatoraid is even better.
I'll drink my whole bottle (32oz) of water and have a protein shake, bonus if it's casein, right before bed. Then wake up, more water, then I'll go for pho or ramen.
"Lemmy from Motörhead was once asked if he gets hangovers. He responded, ""To get hangovers you have to stop drinking.”"
When you wake up in the morning have another shot or two. If you keep drinking there's no hangover lol.
A liter of water before going to sleep.  In the morning, an explosive shit followed by a hot shower, then giant omelet with a ton of cheese and all the meats, then playing video games on my couch in a bathrobe for several hours.  Usually sets me straight.
I need to have at least 2 - 3 full water bottles before I eventually clock out for the night. If I don’t drink any water before I fall asleep then I’m fucked and will wish I was dead the next morning.
"Watch [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/PassionfruitPaws).

Cuteness is a guaranteed hangover cure"
"I have this dialed: NAC prior to drinking, 2 pints of water before bed, NAC the next morning, a multivitamin, and maybe a dash of CBD if it's bad.

NAC is a precursor to glutathione, the compound your liver uses to detox."
Do you know that feeling you get when you drank so much the night before that you can't imaging having a drink today? Ya I don't get that anymore.…... But I digress,.... Pedialyte before you go to sleep is best but in the morning will work also.
"Does preemptive count? Do not drink your alcohol with sugar mixers.

Put a glass of water next to you when you go to sleep. If it is still there in the morning drink it all down. Drink another glass of water. Then eat food TWICE. After that you should be good. 


If none of that works, bite the dog."
"a banana, and a gatorade and the hottest shower I can manage

&#x200B;

if i know im shitfaced and need to be proactive, ill make myself puke the night of, and drink a gatorade before sleep"
I drink water before bed, sleep off any spins I have (if I wake up spinning I sleep more) eat sonic, have some pickle juice and more water and I usually feel just fine
"I cut out pop a few years ago, made a huge difference. Mix my rum with club soda or bubly. 
Then if all else fails, Hair of the dog."
Drink 3 liters of water each day. I drank almost an entire bottle of grey goose and felt fine the next day, still drunk. I puked of course. But I've only thrown up a total of 3 times from drinking too much. This third time I was hydrated. Biggest difference in the world.
Toast - with crispy streaky bacon, then baked beans lightly spread on top - then cheese on top of that, grilled.
"Pound water, a small glass for each drink if you can.

If you're still hungover the next morning: Marijuana. Kills the nausea and headache, as well as negative mood effects."
Liquid IV. Chug a bottle of it before bed and when you wake up. Works every time. If all else fails, kush.
If I can remember, before I go to bed I take some sublingual B vitamins, absolutely crush a glass or two of water, and put ibuprofen and another glass by the bed. In the morning, if I have a headache, I'll take the ibuprofen and go back to sleep for a bit. If not: Heavily buttered toast, soft-scrambled eggs and a mug of hot, salty broth (I keep like every flavor of Better Than Bouillon in my fridge). I swear it.
"Pedialyte.

Lacking that, Tang, Alka Seltzer, a red bull, topped with soda water in a large water bottle."
Drink as much or more water than you do alcohol, and pace yourself. Also try to stick to clear, mid to high end alcohol, less additives the better. Used to drink José Cuervo as a teenager because an ex liked it, worst hangovers of my life.
Drink enough water while you drink and before you go to bed. Obviously everyone's sensitivities are different but it's the best option to prevent a hangover to begin with.
Milk Thystele tablets... one a day + a shit ton of water before bed when drinking.. Works every time!
"Emergen-C (I think that's the name ) will revive you and eliminate the ""wet brain"" symptoms after a hangover. 

Trust me, as I blacked out and thought the high alcohol content had done some brain damage but the EmergenC saved me"
My Fiance makes the BEST hangover soup! It totally works! It's dried napa cabbage, root vegetables, beef, and IDK what else in there to make a hearty broth that seems to cure me instantly. DHM tablets or drinks are second.
"Alright man...the big secret...IS...

A glass of *salt*water before bed, chased with a glass of regular water. This is a triathelete trick my brother taught me. The salt will cause your body to retain the water - especially useful after drinking alcohol (anti-diuretic, causes water to not get absorbed by the body but just pass through). 

Then, first time you wake up in the AM (I always wake up early), chug 2 glasses of water then go back to sleep. You'll wake up right as rain. If still feeling crummy, have a glass of coconut water. That stuff is god's gift to drinkers."
Throw a lemon lime Gatorade in the freezer the night before, electrolyte slushie the morning of the hangover reaaaally hits the spot
"Drink anything carbonated. It’ll help you burp and get those gasses out.

This can also backfire though and you might not trust a burp."
I eat mcdoubles or junior chickens. Then drink a lot of water before bed. However, I don't get blacked out drunk. YMMV.
"Smoke some cannabis before you drink.

Now I can't say if it will work 100% for you but yea. Not sure how or why, smoke up, drink, smoke some more if you want, drink, vomit till you regret your life choices, sleep.

Hangover will never come"
Water and electrolytes before bed. Then in the morning, breakfast. Specifically, a huge, heavy omelette from a diner because I'm not making shit: Cheese, mushrooms, spinach, sausage, just all the things. Hashbrowns. Coffee.
"I tend to go for prevention rather than cure. Hydration is key. For me, usually one of every three drinks is a glass of water. A couple beers and a water. A couple shots and another water. And so on. Sometimes I'll down a sports drink right before bed (one of the low/zero sugar variants like Powerade Zero and Gatorade Zero) to replenish electrolytes, but I think the hydration is the most important thing, at least in my experience.

This leads to extra bathroom trips but you'll wake up feeling like a normal person, which is totally worth it."
"Fluids!!!! Being a nurse we mostly give patients ""banana bags"" which are called that because its yellow. BUT it has all the electrolytes your body needs to re-cooperate after a night of drinking. This is done through an IV. This is not possible at home, so after a hangover, drink lots of Pedialyte, Gatorade or Powerade. These have a lot of the same electrolytes that the ""banana bag"" has and will hydrate you."
I always drink whole bottle of isotonic drink and im good as new, if i dont i will be dying the whole day
8 0z of pickle juice straight from the jar before bed along with some Advil 2-3 glasses of water, and again in the morning.
"I have a guaranteed way to prevent hangovers 100% of the time.  

Do you wanna know what it is?  


>!DON'T FUCKING GET DRUNK!<"
"Here's my tip and recommended by people who know's what:

• Gin

• raw egg yolk

• hot sauce

• pepper

&#x200B;

10/10 would cure"
"Water, some pepto for stomach stuff, then..the hardest part. Its not easy, its easily the most painful stuff ever, but..

Excercise. You will feel like death. You will want to puke your guts out. But i find if you can sweat out your hangover, then get a shower followed by a 30 minute nap I'm right as rain. If i wake up at 7am, do all of the above i can be hangover free by noon.

But..most times its not worth the pain of that physical activity and i'll just take the loss and deal with the hangover all day."
How about drinking 500-600ml of water mixed with oral rehydration solution right after finishing the drinks? Anybody tried ? How'd it work for you ??
"Before going to bed:

-	Wait a an hour or two of no liquor to sober up 
-	Drink a Gatorade
-	Eat some protein and carbohydrate-rich food
-	Try to get 8 hours of sleep

After waking up: 

-	Drink another Gatorade
-	Eat something light (peanut butter crackers, wheat thins, fruit snacks)
-	Have the beer-shits
-	Take a nap
-	Eat a solid dinner
-	Good as new"
ive never had a hangover, but when i’ve had too much whiskey to drink i just eat a porterhouse steak and go to sleep with wet socks.
Youth. Wether that means being young and not having bad hangovers or drinking the blood of the young. Both work
Sorry.  Can't help you.  Been drinking since junior year of high school.  I'm now 44 and have never had a hangover.  Though I hear drinking lots of water before sleeping helps.
"Don't get excessively drunk in the first place. Poof, problem solved.

EDIT: getting downvoted by winos is highly amusing."
Eat lots when still drunk, drink pint of squash eat paracetamol, when you wake up for a piss eat paracetamol, when you wake in the morning eat a biscuit, eat paracetamol go back to sleep. Wake up midday drink sugary drink eat loads and loads of food the more vitamins the better. Get back on it.
"As a Scotsman who's had a hangover at least once a week for many years here's my advice:

1. Hangover cure's start on the night of drinking, if you can try your best to have a few glasses of water during the night, people advise having a glass of water after every drink but this is impractical, I usually aim for a glass every 3 drinks or so.
2. As tempting as it is do NOT order food on the way home from a night out, I know the spinning meat stick from the shite in a tray merchants looks like it will help but it absolutely doesn't. This rule is 10x as important if you suffer from IBS or have any stomach issues. Your body is going to have to digest all that greasy food in your sleep on top of processing all the drink you've consumed and will make the hangover all the worse the next morning.
3. Before you go to bed it's been said here multiple times but drink a few glasses of water to keep yourself hydrated through the night. Something I've done that helps as well (ONLY IF YOU CAN) is taking 2 paracetamols (500mg) and 2 ibuprofens (200mg) before going to bed, this combo always has me waking up better for it. An exemption to point number 2 is I usually eat a banana before I go to bed, you'll have likely pissed out most of your body's potassium reserves on your night out and there's theories this can be an attributing factor to a hangover. Might just be a placebo but i have noticed a difference since doing this.
4. Brush your teeth before going to sleep. Not sure if science will back me up here but sleeping with a mouth full of teeth that's endured beer and god knows what else from a night out can't be good for you. I make damn sure to brush my teeth before sleeping so my mouth doesn't feel like an ashtray when i wake up, this is particularly true for you smokers out there.
5. Try and get a decent 7-8 hours sleep if possible, if not try and have a nap at some point in the day, I've had entire hangovers wiped out by a short 1-2 hours nap in the middle of the day, sleep is magic. On the flip side my worst hangovers have always been from lack of sleep. Never ever ever stay awake while you're sobering up, i call this 'living through your hangover' and you experience the worst stages of your hangover that you'd usually be dealing with whilst asleep.
6. When you do wake up try and go about your day as normally as you can, get showered, get changed, brush your teeth, and make sure you keep your fluids up. Lounging in your bed laying in your own filth feeling sorry for yourself makes the hangover seem worse than it really is and can contribute a ton to overall feelings of anxiety.
7. Take over the counter painkillers throughout the day as needed if you can, preferably after food.
8. Try and eat light through the day, its so tempting to just have a massive order from a takeaway the next day but try and restrain yourself and have something light. Fruit is always a good choice here.
9. I'm seeing a lot of comments regarding hangover anxiety, we call that 'the fear' here in Scotland. This can be a fear of what you may have done / said the night before that you can't remember or just general anxiety you now feel as a result of now feeling terrible from your hangover. If you are feeling anxiety from your hangover you may have general anxiety lingering when your not drinking that reaches a head when you are in  hungover state. My only prescription here is to try and treat your anxiety before drinking and maybe take a few weeks off the drink if you have to. Meditation and learning ways to calm yourself down from panic attacks are great tools to help whenever you experience hangover anxiety. This isn't a quick fix though, it requires a good amount of consistency and work as part of your regular lifestyle.

In conclusion hangovers aren't entirely well understood, the baseline is that a hangover is your body experiencing alcohol withdrawal and the only true 'cure' is to drink more (see 'hair of the dog'). In my experience this actually...legitimately works...no seriously, but it only somewhat delays the process and many people can't stomach the sight of a drink the next day so this wouldn't be my recommended method. However drinks like bloody mary's (not to everyone's taste) are quite helpful in this regard, the hot sauce in it can be a real kick up the arse to get you going as well. That being said you may have an even larger hangover to contest with if you start drinking again the next day but if you're hardy enough it's a tried and tested method, albeit an incredibly unhealthy one."
Not drinking alcohol?  Drinking alcohol is stupid as fuck and people who need it to enjoy themselves are husks.
"At 42 years old for me drinking 2 or 3 large glasses of water before bed means i'm getting up to pee about 20 times until it's just time to wake up already. 

Also, I now get terrible anxiety the next day"
Improvement of your idea, after every alco drink get at least half pint of water, then add those large glasses at the end.
"It’s called “The Fear” here in Ireland and it’s AWFUL! 

I’ve often wondered if the headache and sick stomach are from the drink...or The Fear."
I don’t sleep great after tying one on, so when I wake up in the middle of the night I force down another big water and a couple Advil.  Wake up like a whole new person!
">2 or 3 large glasses of water before I go to sleep makes an incredible difference though, followed by 6-8 hours of sleep

As a man who has just turned 40, I'm impressed by that full night's sleep with a full bladder.  I've got to the point where I'm looking at that bedtime glass of water and thinking ""Is it really worth it""?"
If you can stomach it, I find a pint of semi-skimmed (don’t know the US equivalent) milk really does the trick. You retain more water drinking milk than water.
My father used to tell me “The best way to avoid a hangover is not to drink too much the night before. The second best way is to take two aspirin and drink a lot of water before you pass out.” It has never steered me wrong, though I’ve found I usually need to add a hearty breakfast and some kombucha the next day.
"it is relevant I answer to this. I heard that advice 20 years and followed...

&#x200B;

though I think my sleepwalking out of a window in 10m (30ft) high was part of having to pee really bad in my sleep. I was born onto a farm and first pee experiences were to go out on the meadow...seriously, this advice got me into the wheelchair :/"
"Hangovers are basically your brain getting dehydrated, so drinking water is a great tip.

I'd also recommend Gatorade or an electrolyte."
Take a B100 vitamin that contains thiamine before you drink. Probably should be taking it regularly anyways.
"For those curious:

Alcohol inhibits a hormone made by ytuitary gland called anti diuretic hormone (ADH). This acts in a similar way on your kidneys as a governor would on your car. Except instead of limiting speed it limits how much water your expelling. 

Drinking a bunch of water as the alcohols' effects on your ADH levels begin to wear down (like right before bed) can almost entirely prevent a hangover."
"I was getting stronger hangover after staying sober than after drinking dry whiskey.

Turned out I was just drinking way too much water - and the local water is pretty low in minerals so it was just flushing all electrolytes."
This works very well and actually taking 1 or 2 ibuprofen as well really helps and you'll almost have no hangover the next day!
The trick is to not only drink water at the end of the day but every time you drink alcohol. Like a stupid amount of water, 2-3 liters on top of the beer. Just drinking a few glasses of water before bed makes me wake up early and still fill like shit.
"Damn, I thought my plan was rather unique. Plan A is Water, Food, Shit, Shower, Jizz, not in any particular order. That will usually do it.

Plan B is smoke some weed and take a nap.

If you HAVE to, Plan C is drink some more alcohol and deal with it tomorrow."
"Alcohol is a diuretic, which means you've spent the night pissing out all of your essential vitamins and minerals. In addition to drinking water, you need to replenish your minerals, vitamins, essential fatty acids, and amino acids. You need calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and magnesium.

Theres no cure for a hangover. The only way to prevent a hangover is to pace your drinking to allow your body to properly break down the alcohol. You should also eat, and drink water or something with electrolytes while or after drinking. Try drinking a top chico or sparkling water with lime in between drinks. Mainly, don't drink too much. A fantastic night of drinking and fun with friends is useless if you regret it the next day. If you go to bed drunk without taking these steps, you're in for a world of hurt. Have fun."
"My friend once told me ""drunken shit has no place in sober body"". I remember her every time I go to take a shit, while hungover. Its been like 8 years ago 😀"
wake up, drink a glass of water, then nap again. Its weird. The first time you wake up, its a huge headache. Then the nap cures it.
gapyclatk is clearly a pro.  only thing I would add is for every booze beverage you have while partying drink a glass of water in between.
Drinking/having some soup is actually even better, it hydrates you more (because of minerals and whatnot).
"After living in New Orleans for 10 years, I've learned how to Mardi Gras properly so you can marathon party for several days straight. It's not a race, it's all day affairs so you aren't just getting super blasted the whole time. That said, the hangovers can be nasty so here's what I do after drinking and eating salty food all day for the 4th day straight:

I usually keep some pedialyte around the house.  I'll pour at least 2 glasses of half pedialyte half water and put it in the fridge to stay cold. Sometimes I'll prep this before leaving the house for the day, since you know I'll be drunk when I get home.

Right before going to bed, first thing I do is pound one of the glasses. The whole damn thing. When I wake up, I pound the second glass that is in the fridge, then take a nice long hot shower, drink more fluids and eat a nice greasy and carb filled breakfast. By the time you're at the parades and/or house party, you're ready to go."
"Did this a couple of years ago whilst being hammered. Pounded like half a gallon easy.
Woke up in like a half-drunk stupor basically hosing the bed in my own urine. Fell asleep in it."
I find that vitamin drinks like Berocca help more than pure water. Or maybe it’s just because I’m more likely to drink more of it. But I have one at the end of a night drinking before bed, another the next day and it seems to help.
To tack on to this, when you're guzzling down water before you sleep throw a vitamin B12 and advil in there and you're good for the next day.
Dim sum is my go-to food if I've been lax on my water intake (before you get another drink, have an entire glass of water EVERY TIME). Lots of greasy options that taste good enough that even hungover me wants to eat them.
Drinking a shit ton of water before the hangover is equally important. Had about 12 cups of water before I started drinking on Fourth of July. Woke up with no issues even though I had quite a bit to drink.
the worst is when you do all this and then your take your first bite and you think you're gonna be like MMMMMmmmmmm.....and then you're body is like NO! NO FOOD FOR YOU, and your stomach kinda does a somersault inside you.
As a reformed alcoholic I swear by two things when you can get something down- hot and sour soup or a McDouble with a small vanilla shake. One takes the sick taste out of your mouth, and hydrates you to a degree, the other supplies just enough grease and sugar to soothe the stomach.
"I fail at step 2. When my hangover is really bad, everything comes out. Every tiniest sip of water is thrown up at least 5 minutes after I drink.

And yes, I should stop drinking that much (different drinks)"
"Unfortunately, it looks like you have been permanently banned from participating in r/somerandomsubreddityoudontrememberpostingon. You may still browse and subscribe, but you may not post or comment. Reason: Rule 7.

BTW that subreddit lists only 6 rules. You're fucked."
Thats what i do if its really bad. Drink a shot ton right when i wake up, instantly throw it all up then have a glass of water and sleep for a little while. Vomiting helps alot
"I taught my teenaged sister. She instantly upgraded and started mixing pedialyte directly into her drinks.

Lifehax."
For sure. Whenever I've had a little too much to drink, I always chug a half bottle of the stuff before bed and the rest after I wake up with some water and it works wonders
"I used to work in a bar where we got this huge promo box of Pedialyte powder in those packs made for a single bottle of water, to give out to people. There was this huge list of stuff we weren't allowed to say, like ""hangover"" or ""overindulge"" or ""morning after.""

Anyway they were kinda gross like a salty melted popsicle but they worked a fuckin CHARM and honestly the bartenders wound up using most of them ourselves, get those if you can find 'em."
Every year we go to Vegas for an exhibition (well, not this year though) and the first stop from McCarren is a Target where we pick up SPF and Pedialyte. It works flawlessly, each and every time. Just one long drink glass full fixes so much.
I don't care what anyone says - the beer shit is what saves me. I can feel like complete ass all day but when i purge the pipes; instantly feel better.
"This actually works , I went out one night and for absolutely wrecked. The next morning I felt like crap , I go to the shop for a slushpuppy as that's my go to hangover cure , but it wasn't working. My friend suggested chucking a small bit of vodka in the slush, I was like ""hellll no"" but he insisted it will work. So I did and literally within a few minutes I felt 10x better"
"Drinking is just borrowing happiness from the next day, you can continue to borrow for quite a whil but eventually you have to pay up.

Luckily you can stave the hangover off long enough to start pounding the water and make it through in okay condition."
100% true. if you wait out the “straight up wasted” and get to “kinda buzzed” and drink a ton of water you’ll never get them but it isn’t very enjoyable to do it
lmao I do the exact same (unless I'm not that drunk so I don't get the spins when lying downto sleep). Stay up snd drink as much water as possible. It IS really hard though, because all the alcohol makes me sleepy and my eyelids get heavy n every fiber in my body wants to sleep already.
This is the only real answer. If you think 2 glasses of water sorts out a hangover, you only think that because you're 22. Your 2 glasses of water probably won't do shit when you're 30.
It shocks me how few of the comments involve drinking electrolytes. That's the primary issue. Water, electrolytes, and sugar will solve most of the problems causing a hangover.
Seems to me, if you've got enough sense left to plan ahead, you probably didn't drink enough to get a hangover.
"Also known as paracetamol for the kids in the back still posting about it. 

Really not worth it guys. If you absolutely have to get relief you can try ibuprofen if it helps. 
But I'd rather not even drink if I have to take paracetamol."
" Just throwing this out there, alcohol ~~and acetaminophen~~ is ~~a~~ terrible ~~combination~~ for your liver. 

FTFY

Let's be real."
Whats the deal with that?  I've found taking B-12 supplement and sometimes Potassium supplement helps with it.
"[You really shouldn't mix aspirin and alcohol](https://www.healthline.com/health/aspirin-alcohol#risks).

Mixing any pain killer and alcohol should be avoided."
I am in my 40's and 100% second this. This has been my go to for years. Although now I'm a vegetarian so I omit the sausage lol. Still works tho!
Aspirin really isn't recommended by anyone anymore. There really isn't an instance where paracetamol isn't better.
"All of those are worthless except the water and banana... to be honest the McDonald's is loaded with sodium and is working against you.

All a hangover is is a lack of water and potassium."
There have been times when I was so hungover I couldn’t even keep sips of water down. I smoked some weed and it was like an instant cure. No more nausea and I was able to drink and eat.
In college it was wake up, chug a glass of water, hit a gravity bong which induced puking if needed, now you take a shower and let that beautiful marijuana get you ready to find the closest Waffle House. You are going to need another gravity bong and a nap after Waffle House.
"I've never understood this. Any time I've tried it, even when I was in my early twenties, it only exacerbated the hangover symptoms. The headache would become sharper and I'd focus on it more. The cottonmouth certainly never helped the feeling of dehydration. Also, ""munchie"" food for me isn't the kind of food that's helpful for hangovers. Instead of a big greasy breakfast I'd usually want snacky food. If it works for you that's cool, though."
I can't believe how far I had to scroll down to find this. Unbelievable. There is no faster cure for a hangover than a bowl. Weed has saved me from a lot of sleepless nights and a lot of miserable days, both of which I suffer from when I drink.
Back in my smoking days, yes, i did this all the time too. Wake up hung over af, smoke a little, best case scenario: it helped with the headache, at worst it knocked me out so i went back to sleep for a long enough time to sleep off the hangover.
Wish this worked for me. When I would smoke after drinking it screwed me up big time and within an hour I'd be projectile vomiting everythere , head spinning. Cannot drink then smoke. I am a mess when I'm drunk but everyone knows not to get me near weed when I've been drinking because it is 100% worse.
"My one friend swears by this and that it is the only proper cure for a hangover. Last year on holiday in Portugal I got seriously shitfaced one night on some local moonshine and red wine. Fast forward to the next morning waking up with the worst hangover I've ever had. Struggled to get myself to the beach to go test this cold swim theory. I get in the water and it's freezing cold. Some old German man standing next to me laughs and tells me that we both go under on the count of 3. 

He starts counting down and as I went under water I vomited, but like a lot of vomit. As I came back up the man was standing there laughing at me swimming in a cloud of my own vomit. Asked me if it was a rough night. I just got out and went back to the place I was staying. I only fully recovered the next morning. Never again."
Came here to say this. But in my experience it doesn't have to be cold. I think your body absorbs water and rehydration happens faster than with drinking water. I just float around until I have to pee.
"Salt water is the trick and it helps if there are some waves to fight against. Tried the morning dip in fresh water pool and it didn't help as much but everytime I'm hungover near the beach and I have a morning dip the hangover is gone by the time I'm back to the room. Then it's water and scrambled eggs and pop a multi vitamin pill to replenish all the good stuff you lost from drinking. You won't be crisp and will probably need an afternoon nap but you'll be ready for a rematch with the bottle that night. 

And if I really want to avoid a hangover I'll drop a NAC pill just before I start drinking to boost my liver."
I spent years as an alcoholic and when I discovered Pedialyte it was like a new world of drinking had been opened to me.
"> wash two painkillers down with a bottle of beer

This can do damage to your stomach or liver, depending on which pain killer you take."
This is surprising close to my standard food/beverage/medicine combo except instead of poached egg on toast it’s over macaroni and cheese (not Kraft, that’s just disgusting).
"My version of this is the blue Naked Juice smoothie/juice bottles you can buy in gas stations. My pet theory is that it's it's the overabundance of B12 that takes it to a level beyond ""water with some kind of electrolytes""."
I agree! I have a hard time drinking water while hungover, so I always eat a bunch of cucumber, bell peppers, grapes etc. to hydrate.
Nope, fuck all that. During what was most likely the worst hangover of my life, I was working through a slow eight hour shift in a kitchen. Between running to the bathroom every 45 minutes to shit my brains out, I figured I should get some food in me. I had the same thought that cucumber would really help since it's cold and refreshing. Well, about ten minutes after eating an entire cucumber thinly sliced, I threw all of it back up. The skin was the worst feeling in the world coming back up because it felt like a bunch of wiggly little worms spewing out of my throat. Never again.
Forget the water/salty food/multi vitamin etc. Just take 3 painkillers its too late to do anything else.
We like to mix Blue Powerade with Sprite call it PowerSprite (original I know) goes down a little easier for me at the end of the night. Less bubbles.
There are a ton of ways to cure a hangover. Look at all the other posts of people saying that they do a thing and it cures the hangover.
Amen brother, i'm in the same boat. I'm 37 and i'm considering quitting for good this time. Been just over a month, feeling great, and trying to decide if I want to keep it going.
I haven’t drank since January & this thread is giving me serious cravings. Must just be the association with the fun of being hammered I guess.
"This is my strategy. Had a hangover last 2 full days where my only relief was for about 15 minutes after I ate.

I've not been drunk since."
That is mine too, get working on the hangover first thing. Eat a big breakfast, drink water or juice then go back to bed. Works like a charm.
"I’ve always believed that if you’ve played up- get up and show up. 

If you don’t need to go anywhere go have a shower, drink loads of water or lucozade and back to bed. Go throw up if you feel like it in the slightest, don’t lay there feeling nauseous all day."

">What I also do when I get really drunk, prior to sleeping I take one pill of ibuprofen.

This does damage to your stomach."
Yup, that's the real trick. Hydrate WHILE you're drinking, not after. For each alcoholic drink you have, drink some water. Then take two ibuprofen before falling asleep. If you still have a headache in the morning smoke some weed lol
You're being downvoted because you didn't answer the question. It's what's the best hangover cure, not prevention.
I got hangover anxiety even when I was 21. Sometimes it would be the only symptom I would have. But the anxiety can be really bad, to the point that I’m shaking
"Hangxiety is the worst.  At 35, I could go all night, and feel like a champ the next morning.  

Now, I was to crawl into a dark closet and hyperventilate into a paper bag for 12 hours."
Take a B100 vitamin that contains thiamine before you drink. Probably should be taking it regularly anyways
I’m the opposite. I’m usually really unmotivated and apathetic, but for some reason on days when I’m really hungover and feel like shit, I have a renewed sense of hope for the future.
I ma 39 and it's normally two days after I drink. I feel like crap the day after, but the second day I am on edge and can't sleep.
"The morning after a road trip stag in my 20's, I got in the back of a friends van for the 5 hour hungover drive back and started to have a claustrophobia attack. I had to sit in the front seat the whole way back. Never had an issue before but have claustrophobia now.

Last year I broke my ankle in three places and had a cast. I had to take Lorazepam to keep from freaking out from the confined feeling of the cast."
Yep, I had a hangover last week and actually woke up thinking “this must be coronavirus”. I was immobilized the entire day and couldn’t drink a sip of water without puking. Nope, just a hangover from having 3 very strong margaritas and not enough hydration.
"I think I'm an anomaly: when I was younger I would get crippling hangovers. Even just two beers would trigger a headache the next AM. 

Now, at 44, I can get shit rock hammered and, at worst, I wake up tired and very slightly nauseous."
For me it was after graduating college. Only a few months off and the first wedding I went to was rough the morning after.
That wasn't my experience. They disappeared after I was 30. I can currently drink about a fifth and at worst, feel sort of hollow headed the next day.
I hardly drink but when I was younger and out more often this is what I'd do amd it makes a huge difference.
Lol yeah I usually have to get up and take a leak after a few hours, but I try to keep one or both eye closed as much as possible and get straight back to sleep
I usually try and get a glass of milk in if I have been at the tequila, otherwise I wake up with heartburn.
"I'm not into things like Gatorade etc anymore,  I prefer to drink ""honeymansi"" which is the juice from Calamansi, a Philippines fruit, sort of like a lime, with honey, which is then heavily diluted with water. I drink that for the taste primarily as i find water doesn't get rid of the alcohol aftertaste very well. It certainly helps the hangover if I drink it **before** sleeping, but I have no idea if that's anything more than the fact that I'm hydrating."
Having a wank with a massive throbbing headache.. you really feel it up there. Sometimes it's so bad I forget that I'm wanking
"If necessary, it helps. Don't make too much of a habit of it though, it's nasty to the body. But it also gets rid of anything that may keep intoxicating you.

And hydrate after, with just water or something slightly salty (you know, ""sport drinks"" that help with hydration)."
"It's because lots of alcohol consumption disrupts REM cycle stuff so you aren't actually getting a full night's sleep; this is why you still feel tired and have a headache because you didn't *really* sleep. When you go for that nap your brain goes ""holy shit, here's our chance to fully rest"" and then immediately pushes you into REM so you wake up feeling refreshed"
I think part of it is the booze really annhilates your REM sleep, but during your nap you're actually closer to getting some kind of real sleep. It kinda works for me too.
This is what I usually forget to do. I’ll chug a lot of water before bed and kinda stay up for awhile so I don’t wake up needing to pee like crazy.
"Gin and soda, wedge of lime. No place won't have some cheap well gin and soda.

To clarify, in my area, soda = plain carbonated water.

I start with doubles, transition to singles as the night goes on, and then finish the night with just plain soda to keep my drink full."
Yeah. The shower goes on first so my parents don’t hear me throwing up. Water before throwing up to help the throwing up process. Shower to meditate n revive myself. Food to replenish my nutrients. Then texts last because before that, I’m too embarrassed to even look.
"The flavored ones are the bomb.  Only bad part is buying them, the cashier is always like ""Oh poor baby is sick?""  Yes lady the baby is in grave danger...as I'm sweating out pure whiskey."
Try losalt. It's potassium/sodium. Add something like mio and you've got yourself a great, cheap electrolyte drink with substantially more than something like gatorade/pedialyte.
Me too. I wonder why it's the shit though? I mean, water does help, but the shit even makes my blood pressure go back down.
"Only done it once, but my god is it effective.

I couldn’t get anything down for breakfast, puked before getting in the car to go to the wedding, fell asleep in the backseat on the way there, basically felt like death as I stumbled out when we arrived. My friend walks up to me and shoves some froofroo bellini bullshit into my hand and says “drink.” I try to tell her that I cannot even THINK about alcohol today. She gives me the icy you-will-obey stare. “DRINK.” 

30 minutes later I’m human again. 2 hours after that I’m playing sloshball/kickball in the rain with a full champagne bottle in hand. Great wedding."
A hangover is actually a short term alcohol withdrawal.  So naturally a little more alcohol does the trick for a time.
I end up doing this every time I'm drunk without fail. I can never sleep I just lay in bed sobering up until sunrise. Never had a hangover in my entire drinking career! (I'm 19 though, so might make a difference) I would love to just get wrecked and fall asleep.
When you are awake your body is more active and processes the alcohol better. Alcohol also inhibits REM sleep so the less you have of it in your system when you go to sleep, the better the quality of your REM sleep. Assuming you can sleep in for that extra two hours, your overall quality of sleep would be better.
I think it’s because it helps me sober up. If I’m that drunk and just crash right away I usually go to bed with the spins and wake up with them, but when I stay up I think a lot of the effects of the alcohol wear off.
"Yup, hangovers started getting way worse after 25, with new ""features"" getting added over time. Anxiety and nausea always the worst, never really got headaches though. My routine isn't foolproof, but it'll usually get me up to 80% and functional."
"Mixing paracetamol and alcohol (especially after a binge or if you drink a lot on the regular) isn't always a good idea. Usually won't be an issue for the occasional overindulgence, but be careful.

"> paracetamol

Are you fucking mad? That's TERRIBLE for your liver. This is among the worst internet advice I've ever read.

Also, Aspirin works better in every single situation for me."
"> All a hangover is is a lack of water and potassium.

No, water is probably the least contributing factor. Congeners are toxic biproducts of creating common alcoholic drinks. They aren't completely removed and literally poison you more than the ethanol does."
I think it was more about a component of Sprite that other sodas don't have, helps the liver metabolize the alcohol making you feel better sooner.
In college I used to get an extra large fountain drink cup and fill it to the brim with ice, half sprite, half sweet lemonade. Less bubbly and somehow the lemonade just worked. I called it my hangover elixir lol
I thought that was acetaminophen or Tylenol... my brother in law is a doctor and he assured me that that it was fine
"You can relieve symptoms or take preventive measures to make them less severe, I wouldn't call it a ""cure"" though.

Plus there's a point of no return where nothing will help besides time, primarily this depends on the amount you drink as well as how fast you drink it. At my worst I'd knock down the equivalent of 17-18 beers over the course of 3 hours on a week night. Let me be the first to tell you, no amount of Gatorade or water the night before or the following morning will make you feel better!"
I get you, I'm a recovering addict and I had a bad drinking problem. It's not worth it. Remember why you stopped drinking in the first place. It's still a good reason. It's not worth it to go back. Excessive drinking can and will destroy your life. Sobriety gets easier. The cravings will never fully go away, but you build tools that help you from going back. It takes hard work that'll be worth it at the end.
Both if possible. But crucial as soon as you wake up. I mean that shit better be in your hand when you wake up. Chug the entire container. If you can. Don’t like speed chug it. But I would say in under 2 minutes for sure. After that shower, and even if you got 3 hours of sleep or less, as soon as you put food in your system you will be able to do your job well without headache or aches or sweats. I would recommend two. One for the morning and one for they rest of the day. Throughout the day. You do all that you won’t even notice a hangover
Dudes grandma had passed away from emphysema recently and they still had her medical stuff kicking around the house. I wouldn’t have partaken if she were still alive; thats a bridge too far for me, hah.
"After 22 years of sobriety I feel pretty confident in recommending AA as a cure for hangovers. But, you're right, it only works if you work it.
I haven't had a hangover in 22 years. 
Best...cure...ever."
"I love it when people equate drunkenness with fun. Are you incapable of being fun while sober?

EDIT, sorry, missed the /s. My bad. But the reply without the s is something I've seenn and gawked at more times than I find comfortable."
I don't think either are very good to take when you've been drinking as both can cause stomach bleeding but ibuprofen is known to cause nausea and when you've been drinking you might not want to add to it
Drinking alcohol is for actual low IQ morons.  Imagine drinking poison just to feel elated for a few hours only to feel like you're dying for the next 24.  It's just bad decision-making all around.  I don't do other drugs either but at least some of those don't have that effect.  Even doing something as horrible as taking benzos recreationally still is less harmful than alcohol.
I get that hangover anxiety bad. I call it PDSD- Post Drinking Stress Disorder. This vague feeling that I’ve done something for which I need to apologize, despite knowing I did nothing wrong.
Wow, reading this made me feel so much more comfortable. I thought I was the only one and was having a mental disorder somehow strengthened by the hangover.
Oh my god seeing these comments make me feel so much better, I always wondered why I was such a neurotic mess after a big night. (Usually for no good reason, on top of my usual neurotic mess.) I ran to tell my husband about my new discovery - “Hangxiety” is now a term in my household! Thanks internet stranger!

Once I turned 25, it was never the same. But I was a notorious binge drinker in college so that probably made it worse. I don't drink anymore. The 3 day hangovers were just not worth it.
"You're lucky. I got my first hangover just before I turned 15. Went on a Mexico trip with my family and got obliterated with them one night. Took me 30 minutes to get to the burrito shop that was about 2 minutes away from my room. Took a ten minute break on a couch on route to take a nap. I've been getting them anytime I drink and don't hydrate enough now.

A bloody Mary helped me lots."
Yeah...once I hit my mid 20s it became a struggle. These days if I drink I'm basically out of commission the next day
But I’m 28 and I’m certain that I could out drink my 21 year old self and then go to work the next day. I’m also in the best shape of my life so maybe that has something to do with it.

Just drink Nyquil. I swig it straight from the bottle, 2 or 3 shots worth. You can also get just the active ingredient that makes you sleepy in OTC tablets like Unisom and Zzzquil if you think the NyQuil will make you throw up
"Smoothies help too!  
I usually just throw a banana, a quarter of an avocado, a fair amount of frozen blueberries, and enough milk to make it just above solid in a blender. It’s like a healthy blueberry milkshake, and I always feels significantly better after getting one of them in my system."
"I’m currently 25 and I always wake up hungover and SWEATY. Not like a workout sweat. Like a real oily gross sweat and I’m hot as fuck. No way in hell I can go back to sleep after that. Crawl to the shower, hit myself with the cold water to jolt awake and then let it get hot as hell itself to nuke the alcohol out of me. 

Next step is (hear me out) *pickle juice*. Not Gatorade or Pedialyte. A cold ass glass of pickle motherfuckin juice (and water of course). After that it’s basically whatever food sounds best to you. I like a bunch of grits and a 6 egg western omelette with as much Texas Pete as I can find. 

Proceed to shit my brains out. 

Bust a nut however I can. 

Profit."

Lol not in a college town, there’s even a new brand called electrolit marketed as a hangover cure, same exact product.
The way i look at it, a hangover is like your body having withdrawal from the alcohol leaving your system, only way for an immediate cure is to just add some more and give the body what it wants, a little dash of weed helps too.
then you spend the rest of the day drinking water so as you sober up you dont get the hangover, or you just have another day of drinking... how mine usually turns out.
This is part of it. Dehydration and metabolites from alcohol and tannins also play into it (the reason whiskey makes you feel worse than vodka in equal volumes).
Probably has a lot to do with it. Read up on what alcohol does to the brain, especially dopamine, and you'll get a better understanding of the vicious cycle of addiction. It gives you true pleasure in the beginning, but over time the dopamine is no longer released in the same levels, so you end up craving more and more just to get that euphoric feeling. Then after abstaining for a few days that feeling you get from that first drink isn't actually pleasure, it's relief from the withdrawals you're experiencing.
Oh god...laying down with the spins is akin to torture for me. There’s a weird blur between me knowing I’m okay and me thinking I’m going to vomit that I just hate.
I do this. Stay up as long as I can (usually drinking water) so I don’t have to get on the spinning train ride into oblivion. Definitely helps with the spins

"Well yeah of course don't mix alcohols and medication. I wouldn't recommend aspirin not paracetamol after drinking.

Drink less booze, Drink water (preferably soup) before going to bed, if you feel terrible in the morning THEN consider taking paracetamol.

To quote your article "" In general, if you are going to drink at a party or other social event  and you take a couple of doses of acetaminophen the next day for your  headache (again, no more than 4000 mg in a day), you should be fine. "" 

Thanks for pointing this out !"
"If you take 8000mg a day sure. If you take 500mg to 1000mg from time to time to treat the occasional headache then it's not. Theres a reason it's the most prescribed painkiller ( at least in western europe).

So no, it's not terrible advice."
well it's akin to being in a relationship with a totally psychotic woman that's fine as hell, is amazing in the sack, but treats you like shit on most days. You know deep down you need to move on, but damn the sex is good.
Ah it’s not that deep lol. I’m not an addict, the sobriety is just because I’m pregnant, so I’ll be back enjoying drinking again in a couple of months.
It's really bad yeah, here in Europe we have a warning on the box but it should be way more visible and widespread.

Getting drunk isn't good for your body anyway, but if you aren't doing it all the time you will probably be fine."
Lmaoo you got it wrong man. I was being sarcastic. I don't think I equate drunk being fun. I just hate people who have a complex of being better because they personally don't like alcohol.
Holy shit, me too. I just want to hide for 24 hours, even getting a message on my phone cranks up the anxiety several notches.
"When you get this do you also agonize over every thing you said, no matter how benign and think ""God I hate myself...""?"
It can be crippling, I  had it for years.  After running and lifting weights for awhile it has completely gone away, I don't even get hangovers anymore.  No clue why I just thought it was an interesting anecdote.
"It's fucking cute to see all these comments from college kids saying ""drink a couple glasses of water, bro! You'll be peachy!"" Do they really think we haven't heard of drinking water? Do they really thinking water is going to help when your hands are shaking and you're sweating bullets and you feel like the fucking walls are closing in? 

Water does **nothing** for the anxiety and low mood, which is by far the worst part of the hangover."
I went the hospital the first time I got at 21, I was so freaked out. Felt a little silly when i was told it was a panic attack because I thought I was dying. Now I just slow my breathing, even though I’m not noticeably hyperventilating and since I know it’s just in my head I can keep it at bay for the most part. Still not fun though.

"It's funny seeing all these younger people swearing by hydrating

There's nothing I can do anymore. If I drink I'm fucked. I used to not have any hangovers at all, then like a lightswitch when I turned 24 they suddenly started escalating slowly."
Well, I see everyone saying the hangover just gets worse after you get past your early twenties but I'm 29 now and definitely get milder hangovers than I used to. Then again I drink more nowadays.
">I’m 26 and I can have hangovers for 1.5 days now.

That is a bad sign for a 26 year old, I didn't get those till my late 30's."
"Same, bro. 

I could drink like a fish... entire 375 of vodka to myself? No problem. Get up and go to the gym the next morning as if nothing happened. Then I hit 30 and if I don’t basically follow each drink with a glass of water I’m screwed the next day. I’m 37 now and it only gets worse... I guess my hangover tip is don’t get hammertimed in the first place. 

The silver lining is a little less alcohol and a little more water isn’t a bad thing when it comes to your overall health."
"I'm not saying I didn't get hangovers before turning 25. I get them always if I drink enough. It's just that the threshold for ""drinking enough"" gets lower and lower and I feel really tired the next day. Noticed that at 25."
"Yeah in your case your better health may negate that general statement.  I've always been in excellent shape.  I remember I was around 23 years old when I woke up one morning after a night out and thought to myself ""Holy shit.  This is what a hangover feels like?  My head feels like it's on FIRE""

It's been progressively worse ever since.  The fact that I no longer drink as often as I used to definitely doesn't help.  In the hangover department, I mean."
Well yeah, but I'm female and bathrooms full of drunk women are some of the most supportive/amazing places on Earth.
You’re right, it is a type of withdrawal. I remember reading about it when I was going through real bad alcohol withdrawals

2 advil in the morning after drinking too much is fine. 

Abusing alcohol habitually AND taking more than the recommended dose of Advil is whats dangerous."
One of my best friends is pharmacist, I consulted her and she says it's completely ok  on that timeframe, but def medicine and alcohol is not recommended, but what can I do, I don't like hangover :)

At least you're not wrong about one thing."
Yeah I tend to get really nauseous when I drink a ton of water drunk or in the morning. I’ll wake up with a raging headache and usually I’ll smoke some weed for the nausea and my appetite and eat some soup. Also ibuprofen after and I can function.
32 and this is me. I can have a few drinks and be fine, but if I get drunk, my next day is pretty much ruined.
Yea I did drink water before and after sleep but for some reason this time the hangover remained. I guess it means I'm getting old. :(
Try to slowly get yourself to stop over indulging in alcohol. Your body is telling you the same, that's why even wine or beer could really fuck you up. The same thing started happening to me around the same age too, I didn't listen until it got to the point that I was having horrendous hangovers that was lastly 3+ days. Take care of your body , the liver and kidney are going through a lot already.
Booze quality has lots to do with it. Draft beer? If the bar has dirty taps you're going to feel it, drink bottled instead. Cheap whiskey...ouch. Drink something clean like better scotch or good vodka. Mine is Titos for that very reason.
preach. My tolerance has completely tanked. No more Car Bombs and Pickle-back shots. Now I feel like I get a hangover from just eating a brownie.
"For me it took stopping for a month to realize there was a huge mood component to hangovers that I didn't realize had become my new normal.

Now when I drink, even if I don't get a hangover, I'm so lazy and unmotivated and have horrible brainfog."
I’m a couple months shy of 27 if that matters. But yes I do drink way too much. I am a 100lb tiny woman and I try to keep up with my 300lb Canadian father. Although the next day I regret everything, in the moment I have fun lol.
I’ve been cultivating mass in quarantine but I’m still just pudgy. Give it a few more months. The beard is accurate.
It's a real hangover when you're afraid you might die; it's a real *bad* hangover when you're afraid you might not.

If you use paracetamol in the morning after the occasional binge, within the authorized doses, you're fine. If you're a chronic alcoholic then you have other issues to worry about, in terms of liver damage.

In other words : don't take 4g of paracetamol when youre shitfaced, wait till the next morning and maybe take 1g but preferably don't take anything.

And an early night!! It’s easier to have more & more AFDs these days. And I went over 12 months without a drink a year or so back.

I think you mean tolerance, and resetting it never works quite the same as it did the first time around.
Yeah this is absolutely how I am. I don't necessarily get the hangovers I used to like the headaches, stomach aches, nausea, but the next day I'll lay in bed until 2 pm, won't respond to any texts or calls, close all the blinds, and just stare at the ceiling basically unable to motivate myself to do anything more than go to the bathroom or put a frozen pizza in the oven. It's like 24 hours of a mega depression tidal wave.
Are drunken mens' bathrooms not as fun?  This makes me sad.  If we ever end up at a bar together I'll act as liason and can we can mobilize a crew of ladies to compliment your clothes/hair and otherwise be generally supportive... just outside the door or something.
My understanding was that they give diuretics to racehorses before they have to run to prevent them getting distracted while racing. Was this my dad’s bs?
Is that because the hangovers are so bad that weed can't help, or that weed loses its effectiveness for hangovers?
Your liver is telling you that's it done. Best pay attention cause it could go bad real quick if you keep going. Maybe go like 6 months sober and see what happens.
Man I thought that was just me.  I don't even have to necessarily drink to the point of being outright drunk to get that and that's exactly what it feels like....depression.  Once I make it to the next morning after that day I feel so great just because I feel normal again.  It must just beat the shit out of the serotonin in your brain or something.  Never used to get that but now I quit after 2 or 3 beers.
Hey thanks for your concern but I promise those hangovers are extreme and few and far between. It’s not a common experience. But yes I do need to cut back a lot. I’m still kinda trapped in my late teens/early twenties way of life and I will grow out of it.

Had to for medical reasons but I was glad to be told I could have a glass or two after a while. I did find some good non alcoholic ‘beer’ to get me through summer, it was hard & I’m glad I don’t now. Just need to keep more days not drinking than indulging.

"If you want to keep drinking just go for the [""Balmer Peak""](https://xkcd.com/323/) and stop after. It's that cool buzz everyone looks for that makes for a great night. 

You get the ""euphoria"" of drinking and you can start drinking water after so you won't have a hangover."
"That's what I figured it was. I definitely have a drinking problem and a lot of it is because drinking to excess is simply euphoric for me. I never feel as good as I do after 10+ drinks and my mind is firing on all cylinders. I guess now that I'm older, my brain isn't so good at making happy juices so after a night of that I basically have dead batteries. 

And if I HAVE to go out the next day I'm extremely pissy and short tempered."
Alcohol is a depressant. People need to realize that it's really toxic shit they're just indulging just for a bit of buzz. A shot of whiskey to calm your nerves is not bad if done in moderation. But drinking a lot of wine and beer, plus taking shot after shot is just punishing your liver.
"Yeah all those rules go out the window when enough alcohol is involved.  Especially, in my experience, at those ""if you can still smoke inside, here's the place"" kind of bars.

I once heard (and, naturally, joined in on) a conversation about Kegels between a 20-something lady and an older woman (maybe 40's) who was apparently a total stranger.  Everybody in the room tossed in their 2c.  I finished drying my hands, left for a while (long enough to have a whole 'nother beer) and came back to find 3+ totally different women continuing to discuss the benefits of, uh, regular exercise.

It really is a wonderfully supportive place.

Hahahaaa I used to work in a brewery. Nothing like a cold refreshing beer on a hot day! I’m a bit of a wine snob too. And love a good gin and a good crisp cider. And a nice American bourbon or scotch whiskey too.
"Here is a physiological explanation for why you get hung over. 

1. Dehydration. Obviously the major player, but don't forget the salt loss as well, even diluted down as it is (in physiology, this is called losing ""free water""). Hence the common tactic of drinking Gatorade in the morning. Unfortunately, Gatorade is designed to replenish after extensive sweat loss. Sweat is very salty, and your salt loss in exercise is much greater than after drinking. Can't hurt, but I like to water it down a little. 

2. Aldehyde toxicity. Alcohol is broken down into Aldehyde by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase. It is then broken down by aldehyde dehydrogenase into acetic acid (vinegar). Your body can only process a certain amount of alcohol/aldehyde per hour. Some hangover symptoms are caused by aldehyde. It's why you continue to feel miserable long after your fluids are replenished. Nothing can really be done about this, unfortunately. There's a new energy drink that purports to prevent hangovers, and its theoretical mechanism is by replenishing NADH, a substrate of these dehydrogenases (normally NADH is replenished by breaking down of proteins, which is why alcohol puts you in a catabolic state). Your standard B vitamin complex so often prescribed is also providing help to the enzymes. I think it's all bullshit. 

3. Gastric irritation. Alcohol irritates the stomach. 

It's better to prevent than to treat, but it's new year's day, and you didn't. There's a very simple treatment that I will be using very shortly on my own hangover that tackles all of these at the same time. 

**Hot chicken noodle soup.** Replenishes salt and fluids while the warmth settles your stomach. The noodles are easy to digest, and the protein in chicken chunks may help replenish the substrates that run the aldehyde dehydrogenase. I usually salt the soup a bit heavier, and eat with a piece of bread to help make the soup last longer in the stomach. 

Basically, eat the same thing that you will after a stomach flu. 

I may add that I am very hung over, and apologies for any factual mistakes. 

Edit: Thanks for the Gold. What do I do with it?"
"Finally, something I can contribute to!

A while back, my old chemistry teacher taught me a little trick he found out and I've always found it to work great! He told me that when you're about to go to bed when you're wasted, if you drink a glass of water that has a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper in it, it balances out the chemicals that are in your stomach in some fancy sciencey way, so when you wake up, you have nothing much more than a dry mouth.

I do it every time I remember to when I'm out drinking and I wouldn't say it's a perfect cure, but it certainly takes a massive edge off of it. I woke up this morning feeling a little dizzy and a craving for fizzy juice. Mr Stewart... I praise his wise words.

Apologies OP, if you're hungover right now and need something to help for now. I am useless in this case D:"
"Mine is a preventative measure.  I drink as much gatorade/powerade as I can the night before and take a couple aspirin.

If I wake up with one, same thing, gatorade and aspirin.  The trick is to stay hydrated."
Pedialyte. It's for babies with the shits, so it is intentionally made to rehydrate and has plenty of electrolytes. I would say drink before bed, but given that the question is about hangover cures, drink it in the morning with some Advil.
For me, a big bowl of Pho (Vietnamese soup), with copious amounts of chili oil. Make that sh!t like lava.

When I was in the military and worked on jets we would pop in and slap an oxygen mask on for a couple minutes. That stuff is amazing for a hangover.
I've posted this before, but it works like a charm.  Drink an alka-seltzer followed by a mixture of half Coke and half water.  The sugar and caffeine will give you a bit of energy and settle your stomach.  Nibble on some pretzels or saltines, taking things very slow.  Nap at will.
"In my time as a Medic, i would mix 1dl of IV-fuids (NatriumCholride), with 9dl of water, and drink it.

It didnt just prevent the hangover, but if i had one, it would ""cure"" it.

Why? Because the main reason that you are hungover is due to dehydration, and nothing hydrates better then water with abit of salt in it.





Edit: TL;DR: IV Fluids (NaCl) <3

(Side note: I know a nurse, who would usually hook himself up with IV-Access before going out, and when he comes home, he would plug him self up with IV fluids. He's a genious)"
"My fastest cure? You're dehydrated from alcohol so you want to take an Alkazelser and plenty of flavored Pedialyte (Pedialyte has more electrolytes than Gatorade which is what you need right now). An aspirin will help 'thin' your blood, so it helps with the headache but considering you still have alcohol running in you IDK that's what you want. Also have a large breakfast. If you drank so much your stomach is feeling wheezy, still eat plenty but avoid heavy foods like dark meats and opt for more greens.

Source: fraternity."
"Pedialyte. It's in every walgreens, cvs, rite aide, etc... 
It's medicine for babies when they keep throwing up. Each bottle has like 10 gatorades worth of electrolytes, and if you buy some and chug it all down quickly, you'll feel great in about an hour"
"You'll need a multivitamin. Take it right before you eat the following: any kind of pickle, drink some pickle juice, eat potato chips, make a nice greasy grilled cheese, and have some cream of chicken soup. You'll feel great. 

Just drink a shit ton of water the rest of the day to stay hydrated because that stuff is all sodium.

From a college biology professor - Orange juice with a bunch of sugar stirred in.  It seems to right the ship with me.
Coconut water before bed ( the larger sized container and drink it all - I buy it before I go out or when I buy liquor ) and a vitamin with chocolate (Ovaltine) milk in the morning. And even though I never want to, I go for a jog in the AM and follow up with water. I don't get hangovers following this regimine. 
To rebalance the electrolytes, I chug coconut water and throw in an electrolyte tab and aspirin for good measure.  A good bowl of pho to make life better (and for sustenance).

For intermediate hangovers greasy food and a Caesar (super spicy) delay the hangover for a bit. It usually comes back a few hours later though. 

Unfortunately for those really bad ones only sleep helps. "
firstly- If you smoke tobacco- give it up. The hangover immediately decreases by 50%. Then go to bed with a bottle of lucozade and guzzle whenever you rouse. 
Well since it's too late to prevent it and I'm assuming you haven't been awake very long here's what I do.  I get up AS SOON as I open my eyes in the morning.  get a big glass of water and down it.  take an aspirin with another glass of water and down both of them.  then you head back to bed and sleep for 2 hours.  Essentially the best way to get over a hangover is hydration and sleep.  You just have to sleep it off.

Before heading to bed, I set a full glass of ice cold water on my nightstand.  I then set my alarm clock for four hours later.  I then wake up when the alarm goes off, halfway through the night, and drink the water and go back to sleep.  When I wake up, no hangover.  Works every time.
Not even kidding...Take a five hour energy RIGHT when you start drinking, two will be even better. You can drink like a fish and wake up feeling great. The massive amount of B vitamins in those things does wonders for preventing a hangover!
If you smoke, quit.  When I would get smashed I would usually smoke a pack, to a pack and a half at the bar, and my hangovers would be horrible.  Once I quit smoking I found I could drink more and have less than half the hangover.

3) Going to the gym. (Again, I'm not a doctor. Only go if you're really feeling up to it.) If I still have a pesky headache or some nausea hanging around, I go 30 minutes on the cardio machine of my choice and they go away. I think it has something to do with boosting my circulation. "
lots of eggs and maybe some bacon, because bacon. then drink plenty of water and something with electrolytes, gatorade isn't ideal though.. I guess coconut water is best. although it tastes gross. you can mix it with OJ and it's better.
"Buried no doubt, but:

Compazine, activated charcoal, B-complex, Advil, ice cold Gatorade, spanish omelette, sleep."
"Stay hydrated, either drink a lot of water during the day up to when you are going to drink if you know about it in advance, or try to drink some before bed.

When you wake up have some more water and maybe go get some bacon."
"A good hearty breakfast, beacon not optional. 
Then a shower.
Now you need cannabis.
Followed by an asortement of snacks.
More cannabis.
A steak dinner.
And for dessert, more cannabis and a movie."
"Coconut Water. Drink one before you go start drinking then drink one before you go to bed.

More of a prevention than a cure but it's worked many times for me."
"Bacon sandwich - Brown sauce

Pint of milk

Have a wank

Do it in that order and boom, hangover gone and you've had a nice wank."
Gatorade and Powerade always works for me, it hydrates and replaces electrolytes lost. Wow I sound like an advert.
I find it very beneficial to take a massive dump, take a shower, and then make some breakfast food. It hasn't failed me yet 
Have a jump. I always bang my wife the a.m. after we've been out and drank plenty. Depending just how bad we are will dictate the pace, but we've always managed it. Helps no end, presume its just the endorphins or whatever are released after the act that help. Obviously a pint of cold water too.

Everyone here is talking about the physical effects of a hangover, but if you're like me and can easily drink 15+ standard drinks without those but suffer emotional effects (paranoia/anxiety) the plan of attack has to be different. For me either a little marijuana or preferably some benzodiazapines is the only way I can have a normal day after drinking the night before.
"Drink an icy-cold non-carbonated beverage of your choice in a hot shower.

Drink water. For the love of god, drink water. Don't drink it the next morning, drink it as you're drinking booze. A glass of water every hour - not necessarily even a big one! - and you'll not have a headache at all when you wake up. 
"Best hungover cure that worked every time is weed, greasy food, water.

"It's a lot harder to procure these days thanks to the meth head assholes, but back in the day, all we had to do was swallow a couple Mini-Thins (original formula… today I guess you'd have to get Sine-Aid/Sineoff, etc). And nurse yourself with a large soda or two. The side effects aren't great, but it killed some of the most massive hangovers I've ever endured (the ""drink a fifth of whiskey"" types). In under an hour. I could even work a full day doing hard labor, and still go out drinking the next night. Try it if you don't believe me. It works fucking great and I've tried a whole lot of remedies. The only other thing that helps is just getting drunk again (hair of the dog).

/oldguy"
Alka Seltzer when I first wake up. And as much water as I can stomach before going to sleep. Pho when I can. 
"Prep: carb load before you begin, and get some protein in there too.

While drinking: eat salty things, keep the carbs coming if you can.  This helps battle the dehydration from the beginning,and soaks up some of the booze.

Before bed: two bottles of water, two advil and one acid reducer.  

Sleep s late as you can.

In the morning, more fluids, and when your stomach is ready, milk, saltines, etc until you're ready foe something heavier.  Then go for a cheeseburger and a coke.  

This is whats always worked for me. "
Just drink 3 glasses of water before you go to sleep. If you wake up during the night, try to drink another one. Simple as that!

"This should be in LPT, and I should have posted it BEFORE NYE, but here you go. This is how you drink like a pro:

1. Think of your drinking arc. If you're starting at 10, and you want to be coherent at midnight, and then last until 3am ... plan accordingly. 

2. Every other drink should be a glass of water

3. When you get home, chug a big glass of water

4. Eat two aspirin before you fall asleep. 

5. Because you drank so much water, you will wake in the middle of the night to pee. This is a good thing. Drink another big glass of water while you're up.

6. Morning! More aspiring and a big glass of water.

7. Eat a huge greasy breakfast with carbs and protein and stuff.

8. Hair o' the dog? Have a bloody or a mimosa. 

9. Enjoy your day, bon vivant style"
I just smoke a bunch of weed before going to sleep, i never wake up with a hangover, drinking water between drinks helps too
A lot of good cures exist. Actor Robert Mitchum and Jim Morrison liked to drink a Ramos Fizz. In Ecuador they eat ceviche de camaron. But the best cure was  by comedian W. C Fields who would inhale oxygen.
"There's no trick. Hydrate w/ water (not soda or coffee) or sports drink. Pain reliever, caffeine (in addition to plain water), and Xanax. If you drink water before going to sleep, even better.

Yeah, not everyone has Xanax, but I find a low dose does wonders for a hangover. 
"
"Lots of hot/warm water before sleep.  Then about a half-cup (130ml) of pickle juice/brine.  

In the morning, Bacon, bread, eggs and a half-cup of Lima/butter beans.  "
Plenty of water and a big toasted bacon sandwich, maybe a couple of paracetamol. Worked for me today!
I crave milk. Some may find it a little nauseating, but for me there is nothing better. Drank two pints in one go after a particularly memorable night. Milk is awesome.
"Drink water before you sleep

Eats tonnes before you sleep

Wake up and be active, fresh air is good.

 Personally I don't eat too heavy on a hangover but pizza or any carby 
does the job."
Bacon and egg sandwich and more orange juice then you can handle. Alcoholic of 7 years and I swear by this.
"I did some research on a non-essential amino acid a few quarters ago, specifically L-cysteine. One of the contributing factors for a hangover, among dehydration and vitamin depletion, is thebyproduct of metabolism of ethanol (the chemical that makes you feel drunk) is acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is a ""probable or possible carcinogen"" ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde)). L-cysteine has been shown to react directly with acetaldehyde to neutralize its toxicity, but it also helps in the production of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde. 

If you take L-cysteine while drinking you will feel much better through the night. At the very least take it just prior to bed (make sure to rehydrate, too) and when you wake up. I have been unable to find L-cysteine in any grocery store in my area and have had to go to supplement stores or find it online. It's relatively cheap though."
"I remember hearing that rasher [bacon] sandwiches can help cure them.

The main thing is water, though. Alcohol makes you sweat / urinate so much."
"Never personally tried it, but I'm told if you have a friend with the access to supplies, an IV drip will make you feel right as rain in a matter of minutes. 

A more accessible option that usually works wonders for me is Gatorade Propel. And some 7up if you're pukey "
"- Drink responsibly
- Before bed, drink lots of water and have something salty and fatty (fast food)
- No hangover!"
Drink a lot of water, gatorade, or powerade before you drink. A large part of a hangover is due to lack of hydration because alcohol inhibits ADH (Antidiuretic hormone). Basically, this means that the hormone that usually inhibits you from peeing uncontrollably is turned off by the alcohol, therefore, you pee out much more fluid than is actually good for your body. If you are drinking a lot of fluids in addition to the alcohol, you can help decrease this effect and lessen, or completely avoid, a hangover.
Water the night before, while drinking or after drinking really helps. Eating after drinking helps. And never get drunk on an empty stomach- just asking for trouble. If your drinking hard liquor avoid drinking cheap stuff, they call it rot gut for a reason. Also, the A#1 hangover cure is yogurt,  I swear to goodness, y'all,  yogurt will fix your sour gut. Try it sometime. 
Fluids and rest will do wonders.  Drinking Gatorade will rehydrate you *and* restore some much needed electrolytes. 
So it's a full regiment but usually does the trick. Glass of milk, multi vitamin, vitamin B, a dose of your favorite NSAIDs, eggs, bacon, toast, and wash it all down with orange juice. That will cure any hangover. 
"I found [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soo4f6e1zCs&feature=player_embedded) a very helpful and informative video on the science behind it all.

Bananas are good; Potassium is your friend."
"Hangovers are often a manifestation of [potomania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomania), a form of [hyponatremia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia) common to beer drinkers.

To summarize, beer and other alcoholic fluids are commonly very low in electrolytes and solutes for their volume.  This results in an odd form of dehydration in which you have plenty of fluids but not enough solutes.  This condition is exacerbated, in my inexpert opinion, by the diuretic effects of alcohol.  When your body forms urine, some amount of electrolyte is drawn in along with waste water.

The treatment for this is to ingest two types of salts: potassium and sodium.  Sodium is found in common table salts, along with many processed foods.  Most things that taste salty will contain sodium.  Potassium salt is sold at most grocery stores, and I haven't done enough research to be able to list foods in which it is found.

To cure a hangover, therefore, you need water and electrolytes.  This is why Gatorade is a popular choice, and why most hangover foods are high in grease and salt."
Take a trip to pat's for a philly cheesesteak done the right way, extra wiz wit, cherri peppers, some hot sauce is soo good and for me theres nothin beter. Believe it or not i think i'll go get one now
"I find that if I stick to drinking quality alcohol that I can consume *far* more with much less pain the next day. I have a few guesses as to why this might be (more impurities in cheap booze for example) but I don't have a definite answer. I can drink most of a bottle of good Scotch and be fine. Pound back a bunch of cheap cocktails and I'm fucked.

Also, if staying hydrated during the time you are drinking (mix in a glass of water every now and then) is important. Add in another glass or two of water when you stop drinking or before you crash out. Being hydrated helps a *lot*.

Finally, I leave a glass of water and a couple of headache pills (generally ibuprofen for me) beside my bed. If I wake up feeling like shit I take the pills, drink the entire glass of water, and go back to sleep for another hour or so."
Water before bed. As much as you possibly can. Then more in the morning. I haven't had one since I started doing this.
Glass of water before going to bed (or when you have to wake and pee in the middle of the night), ibuprofen (800 mg) and Coke (plain old Classic variety) the morning after.
A bloody mary works well and is easy on the stomach. If you don't have that, use a beer, or shot of whatever you were drinking last night. They all work well.
"A bacon sandwich is scientifically proven to cure hangovers!

"Ibuprofen for headaches, least damaging to your body after drinking.
Pepto every 30 minutes, it i get sick I take some more 15 minutes later.
Gatorade, blue frost is best because it helps balance out the pH in your stomach. Orange and yellow are slightly acidic and may make the nausea worst.
A cold shower to wake myself up and get refreshed.
Pho is perfect hangover meal because of the light carbs and lots of broth is has.
A nap will do wonders after drinking fluids for hydration.

Pretreatment: chug Gatorade and eat a light snack before going to bed, wash up and get ready for bed, sleep is so much more restful when in your pjs

Pharmacy school and experience shows these work well for many people and me."
The best thing which me and all my friend use nowadays is a painkiller. Ibuprofen if you have it, dafalgan, or any of the others.
"Prevention: when you start slurring, stop drinking alcohol and start drinking water. Took me years to learn this but since then - zero hangovers.

Barring that: if you feel like throwing up, do so - you'll likely get a fair bit of alcohol out of your stomach that your liver won't have to deal with. Drink as much water as you can stand - 2 glasses plus - and take a couple of ibuprofen."
If you are near a Mexican restaurant, go get yourself or have someone bring you a big steaming bowl of menudo. Yeah, it's full of fat, proteins, and herbs, but this helps to alleviate the hangover blues.
My buddy works for this company, I thought it was rediculous until I tried it (I was always a couple glasses of water or Gatorade before bed kinda guy) but this stuff is legit, it's basically a vitamin drink that's formulated specifically to counter the symptoms of a hangover, comes in a can the size of a red bull, doesn't have any caffeine, it's not loaded with sugar, and it tastes mildly like fruit loops. Pretty awesome in my book.  Some bars are even beggining to make cocktails with this mixed in, you can purchase on their website as I believe it's only available in NYC, Miami, and a couple other cities right now. Aside from my friend, I have no affiliation with the company, but I had a chance to put the stuff to the test a couple months ago and was thoroughly impressed, worth checking out...   Drinkmercy.com
"[Blue Gatorade](http://menofkc.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Blue-Gatorade.jpg).

Never fails me."
Saline IV drip. If not available, alka seltzer followed by pounding Gatorade and a meal that is healthy.   
If you have prior planning, pepto, with ample water and 3 pedilytes. The night of chug a pedilytes, mid sleep chug 1 more, for breakfast you will need high protein food that won't be to heavy. Eggs are a good suggestion, as is dry toast, be it white or whole grain. Follow it up with some oh, and slam another pedialyte. Then take it easy, and if your feeling sassy pop a few Milk thistles. Be careful though they can interfere with some medications. Mainly the ones metabolized by the liver. Hope it helps. And good speed. 
I find chocolate milk helps and if you can eat eggs and beacon a fatty type of breakfast helps. If you can't eat then sleep and a shower.
For me [Underberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underberg) works wonders! It's not exactly healthy to cure a hangover by consuming alcohol but this stuff is more like a magical herbal potion.
"Im glad you asked Mcpatty317. This is my technique and it has not failed yet. First and foremost, I do not get ""black out drunk"". It is a waste of time and money. But for when you get home and you are quite tipsy, just enough to go to bed and pass out. What I like to do is, take a few ibuprofen, a vitamin and a tall glass of water. Voila! All better! It has not failed me and I have been doing this for a few years now. drinking only a night or two a month."
"Excedrine and smart water.

Worked amazingly especially when I had to wake up early to teach ballet to 3-4 year olds. 

Also want to say I didn't make it a habit of teaching hungover, but every now and then...it happened."
My friend once told me that whenever he came home drunk he would cook a porkchop, leave it there and eat it cold in the morning. I've never tried it but sounds solid doesn't it?
Dirnk LOTS of gatorade and water.  I drank two bottles of Sake once, and did this.  Granted, I had to piss like a deranged fire hose, but NO hangover, or dry mouth.
"Ok, Russian here. I don't think I can tell a lot about curing hangovers, but there's something I can tell what you can do to avoid them.

First of all, drink a shot or two an hour before you get to drink properly.
While drinking: 1) try not to mix drinks. Not a good idea. If you really have to, don't lower the alcohol percentage of your drink - go only ""higher"" with it. Basically beer first, vodka later. But never ever ever ever ever mix beer and wine; 2) Try to eat something that's not chips. Eat meat. Or pizza. Or some kind of salad with mayo; 3) If you are a smoker, you'll be getting drunk faster than non-smokers.
Before going to bed, drink as much water as possible - 1 liter would be enough. If your hangovers always come with a headache take 2 pills of aspirin or similar BEFORE you go to sleep, not in the morning. This tip made a lot of my awakenings painless.



And by the love of God don't put ice in your vodka.

"Drink lots of water before bed and take an aspirin, greatly reduces the chance on a hangover!

(Drinking water also helps to cure a hangover because it's basically you being dehydrated from the alcohol.)

**TLDR; Water**"
"Best preventive measure: Have a glass of water every few drinks at the bar or party. It adds up and makes a big difference and stops you from having to drink a gallon if it when you get home.

Best morning after measure for me: Strawberry smoothie. But I generally have to wait a little while before my stomach is ready."

"Hair of the dog is a scientifically proven remedy. The ethyl alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde as it is metabolized. Acetaldehyde breaks down into metabolites that are akin to formaldehyde, and thus toxic to the body. Drinking more ETOH causes it to compete for the same receptors as the acetaldehyde and thus lessens the symptoms of hangover.

2) heat up frying pan, cut bacon into sizeable chunks. Fry, remove from pan, leave the grease

"In my experience, a hangover in the morning means poor preparation. Hangover prevention is to be practiced during the entire period in which you are drinking. These are my rough guidelines, and when I followed them I could drink til I was cross-eyed and wake up feeling fine.

Drink twice to three times in water what you drink in liquor. (I'm not a beer guy.) Eat *something* before you go to bed and wash what you ate down with another glass of water. Space your drinking out over several hours. Shots are evil. Pour into a tumbler. On the rocks. No carbonated beverages; you get drunk too fast and it doesn't help with hydration. Make sure you have 12 hours set aside after drinking for sleep, if you're drinking before bed.

If I was feeling a bit poor when I woke up despite all this, a couple alka-seltzers and a few glasses of water would generally have me on my feet.

It was an awful lot of work, but then alcohol is a really rough drug and I was determined not to suffer for it."
"I've found a few things that work pretty well, but none of them are a ""100% Cure.""

* 1. Lots of water and aspirin before going to bed. If I do this, I usually won't wake up with a massive headache.
* 2. Drink a bottle of Gatorade. As many other redditors have said, it will replenish the electrolytes you've lost from drinking too much alcohol.
* 3. Greasy food. I used to work at a snack bar and if I had to work after a night of heavy drinking, I would make myself a big plate of french fries and chicken fingers. A college science professor backed up this theory.
* 4. Finally, and I don't know why, but I always find that taking a really long shower the next morning will help. I'll take a shower upwards of an hour. I have a shower/tub combo, so I'll sit down in the tub and just let the water pour down on me. I like to say, ""I'm rehydrating through osmosis"", which probably is not true (not a science person), but it sure as hell sounds good."
"You can't, just drink a lot of water. 

Weirdly enough, this is also how one prevents a hangover. At least for me. "
Drink water heavily before, during, and after drinking alcohol. Eat something substantial before drinking, snack lightly during drinking, and when you wake up eat some carbohydrates. Take some otc pain relievers when you wake up. 
"More alcohol, melatonin when you go to sleep, tylonel when you go to sleep, drinking equal parts water and alcohol, cigarettes... 

Oh, and for what's left over after that all?

Lots and lots of coffee and ganja. "
Half a glass of water mixed with half a pint of oj/cranberry juice and a pinch of salt. If you can bare it try and do some exercises too (sit ups and push ups) this gets the blood flowing and will aid in getting rid of the hangover.
"I discovered my anti-hangover remedy a while back!

I drink a bottle of G2 (Gatorade) and take 2 liquid advil. The G2 replenishes any salt and also re hydrates."
The best cure for a hangover is to wake up and smoke a bowl.  It's the best cure to a hangover you can find.
"I take B12 supplements before I drink, when i get home(along with a large glass of water(or more if I can)). I can honestly say I've never had more than a minor headache the next morning and i'm talking about nights where I drank so much I don't remember a thing. I'm also normally incredibly susceptible to terrible hangovers(puking until 12 with a monstrous headache)

**TL;DR take B12 before and after drinking along with a large glass of water or as much water as you can down.**"
The white can of Monster mixed with a powerade or gatorade... Drink half of the powerade fast so that you can dump the monster into it... It gives you a little boost and rehydrates you.  An aspirin with this is a good idea too!
Drink a load of water before you sleep. Go to the toilet before you do, don't piss yourself. When you wake up a fry-up is great. We're talking eggs (scrambled &/or fried), bacon, beans, sausages, tomatoes, toast, hash browns, mushrooms and maybe some black pudding. A mixture of all of that along with some more water or a juice of your choice is fantastic. If you can't do that, bacon sandwich.
"#1) invent a time machine

#2) go back in time and force yourself to drink one glass of water between every alcoholic drink

#3) profit!"
The absolute best way to prevent a hangover is to drink one glass of water or even soda between drinks or shots. You end up not drinking as much alcohol, and if you do drink a lot you'll have buffered your system. I keep a little bit of food on my stomach when I go out and in the morning I prop myself up with a cold bottle of water, a soda, Motrin and a nice pig meat based breakfast. The water helps with dehydration and headache, the Motrin for headache, and sipping the soda works well with a bit of sugar and caffeine which may or may not boost the Motrin. The breakfast is because I always crave bacon when I'm hungover.
i try to drink at least a bottle of water and take 1-2 tylenol extra strength depending on how much i drank. it's a miracle how well it works.

"Try ""Party smart""!! It's an Ayurvedic pill that you need to take before you start drinking and it works like a miracle. Next day, no hangover at all. "
I've found that if you chug a bottle of water before you go out and when you come home it is easier in the morning. 
I like to lay down in the bathtub with the shower going, and alternate between boiling hot and freezing cold water every minute or so. I feel like it really gets my circulation going, and is so uncomfortable that it quite often overrides the feeling of hangover-ness.
Not a cure, but prevention - take two Sudafed before bed. Seems to work for cutting the potential pain in the morning.
"Intense physical activity for about 1.5-3 hours. You're going to feel like dying during this time, but afterwards the hangover is gone and you can be ready to go about your day.

Either that, or start drinking again, but slowly."
If you drink a lot of water before you start drinking and while you're drinking, you won't have a hangover. 
Get one of those ten packs of tacos from taco bell. Eat about five of them then throw up. Eat the rest.
I've found that if I know I'm going out drinking and I take a multivitamin before hand, or in some cases just before I go to sleep if drinking happened kind of spontaneously, I will have a SIGNIFICANTLY reduced hangover in the morning. Someone said it has something to do with the B-vitamins or something. 
"My wife swears by Pizza.. If she's hung over in the morning and we get a slice of greasy pizza from the local pizza joint she feels somewhat better almost immediately, and mostly better after 30-60 minutes. Not sure the science behind it, but I'm guessing it's the salt/fat that helps in some way?

Personally I just hydrate myself well, and when possible make sure my head isn't spinning before sleep. I never have an issue with hangovers."
"Drink water.  Not when you are hungover, because at that point your life is already shit, but drink water while you consume alcohol.  For every two drinks, I have a full glass of water.  It keeps you from getting dehydrated at all.  When I get sloppy towards the end of the night, I drink 10 mouthfulls of water from the sink after I pee and wash my hands. 

Also, marijuana."
"The best thing is prevention:

Drink a whole bunch of water before you pass out for the night.

It always works for me. "
I take a vitamin B complex pill prior to going to sleep. I take several vitamins every morning, so when I wake up, if i still feel a little groggy, I'll take another one with the rest of my pills. The vitamin B12 in it really helps waking you up and get going. 
"As someone who gets hangovers very easily and has experienced the kind of pain that makes you want to put a barrel to your temple to end it, a few simple measures can be taken care of:

* Eating beforehand obviously. Carb it up if you plan to consume heavily.
* Drink water beforehand as well.
* Don't mix spirits. Meaning, don't take tequila shots all night and then suddenly crack open a bottle of red wine. As far as my experience goes, mixing all of these things is just a recipe for a nightmarish hangover.
* Take a break. Seriously, liquors take a tad longer to be absorbed in the system, so you're drinking heavy right now expecting an immediate effect. Everything you took in short succession is going to hit you like a truck in a moment.
* Eat throughout the night, it slows absorption.

Now for the post-party:

* *Lots* of water and some kind of OTC headache/migraine medicine (I have found the best results with Excedrin Migraine).
* Pedialyte is also an option. They are full of nutrients and will restore a lot of lost fluids. Not just for babies.

Remember, hangovers are not pain of the brain (because the brain has no sense of pain), it's mostly dehydration, so the brain shrinks just a bit and it tugs on the membrane that is the barrier between your brain and your skull. It's pulling on it and that is what is making it feel like a creature is trying to dig to freedom through your head."
"[According to science: eat a bacon sandwich!](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/5118283/Bacon-sandwich-really-does-cure-a-hangover.html)

>Elin Roberts, of Newcastle University's Centre for Life said: ""Food doesn't soak up the alcohol but it does increase your metabolism helping you deal with the after-effects of over indulgence. So food will often help you feel better.

>""Bread is high in carbohydrates and bacon is full of protein, which breaks down into amino acids. Your body needs these amino acids, so eating them will make you feel good.""

>Ms Roberts told The Mirror: ""Bingeing on alcohol depletes neurotransmitters too, but bacon contains a high level of aminos which tops these up, giving you a clearer head."""
"Nice shower, and then the following drinks, in any order and not together!

Chocolate milk, orange juice, energy drink, drink 1 of these each during the day and you'll be fine!"
Bacon will solve all your problems, my friend. http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/scientific-proof-that-a-bacon-sandwich-is-the-best-386742 
Soda or an equally sugary drink and getting up and starting your day, don't just sit around feeling sorry for yourself
Drink or eat something with alot of fructose at the end of a binge. A coke or a popsicle or something. It helps you metabolize alcohol faster, I usually wake up in the middle of the night with the spins and need to puke after a raging night. So the less drunk I am when I wake up the better off I feel. 
This might not work for everyone; drink a pint of water, eat a slice of good bread, go for a run, arrive home feeling like absolute shit, then power-hydrate and eat bacon & eggs. Within an hour, I usually feel pretty good. Booyah!
bloody mary, or if your trying to not go that route wake up an hour or two earlier than scheduled take 1 aleve and drink ramen broth.
"Hovenia dulcis (aka - Japanese raisin tree): If you have access, do it! A study conducted by the UCLA was submitted last winter (link?).

Otherwise, komboucha in the morning, especially a strong homebrew, can kill a hangover within 15 minutes. Just my experience."
Red beer, especially if it's bloody mary mix.  Today I had to settle with baileys and coffee which works too.
Eat bread 2 or 3 pieces before going to sleep followed by two tylenol or aleve and a bottle of water. The result is a hangover with no headache or nausea, you will still feel tired but is better than having a full on hangover.
Not for the worst kinds of hangovers, but the combination of drinking water, taking a shower, washing your teeth and using mouthwash is pretty efficient for the less critical hangover mornings. Sounds simple but works, especially the mouthwash was a 'eureka factor for me!
After 20 years of intensive study, I have found that the best thing for me is to actually get up that first time my eyes open. Get a large glass of water and pain killers of choice, go back to bed as long as possible. after getting up for the day, a Boston cream donut, or even better, Wild Bill's beef jerky. Shared with many younger than I and they have all thanked me for the advice.
"Swift Electrolyte tablets. They were at my old place of employment for workers that were dehydrated and cramping. I took a handful of them and too 2 before drinking and 2 after. Best summer of drinking ever.

http://www.moreprepared.com/moreinfo/swift-first-aid-electrolyte-tablets.html"
Aleve (aka Naproxen Sodium) with a multivitamin & as much water as you can down in less than a minute ( ~20 oz for me). While you let the water settle, make yourself bacon, toast & eggs. Eat this delicious meal while sipping another tall glass of water. After all of that, reward yourself with a brief nap. When you awake, you should feel almost 100% cured. 
"[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_VPXdGa2qM) is the best example I can find. 

I always used strawberries instead of black berries, and skim milk instead of soy, but you get the idea."
Coconut water for hydration, Aspirin/Tylenol for the headache, and a healthy breakfast. Works every time!
Sweat. Make yourself sweat. It's the beginning of moving that crap out. Hard to do  get yourself moving but it will help. Then have a beer, maybe just one though. 
"There is no 'trick'. Just don't overdo it, drink several pints of water before you go to bed and eat something in the morning.

If none of these options are available then take a shot of vodka with some egg whites and a little salt/pepper. It works."
"Hangovers are caused by dehydration.

I only tend to get them if I drink hard liquor. 

Before I go to bed, I drink a few glasses of water. When I wake up in the middle of the night to pee, I drink a few more.

Wake up, more water, get a shower. Then don't lay around feeling shitty all day. Get up and get out of the house."
Maybe I am just a glutton for pain but here is what I do. Drink a big jug of gatoraid and hit the gym to do some hard core cardio. The first 10 min you think why in the hell am I doing this? 20 min marker its not so bad but I am sweating like a hog. 30 min and up its all feeling better from here.
"2x PBJ sandwiches with banana slices inside.
1x V8
1x Shower
...and finally...
1x Gatorade with a multivitamin. 

I feel better than normal after this."
Prairie oyster my friend, works every time on the worst hangovers,  basically its a raw egg but your putting the other stuff in it to mask the taste
Before bed I chug a bottle and a half of water, then drink the other half when I wake up. Havent had a hangover yet! 
"A metric fuckton of water and something greasy/sugary to eat *before* going to sleep.

It's how I drank some 2 litres of wine and a bunch of tequila yesterday and don't even have a headache now."
Blue gatorade, as cold as physically possible, and a sleeve of saline crackers with slices of banana. 
Considering a hangover is an effect of alcohol caused dehydration of sorts.   Gatorade has worked pretty well for me in the few cases I drank more than usual 
"I eat a bacon sandwich (just mayo, bacon, and bread), and have a glass of alka-seltzer. Works without fail.  If you can't eat bacon, then substitute something with a lot of protein.

Also drink lots of water throughout the day."
I set my alarm for a few hours before I need to be up and put a glass of water and Advil next to the alarm, when it goes off I drink the water, take the Advil and go back to sleep until wake up time. Works like a charm. 
its a little thing called bacon buddies. 1) heat up a can of **vegan** baked beens. 2) cook bacon 3) toast white bread 4) put bacon and beans on to toast. 5) *optional:* top with ketchup. *serving quantity* a fucking dozen!
fatty foods, like mcdonalds, i usually eat before going to sleep and drink a liter of water, i didn't have a hangover in a long time...
"1. Don't sleep for too long. Keep the sleeping minimal and nap later if necessary.  
2. Drink powerade/gatorade or anything of the sort.  
3. Eat breakfast. I don't care how shitty you feel, eat fucking breakfast... and make sure it has lots of protein, sodium and starches. My go-to is bacon, hashbrowns and eggs.  
  
I did all of this today and I feel fantastic. Looking forward to napping though."
I eat a banana and drink a glass of water before bed.  Here's also a [link](http://www.health911.com/hangovers) with some other cures as well as the banana one.
"Aspirin will mess up your stomach, Tylenol will mess up your liver. Saw that happen to my Dad. Stick with coconut water, either pedialyte or gatorade and lots of H2o. I also take milk thistle. The theory is it helps detox your liver...maybe, maybe not. But it can't hurt.
"
Personally I've had the best luck with coconut water. I'll drink 12-16 ounces before going out. 12-16 ounces before bed, and then I'll keep one by the bed in case I wake up in the middle of the night.
"stop drinking an hour or so before bed
drink water before during and after
fresh berries in the morning (this works amazingly)
use mary jane if thats your sort of thing

no need for aspirin, Tylenol or what have you"
"Take at least 3 grams of Chlorella before you start drinking.

Take a capsule of milk thistle before you start drinking and when you wake up.

Eat some ginger or take a ginger capsule when you wake up.

Take a zinc capsule before passing out.

Bacon and eggs for breakfast.

That's more or less what I do. Works pretty damn well I must say."
"I asked my father this once.  ""What's the best cure for a hangover?"" ""Time.""  It sucks, but it's true!"
Water, toasted bread with a fried egg, but since your probably waking up in someone elses house eat whatever leftover pizza there is
Starbucks refreshers, the lime one. I don't know if they were seasonal or not but they are fucking amazing for hangovers
Controlling my alcohol consumption and not going overboard. Not sure why so many people find this so difficult.
"Okay, honestly this works, every time.

1) sober up some before you head to bed.
2) after sobering up a bit, take vitamins with b12, drink half a bottle of water.
3) take advil

Wake up in the morning feeling fine :D"
Cold shower. Like, freezing cold. Works perfectly on me, most I've ever had afterwards was a slight headache and hunger, which were both solved by really greasy pizza. 
"Vitamin b12, ibuprofen, weed if you feel like throwing up and a big ass extra cheese pizza (more b vitamins in cheese) and plenty of water. 

If I can remember, b12, water and ibuprofen before bed too. "
Booze is the cure. beer actually hydrates you faster than water however it dehydrates you in the long term. but when you start the morning with a drink you feel like you never stopped!
"oral rehydration salts and water.  They taste kind of awful, but we always had them in the Peace Corps as part of our med kits, and drinking that before bed works like a charm!
"
"If I can only remain vertical for about 10 minutes: 1/2 liter of water followed by: Bloody Mary with extra Tabasco, bacon sandwich, nap on the couch.

If I can remain vertical indefinitely, but just feel like shit: large glass of ice water at my local, followed by: Bloody Mary with extra Tabasco, large plate of bacon and eggs *or* biscuits & gravy and eggs.  Possibly followed by a beer, it depends on how the day is shaping up."
A glass of water and a good old fashioned sex session. I swear it works. Also, a cup of coffee and a joint helps me sometimes.
"Smoking a bowl, taking a shower, and eating a Bojangles Cajun Filet Biscuit with a gallon of sweet tea.


And water. Tons of it. "
Vitamin Water Revive.  It's the only thing that makes me feel better without eating food too.  For a mild hangover, I usually feel normal before I finish the bottle.  With a severe hangover, it usually gets me to  point where I can function albeit a bit slower.
"1. Dont drink.

2.If you plan on drinking anyway, buy a gatorade and 5hour energy, pour said 5hour energy into gatorade and drink. I find lemon flavor gatorade goes well with any flavor 5hour energy"
I find drinking a large amount of water before bed prevents the hangover from occurring in the first place. 
Assuming I wasn't smart enough to plan ahead and woke up with one, crawl into a hot shower and just soak until I feel like getting out. Afterwards I drink some coffee and either Gatorade or orange juice. I honestly have no idea why the shower works, but the coffee helps any remaining headache and some juice helps me get hydrated.
"Professional drinker here.

4- Advil 200mg

2 - Vitamin B-12 complex pills

1 - Glass of water with a packet of Emergen-C

1 - Slim Jim

1 - Bag of Funyuns

You're welcome."
"Easy.  

1. Grab a banana bag from the hospital for each person the night before. 
  
2. In the morning, place IV line, hang up bag, wide open to infuse over 1 hour.

3. Take 2 asprin, as much strong coffee as needed to wake up.

That's what we were taught in medical school, after the entire class showed up too hung over to work.  The prof postponed the lecture, gave us a crash course in hangover treatment."
Drink coconut water either before bed or in the morning! It helps you stay hydrated. Also, if you can hold it down, get something filling in your stomach. Saltines help ease a sick stomach!
"Headache Hangover: two big glasses of water and two excedrin. 

Vomiting Hangover: The same as above, only with a small glass of coca-cola and a few saltine crackers. Finish with 2 very small hits of marijuana, and you'll be golden in no time.  

Be sure to add sleep before and after both treatments. "
"I've always avoided a hangover by using these rules: first, I always eat an hour before I go out. Second, say I want to stop drinking by 2am. At 1am I stop drinking alcohol and then for the next hour chug down water like there's no tomorrow, so that I'm nice and hydrated. Another pint before I go to sleep and I leave one beside my bed in case I need it during the night or when I wake up.

When drunk me forgets to do that, I drag myself into the shower and brush my teeth so that I'm at least clean. Always helps. Then comfy clothes, and start on the water again until the headache goes away. Coke usually picks me up a bit, too."
"The trick is preventing it before it happens. In days when I was a lounger lad I used to swear by the purple Revive Vitamin Water. One of the main components of a hangover is a potassium deficiency of which purple vitamin water has plenty. 

http://www.vitaminwater.com/?product=revive#/revive 

TL;DR chug before bed, wake up with a clear head. You have to drink at least one WHOLE bottle. "
"Make friends with a paramedic or nurse. An IV will bring you around in minutes. Plain saline works fine but a banana bag is best. 

Then smoke a bowl and go eat some breakfast tacos. "
"alright... enough's enough, this shit is the ultimate hangover cure:

wake up, gargle with [dentyl ph](http://www.malegroomingreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Dentyl-PH-Mouthwash.jpg) or something similar, gets all the gunk out of your mouth/tongue so it doesn't feel like a moldy sewer hole.

bottle of gatorade, gotta replenish your fluids and electrolytes, motherfucker.

finally, eggs benedict and a banana milk shake. I've read that raw egg yolks have something in them that help metabolize alcohol, rumor even has it that [eggs benedict were originally developed as a hangover cure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggs_Benedict#Origin) 

**tl:dr** wizard mouthwash, saltwater, raw eggs, banana, one eye of newt later, you'll be right as rain"
For me, I pour half a glass of beer, and fill the rest with V8.  It's called a Red Beer, and it's a hangover destroyer.
Bit of an odd one, exercise! I always feel like shit but if I go pound some weights I feel a lot better!
"Dunno how this works scientifically, but it has always worked for me. Technically not a hangover 'cure', more like hangover prevention.

1.  When you get back from a night out, down two pints of water just before you go to sleep.
2.  You will wake up during the night to piss it out, after doing so down another two pints of water.
3.  Wake up without a hangover. Maybe have another glass of water for good measure."
That's cool. 300+ upvotes on this post but [my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15nege/in_light_of_new_years_whats_the_best_way_to_avoid/?sort=confidence) gets like... 4.
Drink water before you go to sleep. Always worked for me and always worked for people I told about it.
drink three tall glasses of water before you go to bed. it's sometimes hard to remember when you're stumbling into your house, drunk, but if you can remember you'll wake up fine every time (except for the pee trips)
"I read an article where some british scientists did a study and concluded the best hangover food is a bacon sandwich.

Also, in my experience, gatorade."
"Drink some real coconut water, while you make a very greasy egg+bacon+sausage+cheese sandwich. Let that sandwich sit while you take the hottest, longest shower you can tolerate. Bring a huge glass of ice water in the shower. Eat the sandwich with lots of hot sauce. Go back to bed. 

Always! works. If you can’t go back to bed, drink a pot of coffee and take an ibuprofen

Also, depending how wasted you are, try to eat something before bed and drink water before bed. It helps a lot with nausea in the morning."
Bacon Sandwich. Source: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/5118283/Bacon-sandwich-really-does-cure-a-hangover.html
Drink 1 glass of water for every 2 beers/shots you take. Hangover is caused by dehydration or I just have a Vitamin C Tablet with a huge glass of water at the end of the night.
Either drink just hard liquor or just beer bitch beer shit like that I've avoided doing that and not ended up hungover except the one time I did oh and smoke a bowl and drink some Gatorade mixed with water 
"A light Bloody Mary in the morning:

Beer Glass (pint glass)
1 1/2 shots of vodka
V8 Juice (fill glass half way)
3 splashes of worcestershire
Sprinkle of Italian seasoning( to taste)
Squeeze of lemon wedge

Stir it up or pour back and fourth between 2 glasses.
ADD ICE

After you feel the light buzz from the drink, bring 2 bottles of water to the shower room, down 1 of them.

Get into hot shower, when I mean hot I mean borderline uncomfortable, just stand under it for 3-5 minutes.  Rinse and clean body with cool\warm water.

When you get out the shower down another bottle of water. Turn the vent on to get hot air and steam  out the bathroom.

Get yourself a bite to eat.  Sandwiches work the best for me.(since I am from New Orleans Po-Boy's hit the spot nicely when hung over)"
"Weed.

But in all seriousness a physiology professor once told my class that drinking half gatorade/half water is the perfect osmolarity of your blood.  It rehydrates you while keeping in balance ionic concentrations"
"Can't cure it, but I have a pretty efficient way of preventing it.

Take one small ibuprofene and drink a liter of water before going to sleep. 60% of the time, it works every time."
Energy drink. Replaces the vitamins, has fizzy shit and sugar, caffeine gets most people up and running. Learned that from my triathlon running uncle. That'll fix most of the groggy, shitty feeling. 
drink shit loads of water before bed then taking a shit in the morning sorts me out. dont get confused.
I just prevent hangovers by not drinking. I was never a big fan of alcohol or beer. Never quite understood why drink other than to hang out with friends.
[Emergen-c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergen-C) is a damn miracle.  Take that with a bunch of water, and you will be feeling like a champ in 20 minutes. 
Don't drink. It makes you slow, stupid and docile. You'll be more aware/ appreciative of everything around you, and you'll save money you would've spent on booze. The only 'cure' for a hangover that can be 100% guaranteed.
"Its as simple as this for me, but its more a precautionary measure.  BEFORE I go to sleep after getting very drunk, I drink like 2-3 12oz bottles of water.  (just a lot of water)

I wake up maybe a little dizzy, but no sickness or headache.  Works everytime.  So while this doesn't work when you pass out, it will work if you know you are very fucked up and you can realize you want to save yourself from the impending pain the next morning.

BUT if you find yourself sick in the morning, go ahead and pound like 3-4 glasses of water (you wont want to, but force yourself) and in about 30-45 minutes you will feel much better.  The headache will still linger, but hey you won't feel sick as shit though."
"I bloody love celery! Eat celery and it will hydrate you and provide you with vitamins and all that malarkey. Discovered that while at Uni as I only had nothing else edible in the fridge.

"
I've always just drank plenty of water, eaten something starchy with protein, and taken a multivitamin to replenish some of the salts and other minerals and vitamins you pee out before I go to sleep. Only had a hangover once and that was when I forgot to do this. And of course Advil if you have a headache. Nothing special!
"Once I'm sufficiently feeling good I just start drinking a ton of water.  I then put a full glass of water near my bed when I go to sleep.  I wake up and chug it, followed by another glass.

I then eat unhealthy foods that have a ton of sodium or fat.  Bacon is my go to.  Works every time."
"Ibuprofen, Iced Coffee, Cigarette, then Gatorade.

Then a Baconator, and Large Fries (chili cheese).

But, you're better off attempting to prevent it by drinking at least equal amounts of water to booze."
With your glass of water before bed, have a multivitamin.  Replenishes all those minerals you're losing from the excessive urination.  A nice salty before-bed snack can't hurt either.
"Simple things, but help emensely:
1. Glass of water in the evening and (if happens to wake up) in the middle of a night.
2. Black tea with milk and sugar in the morning. Not coffee.
"
Eat absortion foods like sandwiches, pizza etc. as the night goes on. Drink a 32 Oz Gatorade right before you go to bed... Works unless you've drank 12 or more beers. Not sure with other types alcohol?
Drink a pint of water before bed, in the morning have a big greasy breakfast (full  english or something) and a bottle of irn bru ( search it in google if you dont know what it is). Afterwards have some more water to hydrate and you will be set for the day.
"Get a glass of water and two tylenol the night before. Put a little bit of salt in the glass and take one of the tylenol, then drink the whole thing. Refill the glass and put it by your bed.

The next morning, drunkenly feel around for the other tylenol and drink that second glass of water. Now you're hydrated, so we're doing alright. Head on down to the bathroom because you probably have to pee. Watch those lights! Shield your eyes if necessary. 

Okay, so we're hydrated and we got the tylenol, let's move to the second step. You want protein and something dense to put in your tummy... if you are too drunk to make bacon, an egg will do, but personally I like having a few strips and some toast. Light butter. 

Optional step is obviously just burnin' one up and getting cozy with some Braveheart/Ferris Bueller/The Warriors, but whatever. 

Feel better, buddy!"
My favorite trick is that first thing when I wake up is to have a small glass of water. I then proceed to make a grilled cheese sandwich with a fried egg inside of it, this helps somehow. When I sit down to eat this I make sure to have some form of iced tea with me; arizona, xing, home brewed, whatever. Afterwards I take my shower and I feel fine all ill effects are gone.
"Before I pass out from drinking I make sure to finish 3 glasses of water and try to eat a snack. Then I wake up and drink more water and get mexican food.
Works every time "
"Bacon is scientifically proven to cure a hangover. I'll get the source of my saved links in a sec.

EDIT: here ya go http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/5118283/Bacon-sandwich-really-does-cure-a-hangover.html"
I take a multivitamin and wash it down with gatorade before bed, then in the morning I have a fat/protein filled meal, an aspirin and some cranberry juice.  If I'm feeling too sick to eat, I smoke some weed first.
Very good an interesting [vid] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soo4f6e1zCs) on scientific hangover cures.
"Step one, before bed, Drink a glass of orange juice.

Step two, wake up, take a shower, go to Taco Bell and eat something (other than the nachos, they don't do as well as other stuff) I recommend about any burrito or a chalupa beef supreme "
"1. Get 10 saltines and a glass of water. 

2. Eat the saltines without drinking any water.  This is easier than you think, if your mouth is super dry in the morning take a sip of water before the crackers. 


3. Chug the glass of water

4. Instantly feel better,"
the best cure to a hangover is postponing it to the next day. now Reddit, what's your best drink when your already hungover? 
I drink a 5 hour energy five hours before I plan on sleeping. Usually 8pm-9pm, the time I start drinking alcohol. Only time I have hangovers is when I forget to do this.
old timer told me to eat ginger before drinking, and that helps, i know it doesnt help you OP but remember that for next time, it works!
I drink a Rockstar Recovery and order some Chinese food. Electrolytes and vitamins in the energy drink help replenish stuff, so does the egg in the fried rice and the all the salts. Preferably on the couch watching a Godzilla movie. This method has become so ritualized with my buddies and I that the recovery day is almost enjoyable. 
take a raw egg ... crack the shell and drop yolk and egg white into a medium grade beer. Coors, Bud, Miller ... will do fine. Drink the whole things down at once. It about 10 minutes you will start to feel a little better. In an hour you will be ready for action ! Happy New Year !!!
Just to be that annoying person. I have never had a hangover. Ever. In 13 years. I drink just as much as most people ( and I'm Scottish so that is probably quite a lot) and always mix drinks,  but have never felt any worse than 'just a bit sleepy'. I'm not complaining, this is an awesome super power, but I have always wondered, why?
Water, tons of it. Drink as much as you can before bed and have a glass with 2 advil waiting on your nightstand. Works like a charm
Drink as much water as you can before you go to bed. The next day drink lots of tea (since water will probably taste disgusting now), have soup, fruit, vegetables etc and any food with high water content.
I'm sure [r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees) would have a suggestion for you.  And a good one at that.
"1. Drink water. 2 glasses.
1. Take a fat stinky shit.
1. Shower.
1. Get something to eat.

Works every time.

By the way, whenever I go out drinking I drink water throughout the night and then before bed. It really helps."
2 aspirin and a glass of water before bed. I wake up to a superfood green smoothie and a bottle of pedialite. Works like a charm. 
Amino Acids and essential minerals (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium) before drinking, when I get home from drinking, and the next morning. I use Musclepharm's Amino1 as it has it all.
This probably doesn't help the currently hung over, but drinking water between drinks will help you out for next time.
"Knowing when to stop.

If you don't know, eat banana and drink at least a huge glass of water before going to bed.

"Bacon and cheese sandwich or pot. 

EDIT: I knew I saw it somewhere a while back and I don't think it was on Reddit, but I could be wrong. That's what happens when you have too much of one of those. [-BACON!-](http://bacontoday.com/scientists-proclaims-“bacon-sandwich”-the-ultimate-hangover-cure/) "
"No one has suggested puking yet? Before you start chugging water/gatorade before you go to bed, just puke your brains out. Seriously, get that shit out of your stomach and you will feel much better.

Also eat before you start drinking. Or drink some milk. One thing that really helps me is just simply throwing in a few glasses of water throughout the night. Do it in private if you dont wanna come off as a pussy, but that helps keep your body hydrated. And it actually gives me more energy to be honest. "
drink a glass of water for every serving of alcohol, most hangovers are due to dehydration from the liver pulling water out of your system to flush out the alcohol (front of your brain dehydrated) ( same thing as a migrane[some kinds])
Read this in an LPT a while ago: Before you go to bed after a night of drinking, make sure (if possible) to drink a bottle of water. That way during your sleep you regain some of the water in your body and you wake up with minimal hang over effects and most of the time no hang over at all.
I've found V8 works wonders.  It's best if you drink it before bed.  I put down two cans last night - Wake up feeling like a new man.
It's easy. Take a gram of ibuprofen when you wake up with two glasses of water, then go back to sleep for a half hour. No headache. Take another gram in five hours or so when the headache come back.
There are these miracle OTC chewable tablets called Nauzenes-- usually in the same section as Dramamine. Pop four of those and chew, follow with a glass of water and BAM. Cured. 
There is no cure. However...1 Advil no drowsy sinus(teh gunk tends to settle up there when you're knocked out). Stay up for an hour or two and eat something, then a quick power nap followed by a hot shower. That's about the best you're going to feel. Trust me. I was a professional for several decades before I quit drinking last year...
"7 years as a chef in the restaurant biz:

Previous night: pint of water and headache pills.

Waking up: Headache pills, redbull, hot and cold shower and greasy bacon platter breakfast. If your really suffering a cold drink of what ever you can down easily (Bacardi Breezer personal fav) and take a sauna.

Proof: retested today."
Drink a Bloody Mary. It has vodka and tomato juice. Vodka gets you a little buzz, and the juice is juice.
"I have this amazing trick to get rid of hangovers forever. It works 100% of the time.


When I see alcohol...I don't drink it."
Drink Emergen-C, take two Ibuprofen, wait 15 minutes, throw up previous two things, eat a banana, and then go back to sleep for an hour. You'll wake up good as new!
"Honestly your body needs electrolytes, and something with an abnormally high amount of them, like pedialyte, will help you recover quicker.  
And leafy greens.  The darker the better."
Hit the gym. The amount of water that you consume there is very satisfying for a dehydrated body, plus the protein feed of greasy chicken and stuff after works wonders too.
"- Start taking vitamins
- glass of water and ibuprofen before bed
- another glass of water right when you wake up, even if you end up falling back asleep"

Mcdonalds, greasy grease mcgreaser. Roughly 30 mins after ya eat it, you shit your brains out and feel golden. Or at least I do haha :p
Prevention. Drink a ton of water or gatorade before you go to bed that night, and then again first thing in the morning. Make sure you eat something that night, preferably something with some salt, fat, and fiber. Learn what drinks cause hangovers in you and avoid those- sugary stuff really does me in.
Alka-Seltzer before bed, a Vitamin Water and Red Bull in the morning. Nothing can withstand that combo. Trust me, I'm a college student with passion for little aside from drinking. 
"Take a handful of Vitamin B1 (Thiamine). It will speed up your metabolism. Best part is that it's water soluble, so you can't have too much. You'll just pee out what you don't need.

I usually take B1 right before going to bed. I wake up hangover free."
"wake up in the morning and feel hungover? Drink another beer.

It sounds disgusting at the time and its usually the last thing you want to do but it will help.

Now if you want to PREVENT getting hungover, try to drink at least 1 glass of water for every drink you had that night. if you lost count, drink at least 6. Stay hydrated."
Drink a tall glass of water.  Go on a bike ride to sweat it out.  Bike to the coffee shop and have some coffee.  That doesn't always 100% cure me, but it will at least take a big edge off.
Two aspirin (not ibuprofen or  acetaminophen) and a large glass of water before bed. wake up hangover free. Hangover is caused by dehydration, aspirin helps to thin the blood to allow rapid rehydration. 
Semi-large dose of aspirin followed with copious amounts of water. If you puke /meh you'll be fine in the morning and if not you'll be fine in the morning.  Hydrating a whole day before knowing there's going to be a binge usually kills the hangover all together imo.
A few bowls of weed the next day will kill the hangover instantly. I've never had a hangover that wasnt cured without weed
"On New Years Eve, I drank this ""hangover cure"" called Condition. It's in South Korea, and of course Psy is the spokesperson for it. Whatever it was, it did wonders. Koreans are serious drinkers, so they take their hangovers and ways to prevent them very seriously. They even have a soup called hangover soup (Haejangguk), and it is absolutely delicious. If you want to cure your hangover, take some advice from the Koreans. They are not messing around over here. "
Really not that hard. Gatorade before you go to bed and maybe a multivitamin and some rockstar recovery the morning after. Good to go. Drink more water than you think you need.

Fluids really help, I believe low sodium V8 and water to be the best.  It replaces potassium that is depleted from drinking alcohol.  Xanax really helps to cure the transition from incredibly drunk to painfully hungover.  Obviously this isn't legal for most people, but it still helps the most in times of a serious hangover.
While I was in Japan, this drink (ukon no chikara) saved me countless times http://yonasu.com/ukon-no-chikara/ I drunk it in the morning when I felt like throwing up and it cured me in like 30mins. Unfortunately it's only sold in Japan. **I have NO IDEA why anti-hangover drinks aren't sold worldwide**.
Powerade for the rehydration and electrolytes. Helps settle acidity in the stomach. And pringles for something to help with salt and food which gives you energy. Works like a charm everytime. 
a big glass of water with sugar. it has always worked for me and i only wake up with a head, which seems a little heavier than normal. no pain, confusion or whatever.
I learned a long time ago prevention is the best cure for hangovers. When I know I'm going to be drinking, I keep a bottle of Gatorade or other electrolyte drink in my car for the end of the night, and also keep a packet of powdered gatorade on me. 
Mix half a tsp of sodium bicarbonate (you can get it at any pharmacy), 1/4 cup of water at room temperature, and the juice from 1 whole lime. 2 Motrins and down the hatch all at once.
I don't get hungover too often, but when I do I just lay down and stay down. Take the day off to J off and drink some water.
Buy 2 of those Gatorade/Powerades, the big ones that are usually 2 for $3 or something. Drink one before bed and one when you wake up. It's pretty easy.
"On top of other things mentioned here such as hydrating yourself, replenishing your salts, and smoking weed, there is always room for nootropics. Check out /r/nootropics for more info.


When you drink, your brain is working faster to deal with your drunk ass, the same way it works faster when you take a bunch of adderall to study. When you do these things, your brain uses your acetylcholine reserves faster. When your acetylcholine levels are low, you feel the brain fog and headache and shitty feeling associated with a hangover or an adderall crash. 

Your brain worked too hard, now it's tired and it's working to replenish its levels. So what's the most logical thing to do? Give it more acetylcholine! 


Every day I take an acetyl-L-carnitine and a choline. These supplements do wonders, look them up. When it comes to alcohol, L-carnitine lessens the motor control loss you experience, it helps metabolize the alcohol in your body faster, and it replenishes your acetylcholine levels. So before I drink, I pop another choline and acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR). 


Then in the morning, I drink a Monster Rehab (not the regular monster) which is specifically designed for the hungover - it replenishes your salts, your acetylcholine levels (it has lots L-carnitine and taurine in it), and it hydrates you, and it has tea extracts that also help.
This stuff always saves me, works like a charm every time.


You can buy these nootropics on amazon for cheap.


tl;dr: Before and after drinking, take some choline and L-carnitine (you should be taking these every day too), drink a Monster Rehab in the morning."
"1) Salted and peppered fried eggs
2) Coffee or tea - fluids with mild caffeine

"The best cure is a good preventative, and what works for me is Gatoraid. When you drink a lot, you pee a lot, and that causes dehydration which is one of the symptoms of a bad hangover. Whenever I know I'm going to be drinking a good bit, I always bring one of those bigger bottles of Gatoriad with me and stow it in my purse or jacket. After I've had my last drink of the night, I crack open that sucker and sip on it over the course of an hour or so. Gatoraid contains a lot of sodium and sugars, which your body gets rid of when you pee, plus potassium. 

I've only had a hangover once, but ever since I started ending the nights with a Gatoraid I haven't had one since. 

Not drinking until you pass out helps, too. "
Honestly, lots of sugar and greasy foods, so a bacon sandwich and a Coke (not Diet) would be perfect.

I take a multivitamin before I pass out, then when I wake up I eat honey, a banana, and either peanut butter or almonds. The honey is a simple sugar so it breaks down quickly and gives you some energy, sooner than later. The banana has potassium in it, which is essential for your brain and other parts of the body, plus its not acidic like oj, so not as rough on the stomach. The peanut butter gives you some fats and proteins, plus fiber helps remove toxins from your body, well mainly cholesterol, but it helps. And the multivitamin works as my own Myers cocktail. I can't afford the $99 bag, and my nursing friends hold out on me, so I just pop one or two pills before bed and by the time I wake up my body has broken down the pills and spread the goodness through my body. If all else fails make friends with nurses, who are not selfish, and see if they will set you up with n iv drip. Shit works very well. You may have to through them some dolla bills, but hey 30minute hangover cure beats a day of feeling like a bag of shit.
If you feel nauseous drink a coke slurpee. The coke syrup helps coat your stomach and keeps you from puking your brains out all day.

Whenever I get home from a night of drinking, I make sure to take a multivitamin with a tall glass of V8 vegetable juice before bed. Then I go to sleep in the fetal position while clutching a water bottle. Works every time.
Drink water in between drinks of alcohol while you're out. It's the simplest thing ever, and I never get hangovers.
Sleep for as long as possible. Have a poo. Chocolate milkshake, for sugar (energy) and the milk helps the stomach irritation. Sit for 10 to 30 minutes depending on level of nausea. Also take a painkiller of choice at this point (paracetamol will prolong the hangover and damage the liver more, ibuprofen or aspirin will up the stomach irritation, so if you can go without, otherwise just try one rather than both). Follow this with a BLT and some sprite and you're on your way to replenishing your fluids and salts. Usually by this point Im ready to start again. Or go to lectures/work. 
Not a cure, but you can prevent one by taking a B complex vitamin and drinking water before sleeping.  Kind of hard to do that if you're already unconscious, though. :)
Pork Pies. And lots of water. Any pork product really, and the water to keep you hydrated from all the salt in that pork. But pork pies work especially well.
Smoke some weed, eat some bacon and eggs or an omelet, drink some coffee. Hell the bud alone usually fixes it.
Naked Juice Green Machine and a bottle of water. Once you feel a bit better from that, get some actual food in you. Works every time.

"Depends on the hangover:

Headache - bottle of water with 3 aspirin and 4 advil. (I also take this right before I go to sleep, and I rarely wake up with a hangover.)

Stomach ache - bitters and soda. Works like a fucking miracle."
"I feel qualified to answer this, not from science, but because I am damned near allergic to alcohol, and my hangovers have lasted as long as two days before I could even get out of bed. I don't know why.

The only true ""cure"" to a hangover is prevention. So when I'm drinking, I drink 1 glass of water for every drink. Then, when I get home, I make a big spinach salad with seasoned, kinda greasy grilled chicken on it. I eat that and drink a bottle of Gatorade, and take a couple Advil. Next morning, no hangover. I honestly don't know what the chicken and spinach do, but I just happened to eat it one night and I didn't have the soul-crushing headache I thought I would. I tried it again and no hangover. For someone who gets such severe hangovers, this was a life-altering discovery. 

Maybe the sciencey types on here can tell me about spinach and chicken."
"Last night, one of my friends swore that if we all ate lots of almonds while drinking, we'd wake up with no hangovers.

Sure enough, I woke up on a couch without a hangover and feeling SUPER ENERGIZED.  However, a lot of us also threw up last night, and I don't know whether the vomiting is a result of the almonds, or the lack of hangover is related to the vomiting."

Idk about you guys but I always have munchies after drinking, so i always end up eating. Anyway, I jus pop a 400-600mg ibuprofen (Motrin) before bed. Guaranteed no hangover for me.

"Multi-vitamin, water, and a full stomach is really the only thing that works. Most of those OTC hangover cures are basically just multi-vitamins. 
Not too much coffee as it dehydrates you.
If you have the time obvs a shot of tequila is nice, but it doesn't really cure it; just feels better."
Seeing as how I can get so drunk I vomit and fail to effectively stand upright and still not be hungover, I'm likely not going to be of much help here. However, I have HEARD that eating eggs is helpful, and bacon as well. So my suggestion is as soon as you feel well enough to hold down food, have a bacon and egg sandwich and drink plenty of water.
taking a huge dump then a hot shower then eat a bagel while drinking lots of water. quick 1 hr nap then I'm usually sober and healthy again.
"In college I used to chug a fruit punch gatorade the second I woke up (room temperature to prevent further upsetting my stomach). This served two purposes, it would replenish electrolytes and rehydrate; and if I did end up puking it didn't taste as god awful as usual. 

Now when I am super hung over I go to Boloco and get a massive burrito and a fruit smoothie.  "
Pedialyte works well (so I've heard). It's that strangely-delicious syrup stuff you give to infants with diarrhea to rapidly hydrate. It's full of electrolytes and other tasty nutrients. I've mixed it with Gatorade to dilute it and to change the taste, and it works like a charm. 
"The best thing to do is to prevent it. Since it's new year's day, you're probably not looking for that. The best fixes are salty, meaty and greasy foods (bacon's good), 400mg or so of ibuprofen, and as much water as you can drink. Sleep, too.

Next time, try to prevent it:

I have a friend whose drink-night ritual is to go to a fast food joint before drinking and buy two big burgers. One he eats before drinking, the other he throws on his bed still in the wrapper. When he gets home from drinking, drunk-him finds the burger left by sober-him and eats it. Apparently it works.

For me, water and ibuprofen works best. Drink water throughout the night as you're getting drunk. You'll pee more, but whatever. Then make sure there's a bottle of water next to your bed. You'll wake up sometime in the night to pee. Go, then drink as much water as you can stomach and re-fill the bottle. Take 400-800mg of ibuprofen. Hopefully it's around 6-8 AM when this happens. Go back to bed and keep sleeping. You'll wake up 1-2 hours later feeling way, way better."
"Drink a large glass of water before ping to bed. You get hungover because you're dehydrated (I think). 

Works like a charm! 

Also add a Tylenol for safe measure."
Gatorade and a protein shake if I have little time/tired. Pancakes, OJ and tea (maybe eggs and bacon) if I have some time/don't mind doing dishes at 3am.
Cheap fizzy lemonade.  Panda pop if you can find it.  This will only work in the UK though because as far as I know you only get proper lemonade in America where they don't have access to the mostly lemon less WW2 era crap we have.
"I always try to remember to drink water before I go to bed. If that failed, or I still have a hangover, I have a few things I want to do:
-Drink coconut water. It's extra hydrating because of all the vitamins, which is exactly what your body needs to be replenished.
-Take a shower. Make it a quick one so you don't dry out your skin (anything to irritate your body will be more uncomfortable than usual today). Switch from hot to cold a few times. I forget why that helps but it definitely does.
-eat breakfast and take some vitamins. I like multivitamins and zinc, sometimes vitamin D but that's because I live in Washington and sunlight is rare this time if year. Make sure your breakfast has good proteins and fats, and natural sugars (toast with an egg and some fruit or juice is great). Make sure there's salt in there too. (side note: I once had just coconut water and salami after waking up from food poisoning (which has similar effects on the body) and felt great after that. Salami has salt, fat, and protein, which the body needs to replenish then.)
-SLEEP! If you can't get it, caffeine. But drink tea, not coffee, because coffee is more dehydrating which you really don't need. I like Yerba mate with some mint leaves and honey, it has more caffeine than coffee but won't make you crash later and promotes focus and energy.

Good luck, drunkies :)"
Drink a glass of water between beers. or shots. or whatever. Then you don't GET hungover in the first place.
Besides smoking a joint, I try to drink Pedialyte, It's a drink for infants who are severely dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. Its basically like drinking snow cone syrup, but after the first sips with an advil and 15 minute nap. I start to feel a lot better.    
I'll do you one better, prevention. No matter how much I drink this always helps: before your drunk self goes to sleep, drink two glasses of water and if you feel it might be necessary some aspirin. This prevents the hangover because what people feel as a hangover is due to dehydration, drinking this much water before bed will prevent, or at least greatly decrease the severity, your hangover. If this does not work, eat a greasy breakfast in the morning, the fat will help :) and water! Lots of water!
Before I go out drinking I put a 2liter water bottle and a banana on my nightstand. When I get home drunk I eat the banana and drink the entire bottle of water. 60% of the time, it works every time.
Drink one of [these](http://www.functiondrinks.com/link.php?pageID=urbandetox) before you go to bed.  No hangover to start with.
One, sometimes two, Rockstar energy drinks. I thinks it is the massive doses of B vitamins. Within 1/2 hour - 45 minutes I'm feeling much better. 
"Drink water as you're drinking alcohol. Then a nice wake and bake the next morning will give you a huge appetite to eat some food and after a big meal you will feel much much better.

Like others said already, it's best to to prevent a hangover then to try to cure one."
Hot coffee mixed evenly with cold milk. It's room temperature so the body absorbs it immediately, and the caffeine/fat mixture helps break the headache almost instantly.
Hydrate night before, electolyte pills, etc. if this fails, smoke a bowl in the morning, drink some more water and go back to bed.
"Throw up before bed then drink water, go to bed with a big cup of water.   If you wake up at all through out the night drink more water.  If you get up to pee, drink more water.  When you wake up have a Guinness for breakfast.  ""Hair of the Dog that bit ya"""
I had the worst hangover I've ever heard od/alcohol poisoning. My fiancé went and got a KFC variety big box, I ate that and instantly felt better.
Stop drinking at least an hour before bed and during that next hour drink a lot of water and eat some food. I drink pretty hard on say nights and haven't had a hangover in at least a few years using this method. 
This probably won't be very popular but back when I was still tying them on regularly I found that if I matched my drink intake with a glass of water it would drastically reduce hangovers. This is easier I'd you're at a bar rather than at a party or something. At a bar I would just order a glass of water with each beer and basically match it drink for drink. 
For instant recovery, drink more in the morning. Just a few sips should do. Also drink some water and eat something.

Ok, this worked for me yesterday, New years day. I stayed up til seven am drinking at a party, was ridiculously drunk, pretty much guaranteed a hangover of monumental proportions. What I did was force myself not to go to bed straight away. I drank 2 litres of water and watched TV for about an hour. I then took 1g paracetamol, not aspirin. Had some sleep then I felt fine enough to go watch the hobbit the next day. This has worked for me so many times in the past, it's the combination of actually sobering up *before* you go to bed and drinking shitloads of water.
MIDOL (yes, even if you're a male)! It has as much caffeine as drinking 2 cups of coffee + pain relivers for your headache! Take it with Gatorade and discover sweet salvation. (Bonus- you don't have to actually drink coffee now, goodbye dry mouth)
"1. Eat pickles
2. Drink pickle juice (if you have a good quality pickle, the juice is tasty)
3. Drink Gatorade

Do not drink any significant amount of water until the hangover is gone.  If you desperately need a mouthful or to just swish it around in your mouth, that's fine.  All the liquid you consume should be in pickle juice or Gatorade form.  "
In regards to drinking, I'm more often hungover following an episode if drinking then not. The absolute best way to cure a hangover is to prevent it by taking vitamins before you pass out. I know this takes a little responsibility on the drinkers part, but it works every time. Because drinking removes minerals from your body, you can restore those by taking a vitamin. My favorite way is with some sort of chewable vitamin so you get a little snack tight before bed. Try it out next time you're hitting the sauce.
"Coconut Water. I swear by it. It's used as plasma in some countries. 

One before bed & if I feel bad enough, which I shouldn't if I drink the first one, one in the morning.

A Latin soup dish called Menudo. It's greasy, meaty, super salty, and spiced to taste. Throw some diced onions and cilantro in the mix to kick it up.
When I was in the Army I'd run an IV into my foot on a pretty regular basis on Saturday mornings, and that worked really well. 
Drink Gatorade. That's what I am currently doing. It's best though before passing out; unless you are on the same boat as me and blacked out as well.
"Prevention: Coconut water and prickly pear juice

Cure: Milk thistle extract, bananas, eggs

College cure: Fistful of ibuprofen and a beer"
A spicy Bloody Mary and eggs benedict. At least that was the cure this morning, but it doesn't help with the self loathing I feel post-New Years shenanigans.
two liters of water before bed after a night of drinking will prevent any hangover. the trick is remembering to do this.
"Prevent a hangover by being sensible and alternating alcohol/soft drinks all night long. Lots of water throughout and enough food before as during. 

Help a hangover with a method I've perfected. I shock my body into feeling better by standing outside in the cold for 10 minutes then having the hottest bath I can bare for as long as I have to spare. Then some orange juice and optional pain killers. Food as soon as you can stomach it and you should feel perfect! "
tons of water, gatorade. If nausea is an issue I tend to not want to eat which actually drags the hangover and nausea out so I work into it slowly eat a banana they have natural sugars and vitamins you need, they are also a natural antacid so they can cure up that nausea for you. Seltzer too, carbonated drinks ease nausea, but all the sugars and caffeine in soda dehydrates you more, so seltzer dat carbonated water doe.
Sleeping it off and waking up occasionally to hydrate. Otherwise plenty of water before sleep and when i wake up, some advil, gatoraide. If i can usually a trip to 5 guys for a baconcheesebuger. Weed. 
Don't drink so much. But if you must then drink a 50/50 mixture of Gatorade and water take some Motrin and eat some form bread. Doughnuts are awesome because they also give you a small boost of energy. Continue the Gatorade water mixture. You will feel better in no time
I always keep a little tiny bottle of Advil (Ibuprofen) when out drinking at another person's house. I dont usually get hangovers, but if I do, I pop an Advil and am feeling great in 10 minutes and for the rest of the day.
"Water, water water water. Drink as much as you can before passing the fuck out. Trying to drink it in the morning once the hangover has already set in is terrible in the morning.

What I usually end up doing though is just sleeping through it. Terrible unrestful sleep, but hangover fades away unnoticed. "
Heyy Reddit, so I live the netherlands and every year there is new years dive. Basically everyone gathers at Scheveningen and wears orange hats and funny costumes and at 12 you run into the atlantic ocean. I did it today after a brutal last night and it did cure my hangover, except now i'm sick... 1500 people showed up. Here's a photo from previous years http://www.globalpost.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/gp3_fullpage/ice-swim-freezing-water-polar-bear-2-20110101.jpg
Pop a motrin and drink a quart of water before you pass out. Same thing in the AM if you forget, but gatorade instead of water.
Cup of green tea. A greasy ass breakfast. And as soon as I am able, a little exercise. If all that fails, get drunk again. 
"Vit C, vit B complex, mutli vitamin, OJ, banana, and pain meds. 

One of the most leached vitamin from your system is B12."
"Before bed: eat something (mmmm, kebab), and have some water

Next morning if feeling rough, get some water in you, and a bacon butty.

Never fails"
"Weed,
Provides graving for food.  It also reduces the discomfort untill the food evenatually cures the symptoms."
2 paracetamol, 2 ibuprofen washed down with a berocca dissolved in energy drink or lucozade. (Lucozade is preferable if the drink the night before involved energy drink; jaeger-bombs, vodka red-bull etc) works like a charm
"Preparation: Before you go out to drink, put a 32 oz NON RED Powerade (I like zero.) or Gatorade on your nightstand. Next to it, put a bottle of excedrin. I like excedrin the best, but you can sub it out for plain tylenol or aspirin.

Now, go out and make merry. 

When you get home, chug the powerade (it goes down easier when it's room temp) and take 2 excedrins. Go to bed, and sleep that mofo off. You'll wake up feeling a hellova lot more human than you would otherwise."
I drink probably 5 pints of water before I go to bed & when I wake up I eat a few slices of toast with butter and Marmite. Works wonders
"Hangover is basically a brain dehydration so the easiest way to cure it is so prevent it by drinking loads of water just before going to bed.

Drinking a pint of water before falling asleep is my standard routine every time I go out drinking. Regardless how smashed I get I always remember to do it and I haven't had bad hangover ever since. "
throw up, drink water, sleep, wake up, drink water, 2 painkillers, shower, breakfast, cigarette and coffee.
May sound trivial, but I found brushing your teeth before bed and drinking a 16oz water bottle works absolute wonders.  I may only wake up with a minor headache, but take 2 advil or aspirin and your set to go.
I drink a glass if water for every alcoholic drink. Haven't had a hangover in years. (And, yes, I still drink!)
"Science be damned.  Hangover cures are the domain of home remedies for good reason.

I rehydrate with equal quantities of gatorade and water, then eat something disturbingly fatty and salty.  McNuggets are wonderful for this.  Take 10 and call me in the morning.

I find coffee is also helpful but that might just be because coffee withdrawal amplifies the hangover pain."
Eat a banana and drink a Gatorade before you start pounding down water. Starting with water flushes the nutrients you are already lacking. 
Before you go out put a chair on the bed with a pint of water and alker seltzer+ on it. so when you walk in drubk you have to take it off before you go to bed so just as easy to down the water and salts. therefore re-hydrate and take the edge of your head when you wake.
"An IV full of saline.

No, but really...I've tried a few different things.  My most effective and memorable hangover recovery was from drinking powerade, and eating a greasy McD's burger (the CBO).  "
Lay in the tub for two hours while the shower runs. Drink a bottle of cheap champagne and masterbate. Done.
"A little ""long bottom leaf"", some pho, some sleep and a proper ass whopping workout the following morning. Simple, sweet but effective. "
I've worked as a private bartender as my on/off part time job for about 4 years now. I have seen/experienced just about every kind of hangover imaginable. The following is the best method, by far, that I have found; Alka-Seltzer in cold water. Down the whole glass immediately after waking up, DO NOT MIX WITH ANYTHING. Within 20 minutes your head will stop pounding, your stomach will not do a flip every time you move, and even the smell of alcohol will be tolerable. This method has worked for me and everyone I have given it to. every. time.
I used to stumble to my local diner and eat scrambled eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon and Coke.    Not really a trick, though.   
Alka Seltzer. Most people of my generation don't even know this stuff still exists, but it works absolute wonders on a hangover. No headache, no nausea. Easy.
Dunno any 'scientific' ways to cure, but what always works for me is waking up the morning after, get up, go for walk to coffee house, get hot coffee and muffin, eat/drink on way home. Doesn't 'cure' the hangover, but it does make the day bearable. 
Friend of mine swears by Alka-Seltzer. I've not tried it yet, but he gets really fucked up sometimes, so I guess he would know.
Lots and lots of water/gatorade, some fruit for breakfast, and I've always found taking a stronger antacid always helps with the nausea, tums doesn't do it for me but if I take one zantac when I wake up I feel better in 20 minutes.
Bacon and egg sandwich, lots of water and orange juice, and a light workout (push ups, squats, sit ups, and maybe a ride on a stationary bike or a jog) to break a sweat, followed by a few cups of coffee and a 30 minute nap.
I'm sure it's just a placebo effect, but I always find that the nastiest, greasiest cheeseburger and fries I can find help immensely. Also water. So much water.
"I always make sure I have a bottle of lucozade sport in the fridge if I'm heading out for a night of drinking. Neck that with a bananaaanaanana and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps and you've got yourself a winner. 
"
Pho is the best for me. I normally have to get my friend to take me there because I'm too hungover to drive but after a bowl I feel fantastic.
Potassium Gluconate pill from GNC or Pharmacy. One of the reasons you are hung over is lack of potassium. Before, during or after drinking this works wonders.
5 hour energy, or a Energen-C packet. Seriously, the vitamin B in those things straighten you out QUICK!!!
An old Irish remedy is fish and pickles. Sounds kinda nasty but I just make a tuna sandwich with relish and wash it down with gatorade. Works every time and its delicious. 
"At least one glass of water 1~ hour before bed, if coherent enough take daily multivitamin and some ibuprofen.


  I have yet to find this to not work."
well the best trick is not to drink. But when I did, I used to drink quite a bit of v8 juice and water. Worked every time.
"My trick is to have an energy drink as my last drink and two pain killers and a glass or two of water before bed. I usually wake up feeling better than expected! 
"
"I've had so many deathly hangovers, and this is what helps the most.  Pain killers + orange juice + chewing gum + brushing teeth + sip a sports drink and eat some light foods = what works best.  If i had to pick one of the above it would be chewing gum. It gets rid of that ""My mouth tastes and feels like a beer factory"" effect and its AMAZING.  "
"Wake up, tall glass of water.
Breakfast Taco Bell #6 with Steak in the Cahlupas and the Soft Taco, NO SODA. Instead Jamba Juice Strawberry Surf Rider with wheat grass and energy boost. "
I make sure I drink an entire 32 oz of gatorade before going to bed. Guess this is prevention, though. 
Wake up early, drink a glass of water, then try to sleep the hangover off. By the time you wake up at a regular time, headache will be gone and you'll just need to have some more water.
"Until the age of 25 I rarely had a hangover so bad it slowed me down. Shit-Shower-Coffee. Good to go.

25-28 required some serious help. After **thoroughly** emptying the contents of my stomach I would turn to copious amounts of water + vicodan. An hour later I was able to function ""normally"".

from 28-31 there was no cure. All the drugs in the world couldn't stop the searing hell my body was in. 

31-now - No alcohol to begin with. Being an alcoholic sucks, but it sucks a hell of a lot less when I don't drink.

Seriously though - stay as hydrated as possible while drinking and your hangover will be greatly reduced."
I have a hard time sleeping while drunk, so I usually wake up early, chug a big cup of water, and then go get McDonalds breakfast. Hangover gone in about an hour.
"Prevention.

Drink 1 glass of alcohol, drink 1 glass of water. Sometimes 2 glasses of water between alcoholic drinks. 

Do I go to the bathroom a lot more than my friends during the night? Yes.

Do I wake up feeling much better than my friends in the morning? Yes."
"My brother turned me on to this and it does help. 

2 alka seltzer plus tabs in A 20 oz Gatorade G2 bottle, any flavor will do, but it has to be alka seltzer plus and G2. 

Wait until the alka seltzer is fully dissolved, chug half, and sip the rest. "
"The obvious answer is not drinking too much the night before.  It is called self control and self respect. 
"
"My wife likes KFC fried chicken and mashed potatoes with gravy. 

Thankfully I usually don't get hungover but bloody Mary's (heavy on the clear liquor) usually work for me. I drink lots of water most of the time anyway so I usually keep hydrated while I'm drinking, this probably helps me."
"There is no reactive cure to a hangover that I've found works. What I do is open a can of coke before I go out and put it in the fridge. Get a box of those glucose drink sachets, put one in the back pocket. If your out drinking for say 6 hours halfway through get a half pint of water chuck in a sachet and down it. Then when you get home have a Big glass of water and the flat cold coke from the fridge. Have yet to experience anything other than a mild headache yet.

"My biochem prof in college preventatively prescribed water and vitamin b12 before sleeping. So I drink a large water bottle and eat some gummy vites before sleeping. I've been hangover free for 4 years. 

Also there's a soup we Koreans literally call ""The Hangover Soup"" (해장국 or hae-jang-gook) which works wonders. If I can get to a Korean restaurant, that has always been my brunch of choice after a long night. That or some pho. "
"Eat a banana before passing out. Down a few glasses of water if you can, and keep a full glass next to your bed/couch/bathtub/wherever you happen to pass out. Drink more water in the morning. A glass of OJ with a greasy breakfast and ginger tea if you're still having stomach problems in the morning. A Caesar/Bloody Mary is an excellent choice for hair of the dog if you can handle it.

Treating a hangover requires an assault from many directions. There is no one cure, there are many cures for different aspects of a hangover. And the most effective cure will depend on you; on what the worst part of your hangover is and the cure that takes best with you. Trial and error, baby, is what it takes."
"Don't cure it, avoid it in the first place.

1. Eat beforehand. Don't drink on an empty stomach, it'll just get you drunk quicker. 
2. Drink water in between drinks. This is especially useful if you're drinking mainly cocktails or any kind of hard liquor. Just ask the bartender for a glass of water and they'll give it to you. 
3. Eat afterward. Something salty and greasy is best, like pizza. There are a lot of pizza places that remain open into the AM.
4. Drink another glass of water before you go to bed.

Basically, keep yourself hydrated and eat something salty afterward. "

"Fool proof: 
Before going to bed, no matter how drunk you are, drink a big glass of water. When you inevitably wake up for a pee in the middle of the night, do your business and then drink *another* glass of water before going back to bed. Lster, rinse repeat, by the time you wake up in the morning, you'll be that many glass of water ahead of the game!"

"I can comfortably say that the trick to curing a hangover, is to avoid them altogether. 

Start taking a B complex vitamin for a couple weeks, then take one before you go out drinking. Drink as much as you want. When you get home, 4 Advil (1000mg) and chug a Gatorade.

Should all else fail, marijuana will get the rest of that hangover mopped up and ready to go. "
Stay hydrated when your drinking. Eat a peice of bread before going to sleep. Wake up, eggs, toast, and bacon. Drink a glass of OJ and take a multivitamin. Smoking weed is optional but preferred at any part of this process. Always helps me out.

"I eat a 4 egg omelette before I go out. Not only does this help with filling you up, yolks contain something that helps with breaking down alcohol. (sorry got being vague) I also eat a bit more on top.

After I've finished drinking, I drink a glass of orange juice. Not only does this help the liver break down alcohol, it also rehydrates you. I follow this up with a glass of water. 

I also usually eat prior to going to sleep, usually a subway.

Tip: If you aren't planning on going home after drinking (nudge, nudge), buy a glass of orange juice from the last bar you're at."
I go on a run to cure a mild hangover.  Nothing makes me feel better.  It feels like you sweat the sin out of your system and there is the added benefit of burning some of the calories you drank the night before.  Of course, you can't run with a severe hangover, so when it is bad, I just curl up in bed and whine.

Half gatorade/powerade half water. Has the water but also those sugary stuff to make you absorb the water easier. (I'm assuming when drunk your bodily functions like absorbing water are hindered) 
Just fucking drink a lot of water before you go to bed and get lots of sleep. Don't really understand why people have such a horrible time with hangovers. Drink lots of water during the day before drinking and a good bit immediately before you pass out. 
Most of the time if I drink a 20oz Gatorade before bed I wake up feeling okay. I still feel tired and my stomach doesn't feel great, but there's no headache which is good enough for me.

Sleep won't help you'll  just  feel bad all day and lay around wasting daylight. What follows is a fool proof method that has worked it's  magic more than once for me .  Start drinking water, a little at a time , you need to rehydrate but you don't want a ""water belly"".  Now for the secret cure: a greasy hamburger and a milkshake.   Yea you heard it right.  You are gonna get that nasty burger and just about hurl when you smell it, he'll any food smells bad now you're  hungover.  Start slow, just a nibble, and sip that milkshake. It's hard at first but about half way through it you will notice the pounding in your head stopped and you are now gobbling the hamburger down and slamming the shake. If you have it around  clam chowder also works in a pinch.  
Tl:dr  greasy hamburger and a milkshake or clam chowder "
Before passing out drink Gatorade. When you wakeup, watered down Gatorade and 3 chili cheese hotdogs. For a better effect force yourself to puke before passing out. 
Prevention is better than cure. Drink a pint of water before going to bed. In the morning drink something sugary but not fizzy. Fruit juice and cordials are best. Eat something light before going to bed too.
"First three or four drinks, mix in a glass of water between.  Then, right before bed, chug a huge glass of water.

This seems to kill just about all evidence of a hangover for me."
PREVENTION is the best cure. Drink an Emergen-C and/or take a vitamin B tablet before bed. Works reliably for me after years of testing. 
Whenever I take a shit the next day, after a night of heavy drinking, I immediately feel better. So for me, the best remedy, is drinking as much water as I can and taking a shit as soon as I can. Yeah.
"Former Army Combat Medic here.

"What I do:

1) Take 2 Advil with some iced tea or Diet Coke (I don't consume much caffeine so this makes a big difference for me), follow this with watered down Gatorade or fruit juice
2) Masturbate
3) Take the hottest shower you can stand for 5 minutes, then turn it to pure cold for 30 seconds; repeat a few times
4) Oxygen therapy if it's available (my mom as a fresh stock of O2 tanks and an oxygen concentrator I will use)
5) Eat a healthy meal as soon as you can stomach it

Half a Pediatric-Electrolyte before you go to bed, half when you wake up followed by 1-2 hard boiled eggs and a can of tomato juice.
Pedialyte. Emergen-c. Cranberry juice. Water of course. A tablespoon of prickly pear cactus juice right before you start drinking. Eat the fucking greasiest burger you can find before going out. Smoke weed. 
Drink a shit ton of water before you go to sleep and take like 3 aspirin. Also tackling a fucking delicious Chipotle burrito helps 
Rehydrate, water with a little salt will work, Gatorade, pedialite, and coconut water are all awesome too. Get some zofran on board for the nausea, pepto works too if you can't get your hands on zofran. Painkiller of choice for the headache. Next comes food, for my friends and I it's usually a diner because of the vast menu, low prices, and  their ability to serve you eggs, bacon, and french fries on the same plate. Last step is a hot shower with a beer or whatever kicked your ass the night before. This method is tried and tested and backed by medical and nursing students alike. 
"1.) A few Advil or other similar headache reliever.
2.) Vitamin-c...I usually buy that Emergen-C stuff from the store and take that as soon as I wake up.
3.) Lots of coconut water. It's got more electrolytes than powerades and sports drinks like that. 
4.) Coffee..unfortunately it's a diuretic, but it usually makes me feel a little better.

That's usually my cure, I spend the whole day just trying to get re-hydrated."
I usually just take a few hits from someone smoking weed. That has always helped me not get a hangover in the morning no matter how much i drink

Eating a bacon sandwich is supposedly good for hangovers. The carbohydrates in the bread help clear your mind from a hangover and bacon did something I can't remember also gatorade is good too. I've always wondered if drinking lots of water before sleeping would help significantly reduce a hangover too. Luckily I don't really get hangovers so I'm doing great today :)

Antioxidants & water. I have no idea why this works, but taking 2 antioxidants before passing out and 2-4 more when you wake up + a couple glasses of water will get rid of your hangover. I'm not really sure why this works, but it does. You have to take the antioxidants fairly soon after you wake up or their effect is greatly diminished, however.
It's not very nice but I always throw up and drink lots of water before going to bed. Sobering up a little before you crash helps too.

Honestly, Cannabis has worked best for me so far. It helps exponentially with dizziness and queasiness. Dry mouth is the only thing that gets worse. Plus you get a sense of euphoria to help if you were drinking as a depressed alcoholic. Just from personal experience, not scientific evidence, have I discovered this.
Seasoned drunk here, if you drink as much as me hangovers are a thing of the past. However I hear chugging pedialite before bed goes a long way.
Well you know.  I like to first get about a gallon of gasoline.  Take a few whiffs of it, just to get started.  Then I like to reach into my pantry and take out my shrooms.  I douse my clothing in the gasoline, go into my basement, light my clothing with a strike-anywhere match, and take the shrooms.  I wait for the affect to kick in and just enjoy my actions.  The hangover usually fades after that.
"eat much before you sleep, I usualy eat 4 cheese burgers. Dink a bit more water when your body is telling you to stop. And when you wake up, drink as much milk as you can. 
Does the trick for me "
"While Most of these answers are funny, unfortunately I haven't seen the real answer. Here it is for anyone who still cares. Unfortunately it's a preventative measure, and not a cure:

**Take a Zantac 150, 1 hour before starting drinking**

*Here's why it works:* Scientists don't know the exact reason for a hangover, but it is widely believed that it's excessive acetaldehyde which has built up in your system. 

The metabolic pathway for your body is:

*Ethanol*->*Acetaldehyde*->*Acetic Acid (Vinegar)*->->->*Water and CO2*

Oddly, Ethanol isn't *that* bad for you, but Acetaldehyde (Ethanal) IS bad for you. It's represented in the buzz as that room-spinny sick feeling. 

In almost all people (and especially so in half of asians) acetaldehyde metabolises slower than the ethanol does, if it doesn't, you likely wont ever get hungover. Here's how to envision the problem. Think of a vertical system of three tanks, each draining into the other. The top tank is representative of ethanol you ingested, the second of acetaldehyde, and the bottom of harmless vinegar. Your metabolic speed is represented as the piping of the drains between the tanks. So, what happens if the drain for the ethanol is faster than the drain for the acetaldehyde? You'll have a brief period where it's ethanol, then longer period where it's acetaldehyde (the crap you don't want) and eventually after a period of sickness, it will slowly drain out into becoming vinegar.

But what happens if you found a way to pinch off the drain from the ethanol tank into the acetaldehyde tank? Especially in the case where the ethanol drain is actually smaller than the acetaldehyde drain? Then you would *NEVER* have acetaldehyde build up, because it would be able to drain out faster than it is let in.

That's what zantac tries to do. It (sort of) inhibits the enzymes (alcohol dehydrogenase) responsible for converting the ethanol into acetaldehyde, (this enzyme was represented as the drain from the ethanol tank into the acetaldehyde tank in the visual example)

See, while Zantac (Chemically referred to as Rantidine) isn't exactly an inhibitor, it does a really good job at stopping your GI tract from making it's digestive juices. And while your liver is generally the chemical processing plant of your body, alcohol dehydrogenase (the enzyme in question) is found more commonly in your GI tract than in your liver. Because of this, a large portion of the alcohol you drink (often more than half) becomes Acetaldehyde before it even enters your bloodstream. If you shut off the gates that load your GI tract with these enzymes, you are able to get the ethanol into your blood before it has a chance to break down. This leaves it solely up to your liver. And this keeps the Ethanol/Acetaldehyde ratio high, and keeps you from getting sick.

The buzz takes a little longer to kick in, and isn't as pronounced (it is less stupor, and more good-feeling), however you end up feeling WAY better the next day. Try it, you'll see what I mean. Cimetidine (Tagamet) works too.

**Take an Adderall in the morning**
Unfortunately this only works if you have access and have no tolerance, and even then it's not exactly healthy. But your body kicks into overdrive and you can't even tell anything was wrong. Much better to be preventive than responsive. Try to stick to the Zantac.

I have a three step pre-emptive strike method for when I get in drunk and know I'm gonna be a mess the next day. Firstly,being of the female variety,I absolutely, without fail ,no matter how drunk i am,take my makeup off. Nothing like waking up with a disgusting face full of yesterday's crusty makeup to make you feel worse than you already do, maybe that's just a psychological thing but it makes me feel better. Secondly,I try to drink as much water as I can before i hit the sack,ideally a pint glass full.And thirdly,I take a couple of painkillers to try and stop the onslaught of a headache,then get as much sleep as I can,because tiredness is definitely a factor for me when it comes to hangovers. That's it,pretty simple but it works for me.

It's a little known (at least in the US) effervescent tablet that basically consists of Ascorbic acid, Sodium, Caffeine, and Glucuronamide (a compound that flushes toxins such as those from alcohol from your system). It is extremely widely used where I'm from, and it is basically miraculous. You might be able to get it online somewhere or if you know someone living in western europe they can get it for you. Good luck!"
Don't now why but taking a vitamin c supplement (my favorite is emergen-c) at the tail end of a bout of drinking has cut back the occurrence of hangovers to about zero.  It's been borderline miraculous frankly coming from someone who gets easily hungover.
uhm how about you go buy another bottle and start 2013 off with a nice soft landing. Why hang over when you can hang on?

Saline iv works great. But drinking water and staying in bed works fine too if you got nowhere to be.
"The way I do it is by drinking a glass of water after every drink. It's much easier than forcing 6+ glasses down before bed, and helps you pace yourself so you don't completely lose control. When the early morning comes (assuming I don't work that day), I'll take three 200mg ibuprofen caps and another huge glass of water, and then sleep for another few hours. Been doing it that way for years with great results. A little later in the afternoon, a shower helps shake off the groggy feeling. A decent sized lunch is important too.

If it's a particularly nasty one (sour stomach and whatnot), I'll eat a relatively small breakfast, as to not upset myself further. By lunchtime, I'll be pretty damn hungry, so mass feeding commences. "
Chug a glass of water before going to sleep, put a new glass of water next to bed along with a Centrum multi vitamin and an Advil Liquigel 400mg tablet.  When you wake up for a moment around 6am with a pounding headache to quench your thirst take the vitamin and Advil and go back to sleep, when you wake up you should be pretty good to go, if that fails, smoke a doob, instantly cured.

I smoke a spliff before I go to bed, not sure WHY exactly it works, but it does. Haven't woken up hung over since, maybe because marijuana helped me learn how much alcohol I can handle. If this would fail, I would roll a fresh joint in the morning, make a strawberry/banana smoothie, make me a red pepper/cottage cheese/wholewheat sandwich and take a walk. 
Monster Rehab. It hydrates, replaces electrolytes, has caffeine, is low-sugar, low-cal. Any time I'm hung over, I eat two ibuprophen, drink a Rehab, and feel right as rain within an hour.

"There is only one true remedy to cure the typical hangover in under ONE minute.
That is a saline solution IV, which replenishes deprived fluids and salts, but the IV delivers these fluids much faster than eating chicken soup, or drinking water. 
Only downside is you might need someone to administer the IV to you, but if you are ever in a hurry to be focused for the day, this is the fastest and most effective way to fix it by far."
For an upset stomach you can make your own ginger tea.  We keep ginger root on hand, it doesn't spoil quickly.  In a small pot boil thin slices of ginger root. Play with how much ginger to add.  That alone is fine but I personally like it with lemon and honey.  I also drink this when I'm actually sick.

"Ok, first, have a glass of water after every alcoholic beverage. ""I'll just be pissing all blah blah whine."" Yes, but you can drink big all night and never get too shitty.

Koreans have a soup called hangover soup and man does that work. But it has some stuff other cultures would not eat.
Drink a tall glass of water before passing out. This alleviates dehydration and dilutes the remaining alcohol in your body, making it easier to process through the liver. Also, a really greasy breakfast can't hurt. 
[A Bacon Sandwich] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/5118283/Bacon-sandwich-really-does-cure-a-hangover.html). :)
I drink a coke the next morning if I have a hangover. I think it was once sold as a hangover tonic-granted, it may have had other ingredients. I think it's the Caffeine now, but the sugar and water probably help too. Anyway, it makes me have to pee, and I feel a lot better after that.
"It's not so much a cure, as it is a prevention strategy slightly based on med school knowledge. Drink a bottle of Gatorade, and eat something that is light, not disgusting, and preferably meat based/high in protein (Pizza with topping usually works). The Gatorade replenishes the water and salt, the sugar does help with the alcohol induced hypoglycemia (NADH excess from alcohol breakdown limiting liver production of Glucose), and they get absorbed better if taken together (Sodium/Glucose co transporter, water follows Sodium). The food part, I really have no idea how to explain that one. Has to be light or else you get sicker. I read somewhere that amino acids help to replenish neurotransmitters, but who knows if it's even true, maybe I'm just a glutton.

Trust me, I'm the doctor."

"Castor oil. Before going to bed, spread it on your chest/stomach over your liver (right side, below your nipple). Our naturopath turned us on to it. I have no idea how, but it works.

It'll eliminate the mild hangovers and knock the really bad one's back to a mild."
Drink a bottle or glass of water after each alcoholic drink. Having Gatorade at the end also helps.  The next day: lot's of water, a banana and try to go light on the coffee. It is a bit too acidic for me the day after drinking. 
"Lots of water before you pass out, of hair of the dog the next morning. I like to have a drunk or two in the am to get me feeling right again. Bloody Mary's go down the easiest or me when I'm hungover.

"I don't let them happen. I drink as much water as I can before falling asleep drunk. 
Currently at work on new years day and I feel great. "
"Here's something I do on the front end:

After a long night of drinking, I'll eat a shitload of ice cream.

It usually is the final touch to making me pass out and I'm typically hangover free in the morning.  

Two warnings:

1) If you are super drunk and believe there's a chance you are going to vomit - do the vomiting and THEN ice cream.  

2) It tends to make me very poopy the next day.  So it's somewhat of a trade-off."
"Water.  Lots of it.  If you have the presence of mind, drink it before you go to sleep.  Leave a liter bottle by your bed before you go out.  If you forget to drink it before sleep, drink as much of it as you can the first time you wake up and feel like shit.  Drink more every time you wake up.  Don't forget to piss.

I was taught this by a functional alcoholic from Manchester.  It actually works."
"I have several cures, but these have been developed and catered to my body and alcohol intake.

Most likely when I'm drunk, I drink a lot of beer. I'm talking like 20-30+ (American beers, whatever). Anyway, I obviously urinate a lot, so I'm very dehydrated. I don't often get upset stomachs with my hangovers. Usually my hangovers are akin to a severe migraine with a little bit of an upset stomach. 

The number one way I deal with a hangover is to avoid it. I try to drink water before going to sleep, and at least eat a little bit of food, usually high in protein or salt. 

If you've woken up and you're hungover, determine your level of nausea. If you're feeling like you're gonna throw up, go do it. It'll empty your stomach, and almost every time will reduce any nausea you have to nearly none. If you don't have to throw up or you've already done so, start drinking water. Don't gulp it, don't drink a crapton. Aim for a glass every half hour or so. 

I typically will have a vitamin water or energy drink the next day to get a bunch of vitamin B and C into my system. If my headache is extremely severe, I'll take ibuprofen or aspirin, or acetaminophen. Most people will tell you those are bad for your liver and stomach if you've been drinking and that may be true. I've never experienced any bad side effects as a result of taking that medication while being drunk or hungover. 

Eat some food. Anything high in protein and salt. Jack in the Box breakfast menu is great if you enjoy greasy foods. If not, I think I saw someone mention eating Chicken Noodle soup. That's a wonderful idea and I highly recommend/back it up. Alternately, eating scrambled or fried eggs, with some toast and orange juice is never a bad idea. 

Allowing your body to rest is important, and after you've taken a shit and peed (if you feel you need to), then showered and eaten a I would say keep a glass of water near your bed, darken your room, and go back to sleep if you can.

Hope this helps, if you have any specific questions feel free to ask. 

Edit: Stoners, if you smoke some weed before you sleep you'll usually avoid a hangover, especially if you've drank some water and eaten some food. If you wake up hungover, smoke some weed and go back to bed after making a bowel movement, showering and eating. Weed is a great anti-hangover, and don't let anyone tell you different. "
I have never been hungover, but I'm sure I'd have a bloody mary and pizza the next day. I also like to make excuses to drink a bloody mary.
"Subway; 12 inch meatball marinara on hearty Italian bread. No salad (food's food) or sauces. Job's a good'n

Or if I'm with a friend who can drive, big daddy box mean from subway. The burger is enough to fix me, the rest is for fun.

Also, as a preventative (e.g. when I'm not pass out drunk) two pints of water before bed and no hangover."
Pre-emptively cure a hangover by drinking a glass of water between every drink. Not only does it reduce the rate at which you get drunk if you want to avoid that (If you still wanna get drunk, just have bigger glasses of alcohol :D) but you also feel remarkably well the next morning.
Greasy fried potatoes and Gatorade - potatoes help with the stomach acid and Gatorade replaces electrolytes. 
This'll get buried, but either; hair of the dog or a big greasy breakfast. My favourite is a double Bondi burger meal from Oportos. I feel like a new man after a big hangover breakfast.
Bubbly water with salt and lemon juice. They actually sell them at my high school after big parties that happen during the week so the kids can focus on class and not the head ache.
I have found a couple of Berocca before I go out and a couple when I get home seems to help also a good supply of anti nausients in case things get out of hand. A med student also told me that the enzyme that processes alcohol also processes paracetamol so its best not to have this when drinking stick to ibuprofen if needed.
"Wired Magazine said that apparently a tablespoon of chunky peanutbutter stirred into a bowl of instant oatmeal will do the trick.

I've had varying success with this method."
"Hangover ""cures"" are myths.  You have to circumvent it before it ever happens to begin with.  2 simple rules:

1. The clearer the alcohol is, the less hangover you will have due to the increased compounds found in colored alcohols from wood aging and natural tannins and what-not, thus the less your liver has to filter out on top of processing the alcohol.

2. Drink a full glass of water between every drink you have, then drink as much water as you can before passing out."
"Step 1: Puke if you have to. Chug 1 vita coco with 1 vitamin B supplement. Hydrate all day.

Step 2: Bong

Step 3: Nap

Step 4: Cold shower (better, jump into a cold body of water, shock your system.)

Step 5: BLT with mayo.

Step 6: Physical activity.

Step 7: Drink a beer. 

Edit: also, poop."
My mom gave her brother a big glass of lemonade with a tablespoon of baking soda. Barfed away the hangover.

Finally. It sucks but you must have a plan or you'll be miserable. Trying to fix yourself the morning of just doesn't work."
I'm late to this, and it may have already been said, but bacon sandwich and water. Rehydrating, lots of fat, amino acids, protein, some carbs, and because bacon. 
Pedialyte works really well. If none is on hand, I generally chug all the water I can before bed, when I undoubtedly wake up to pee, I chug more and go back to sleep. Rinse and repeat. 
"Everyone is saying greasy salty foods and salted water/gatorade.

Thanks to science.. the actual answer is: [Asparagus!](http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/home/scientists-asparagus-ward-hangover.htm). Its been scientifically proven. Click the link from how stuff works to read why!
"16 oz. 100% cranberry juice (available at Trader Joe's and elsewhere) mixed with 48 oz. of water.  Compounds in the cranberry juice support your liver's cytochrome p450 detoxification pathways and the fluid volume helps flush toxins out of your system and rehydrate you.

Also, lots of sleep."
There's no *trick* to it, it's science. What you need is lots of protein, carbohydrates, salt, water and plain old calories (some paracetamol may also help). So a bacon sandwich and a few glasses of water should fix it right up
I had to drink Ensure when I got my gallbladder out and realized that drinking one or two cures a hangover in about an hour. Also, they are delicious and have a horrible rap.
I have no idea how to get rid of a hangover when I have one but I know that if I sober up before falling asleep I won't wake up hungover at all.
Drink 2 full cups of water before bed has worked. Gotten almost blackout drunk but made sure I drank a big glass of room temp water. the Big thing is to prevent the coming dehydration.
When you're having a level 10 hangover, as in the thought of dry toast makes you want to throw up, I've found that the combination of applesauce and ice pops is a great way of fooling your stomach back into functioning.
"Best way to get rid of a hang over is to make sure it doesnt happen.

On nights I am going to drink heavily, before I go to bed I ensure I drink a 1 litre of gatorade/powerade/r sports drink, two extra stength tylenol and I make sure I get food in me before bed.

Now if your at the point of being black out puke drunk, this will not help you as chance as you are gonna spew it up anyways."
Stay young. No, seriously a mars bar and a Klix chicken soup works, but only if there isn't a full Scottish breakfast in the immediate vicinity. 
My method is a vitamin B complex before drinking and after. Then, before bed eat a some Chinese food (generally, Chinese food is high in sodium) with a large gatorade or water. 
The best way to get rid of a hangover to me is to drink another beer after drinking a couple of cups of water. Drink the beer slowly and savor the flavor as if it was your last beer and youll notice that it will start to wear off.
"This is a rip the band-aid off trick. It sucks bad and makes my head feel like it's about to explode, but you'll feel 100% not hungover afterwards. 

**Go run/walk a couple miles.**

I've tried this a couple of times, though it's not for the faint of heart. The first half mile to 3/4 mile, my body is screaming ""fuck you!"". Then I start sweating and tricking the body to start consuming more water. Then by the end of it, I'm back to normal. If you want to take 20 minutes of throwing up and having a throbbing headache from hell vs being hungover most of the day, this is a good trick. It's like compressing your all day hangover to 20 minutes."
Well, I didn't see this posted in the first 100 comments, but coconut water.  It can even be used intravenously for blood loss if no blood is available.  
Every time I have a hangover, I grab my friends and we go get pho. That shit cures my headache, dehydration, and hunger immediately. 
For me, it's all about the night before. A LOT of water and some advil/ tylenol/ motren before bed and I feel fine the next morning.
get two jars of peanut butter put it in your hair. put 4 limes on your eyes open or close. then sing four lion king songs. with wights on your chest. 
As an ex bartender with 12 years experience and a self proclaimed ex party-girl, Chicken bouillon is really the best thing that will help. Dissolve one or two of the cubes in a cup of boiling hot water and you'll be on to solid foods in no time. I have prescribed this remedy to many friends and have not heard a complaint as of yet. 
I go and get the greasiest bacon burger I can find and wash it down with as much Powerade as I can handle. Works every time.
It's the last thing I ever want to do when I'm hungover, but going for a run or any other aerobic exercise works a dream. And huge amounts of water.
Sauerkraut soup!! It's tradition in my (Slovak) family to eat sauerkraut soup on the first of the year mostly because it cures hangovers!
Provided I don't have to be anywhere that I have to drive 1-2 shots of peppermint schnapps and I'm golden the rest of the day
This thread got real scientific, I usually just get some greasy ass food and coffee. It just works for me. It really shouldn't though...
"Brush your teeth.

Drink as many glasses of water as you possibly can before going to sleep.

Once you wake up, don't immediately get out of bed, lay there for 15-30 minutes and embrace the shame spiral of the previous night.

Make bacon and toast, dip/soak the toast in the bacon grease (I know OT sounds disgusting but it's fuckin awesome)"
"Before you pass out: A vitamin C tablet and a couple glasses of water. 
In the morning: More water and a bacon sarnie"
I have heard that you should drink 3 glasses of water after drinking & you won't be hungover in the morning.
"I usually just take a Vitamin B-Complex, drink a ton of H20 and a bottle of gatorade. Feel better in no time.

Throwing up doesn't hurt either."
"I usually tackle it on the front-end. If I'm not too smashed and I retain enough fine motor skills and awareness I down two (2) bottles of water along with two (2) BC Powders right before I lay down. 

I don't know if the aspirin adds anything but goddamn that placebo effect is something nice as your head hits the pillow."
"5 things you should do, and this is assuming you are a healthy adult with no underlying medical conditions.  Again, I'm not a doctor so take this advice with a grain of salt.  It has worked for me.

1.  Stop drinking at least an hour before you want to sleep.

2. drink as much water as you can.  At least a liter.  Yes, I know this is a lot.  Do it anyway.

3. Eat at least one piece of whole grain bread.  Nothing on it, not toasted, nothing done to it.  Just eat the damn thing like I said.  And don't give me that ""gluten intolerant"" bullshit.  You're not, you just want to be so you can be special.  Talk to someone who actually has Celiac Disease and you'll understand you're full of shit and probably just getting too much insoluble fiber in your diet, not gluten intolerant.

4. Take one aspirin.  Not two, not four, just one.  No acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, just one regular asprin.  

5. Before you go to sleep, empty your bladder and bowels as best as you can.  Turn on the faucet, whatever you have to do to relieve your bladder and bowels of as much as you can before you go to sleep.  Your less likely to wake up prematurely.  Sleep is a big part of what you need right now."
"Prevention is key. At least one glass of water, or a watered down electrolyte based drink. Pedialyte, or generic versions are the best by far. Also, eat something with protein.

For your head in the morning, mix caffeine and ibuprofen. Hangover headache goes away within a half hour. The combination prevents your brain from producing aldehyde (which is what the alcohol breaks down into and hurts your noggin).

Alka seltzer for the stomach.

"
Water. If you don't pass out beforehand have a couple of glasses of water before bed, as many as you can have without throwing up, 2-3 glasses. And/or have a glass of water after a couple drinks. It's worked for me every-time.
"Water and sleep and more water.

What I heard was hangovers are often caused by dehydration, so your body starts taking up water from alternate water sources around your body. One of the places it takes water from is the brain, and so much so that your brain shrinks in size. The headache is often caused by the ligaments (or whatever the brain ones are called) being put under a lot of tension when the brain size shrinks.  

That's the same reason you often get throats and chapped lips after drinking.

source: I watch a youtube video 2 years ago.   "
"No trick to cure, but I find if I have a couple handful of almonds before drinking I won't get a hangover.

"
There was a TIL about this awhile ago, maybe I can find the link.  Anyway, it said a bacon sandwich is the best way to cure a hangover. I don't exactly know if it works, I only skimmed through it and read bits and pieces.
So, this is going to get buried but I swear it works. Tall glass of water + emergenC + alka selzter (with aspirin) then, load in some eye drops. Saves, lives.
"two things

Either puke before going to bed, or drink like a Litre of water and eat som salt before going to bed.

Or you can just continue to drink alcohol.
"
"Grease. Lots and lots of grease. Bacon, eggs, sausages, gravy, chips, 'sall good.

Or never stop drinking, that works too."
"Taking Activated Charcoal before going to sleep.

It will absorb the excess alcohol for your stomach, and your body will only have to process the booze that already got you drunk, which will be done by the time you wake up, even if you wake up 3 hours later.

You'll still enjoy the post-drinking breakfast like crazy, but you won't have the other effects.

Depending on your digestive motility, you may still have the beer-shits at some point, but it's a small price to pay."
Drink as much water/eat loads before bed, go to bed, wake up about 3-5 hours later, more water, 2 ibruprofen, back to sleep until you feel like you can move again.
A box of coconut water and 2 cans of Chef Boyardee beef ravioli. It must be done in that order exactly. There are grave consequences for fucking the order of consumption up. 
"Mild Hangover: bloody marys
Moderate: Bacon sarnie - or sandwich to my american brethren (crispy streaky bacon and ketchup on brown bread)
Oh-jesus-I'm-dying: Pho noodle soup, or rice porridge (japanese style)
I'm still drunk: Fried spicy thick noodles (mee goreng)"
BACON SANDWICH!!! No seriously, the carbohydrates in the bread, and the protein and salt in the bacon help replenish electrolytes and make you feel good. Please note, this works best before you sleep and after you wake up, and don't forget to drink water.
I keep a cold perrier in the fridge. Since medicines and booze dont mix i just sleep off being drunk. When i wake up early in the mor.ing feelig like crap i puke if i have to then i drink the club soda  with aspirin and go back to sleep. I feel fine afterwards. People hate fizzy water for whatever reason taste,fizz idk but its a fact that carbonated water hydrates you faster than regular water
If you're sober enough to do it, right before you think you're going to pass out or go to bed, take a Gaviscon, 2 Aleve/Ibuprofen, drink a glass of water, and eat a piece of bread. Always works 
A banana (for scale(seriously though)) and like 1/3 OJ and water. Saved me this morning from what would be a brutal hangover.
"Drink as much water as possible. I usually wake up and try to drink 3 pints back to back.  

After consuming a shit ton of water, smoke a bowl and go back to sleep for an hour or two.

If you're still hurting bad, drink another 2-3 pints of water (if you have gatorade, a bottle of that is gold).  Eat something balanced, not fried (it may taste great but your stomach will probably regret it).  I like rice, beans, avocado, and salsa. Salty potatoes are also your friend.

If all else fails, do everything you can to drink a beer.  It may be awful, but power through it. Then drink another.  Eventually, the slight buzz will outweigh the hangover.  Then resume drinking copious amounts of water."
Never tried it, but my friend swares it works. Before you pass out, chug a cup of water and have another cup by your sleeping arrangements. You will wake up to piss later. Chug the cup there and eat a banana. Once you wake up again you'll be good as new 
"Lots of water, good food and weed. 

I woke up from a wicked champagne hangover and this made me feel much better. "
"Not really a cure but more a preventative measure.
MILK THISTLE.
Take one capsule right before you go to sleep (assuming you remember and not throw any of it up). The next morning you'll be great and not feel the affects of the night before.
This is tried and tested many a times... and many of our friends are believers in the thistle. 
However,word of warning: sitting on the toilet is much better than kneeling in front of it."
Milk. Any kind, cow, almond, soy etc. I sounds like the absolute worst thing you've ever thought of when you're hungover, but it works in about 20 minutes. Without fail. 
"Pedialyte cures the hangover, but a table spoon of olive oil before you start drinking prevents the hangover. ;)
"
Curing is all about what u do the night before. chug a bottle of gatorade the night before and take two ibuprofens. you'll wake up feeling great. If it doesn't work go to McD's and buy some chicken nuggets and a $1 large coke
So I've read that back in WWII, when blood plasma was low in the Pacific Theatre, the Allied Forces would use Coconut water as a substitute. Since its makeup is very similar to blood plasma, and since it's sterile, you can use it intravenously. It's very rich in vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. Apparently, one cup of coconut water has like 12 times as much potassium as an entire gatorade. I've never tried coconut water intravenously, but it is safe. I love to drink it. And I've cured a hangover with a can of it. It's delicious. But I heard that an IV drip of saline is the best cure.
"My hangover routine is to pop 2 ibuprofen, and chug a glass of water. Pools and showers are great because your skin absorbs water really fast, and it is a great way to hydrate through something besides your digestive tract. Also, and this won't be for everyone, but I like to smoke a bowl after my shower/swim to top it all off. That takes away my nausea, and increases my appetite which allows to me eat right away and not have to worry about keeping it down.

Also, drink a glass of water before you go to bed. If you are super drunk, it might be a good idea to make yourself throw up before sleeping. This expels the toxins that your body would be absorbing while you sleep, and reduces the danger of throwing up in your sleep. 

If you have to wake up and do something the next day (work, school, etc.), it is wise to set your alarms earlier than you need to get up so that you have time to refresh and get your system back on track before you have to go about your day.

I also like multi-vitamins. They definitely make a difference with hangovers if you take one everyday, hangover or not.

Hope this helps somebody!"
More beer, I'm not even lying, try it next time you get a hangover, it lifts yo from the pain and despair and wakes you up.
"Several hangover tips I've confirmed over the years:

Strawberries _before_ drinking leads to big reduction or elimination of stomach symptoms.

As everyone knows, fluids before bed (especially something like a full bottle of Gatorade) help a ton, but these prevention methods don't always happen when you're super wasted.

Green Tea extract pills (easy to find in the vitamin section of a pharmacy) + Aspirin (or ibuprofen) can help quite a bit in the morning.

A multivitamin before/during/after drinking helps as well.

Small, varied, nutritious meals to get your metabolism going gets your system back to normal faster.

All these and a nice, long hot shower can usually get you through the day.

IV Fluids & prescription anti-nausea pills are the only real morning insta-cures I've found, but for those outside the medical profession these can be hard to get."
"I told my friend milk helped if he drank it before he went to bed. I laughed because I was told milk was bad if you were already drunk. Turns out nothing happened and he was fine. My plan was foiled.
"
"Depends, on what gave you the hangover.  Your choice of drink will greatly affect the intensity and nature of the hangover.  When choosing liquor, remember that the distilling process affects the purity of the alcohol.  Virtually all distilling involves the introduction of yeast.

Unfortunately, yeast is a very common and varied element and is present in the air all around us.  There's all kinds of yeast, and different kinds of yeast yield different variations of alcohol. 

The more sophisticated distilling techniques introduce the ""right"" kind of yeast while keeping the ""wrong"" kind of yeast (Usually floating in the air all around us) out of the process.

Drinking cheap liquors, (Cheap blended whiskey comes to mind) can produce horrendous mornings, not entirely because of the amount you drank, but the impurities in the alcohol.  

On the other hand, drinking the same amount of high end vodka's, or single malt scotches produces a much less intense morning experience.  

So here's the deal, if you spend the evening ordering ""Whiskey Sours"" or other named drinks without calling the brand, you're getting the rail brand and if you tie one on, you're screwed.

So what brands should you order?  It's not that simple, everyone's physiology is different and the liquors affect people differently.

For example, Patron Tequila gives me immediate headaches the next day, but most folks consider this high end.  

You don't have to buy top shelf, but you should find a liquor you can drink straight on the rocks and assess it yourself the next day.  Bottom shelf liquor is OK if you're only having a drink or two.  More than that, I'd seriously reconsider dancing with that bottle of ""Old Crow"".  

It's another case of ""you get what you pay for"".  When you go to the liquor store, steer away from the cheapest (bottom shelf), stay on mid-grade or higher.


"
The best (But most likely bad for your body long term) is Cold/Flu medication with Pseudoephedrine in it. Especially if it also contains pain killers like Codeine and/or Ibuprofen. It will cure a hangover as the pain will be gone and the Pseudoephedrine clears the head/nose and gives you an energy boost.
"Drink only whisky with ginger ale. Seems the only thing I never get a hangover from.

Seriously though, some OJ and/or water in the morning."
Steak, eggs, and watered down Gatorade. Rehydrates, replenishes salt, and the protein does something. Had it this morning worked great 
"Decided to join after months of lurking ... 


My rules which I swear by.

1) For every 1 alcoholic drink you have, be it a pint or shot, drink 1 or 2 huge gulps of water. This keeps you hydrated yet still keep the buzz going ... however you'll piss like a race horse through out the night.
On a side note : I once drank a bottle of rum over the space of a night and had half a glass of water after every shot. The only buzz I had could be compared to a sugar rush. No need for the following hang over cures.

2) If you are trashed and you want to just sleep DONT. Drink a pint of water and keep yourself occupied, stick on the TV, play PS3 or XBOX to keep your self busy.
At the point you start to feel a headache coming on drink another pint of water, then hit the sack.
You are effectively sleeping through the hangover (not waking up to one), which I've found comes on quicker if you stay awake, a couple of hours after you stop drinking.

3) 6+ hours later you'll wake up feeling a bit dizzy and slightly groggy BUT no/minimal headache and vomiting feelings, slam a paracetamol down your throat along with a multi vitamin tablet regardless.

4) many people drink Gatorade or lucazade ... DONT. This is full of sugars you'll feel OK for an hour, but when youre sugars crash you'll feel like crap. Drink something with electrolytes but that has no/minimal sugar. diarrhea medication is full of electrolytes, its safe to have even if you don't have diarrhea, the medication comes in powdered form in satchets which you have to mix in water.



works for me every time and I don't even have to have a greasy fatty breakfast that society (in the UK) suggests !
"
"sleep. On top of what t0aster says...alcohol reduces the effectiveness of your sleep so sleep off your hangover.
I also heard/read that chemicals in cooked eggs can reduce a hangover but can make it worse unless consumed with vitamin C.
Egg in a cup with some tomatoes (& plenty of salt) and a big drink of water before and after lots of sleep = no hangover or a mild one at worst.

I come from a Mexican family so if available, we eat menudo [yeah it's that nasty cow stomach soup] and it 'cures' it in less than an hour.
i drink a metric fuckload of coconut water, then have something with bacon and eggs. if you smoke bud, it also helps a ton. Usually my hangovers suck most because they're coupled with sleep deprivation. nothing worse than waking up at 7 am after passing out piss drunk at 4. Smoking a small joint puts me right back to sleep for however long i need, to the point that when i finally wake up *again*, my hangover's gone or almost gone. 
"Bacon and bread work really well, along with other foods that provide fat, salts and carbohydrates.  Also drink water, and avoid things that dehydrate you like coffee or more alcohol.  

For me the most common method is to drink water between shots or glasses, and have something like bacon ready when I wake up."
I get home, drink 5 glasses of water, make myself some food. If I do wake up with a headache, I whine for a while and moan, tell myself I'll deal with it naturally and then give up after 30 minutes and take advils.
"Avoid hangovers, stay drunk. 

Seriously, if possible, have a couple drinks in the morning just enough to get buzzed."
"Sports drinks and protein always do the trick for me. Gatorade was ok, but vitamin water, especially the coconut water variation really work pretty quick when combined with a bacon, egg and cheese, or some sauage and egg on a croissant.

Arizone made a great drink  called Recovery Something that contained green tea, electrolytes, and milk thistle. It helped me with the absolute worst mornings, but I think its discontinued. I havent seen it anywhere in a long time."
Chicken flavored top ramen. Add a slice of velveeta cheese and a few drops of tapitio. I have that with a big ass glass of iced tea.  After that I'm pretty much right as rain.
"The best cure for a hangover is 8OZ of cold pickle juice followed by a Hersey's chocolate milkshake drink 30 mins or so after you down the pickle juice. try it before you knock it. 

ALOT of people are saying bacon and its because of the SALT in it that for some reason helps. Pickle juice is 1000X better than bacon. Im telling you people try it the next time you feel like you have been hit by a truck."
Charcoal Pills. I take between 2-4 (depending on how much I drink) before going to bed (wasted me is pretty responsible) and I wake up with no hangover. No pills and its exorcist reenactments and a lovely migraine for the next 24 hours. I shit you not these pills are amazing. You can find them at any vitamin supplier!
kill some Gatorade before passing out after a long night of drinking. if you wake up hung over, drink some more motherfucking Gatorade because that shit is life saving. 
Hot and sour soup. Coconut water (It's easier to drink if it's flavored). Some phenergan and the better part of a day asleep. 
"If you can get a hold of liquid oxygen... =D

But on those days you are just too tired to walk into the lab and pour yourself a cup:

1. Water (before and after bed)
2. Sleep
3. Exercise - if you can physically get out of the house and go for a run, it will feel like shit for the first minute, and then work wonders.  "
Become an alcoholic like me, I drink half a bottle of whiskey a night, stay up till 3, and then wake up at 7:30 for class and work. After a while your body gets used to it, and the mornings that suck are the mornings after nights where you didn't drink.

"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_VPXdGa2qM Household Hackers. It's a video on how to ""hack"" a hangover. Thank me later."
"Here are some tips I've found useful:   
1. If you feel nauseous, puke. Get it out of the way, you'll feel better.  
2. Take a headache tablet. Do NOT TAKE PARACETAMOL! Paracetamol is broken down along the same metabolic pathways as alcohol, it will only make you feel worse. Instead, take aspirin or ibuprofen or, even better, codeine.   
3. Have a long, hot shower. At the end of it, turn it down to cool (not painfully cold, mind you). The hot shower opens your pores and washes away all the sticky gunk, the cold shower closes them so you won't sweat after you get out of the shower.  
4. This is going to seem gross, but please try it anyway: Have some yoghurt. This works for two reasons: Milk is soothing to the stomach, and the yoghurt culture helps restore the bacteria balance you've upset by pouring poison into yourself. Any old yoghurt will do, you don't need the fancy 'bioactive' ones that come in tiny bottles.  
5. Go back to  bed until you feel better - you're not doing anybody any good in the state you're in. Sleep if you can."
stay hydrated throughout the day, especially if you're planning on drinking a lot that night. try to balance a glass of water with each drink. chug gatorade before going to bed. i always stick with vodka and diet soda. no sugar, so less of a chance of feeling sick.

The one thing I found that helps the most is a big breakfast.  My usual approach is bacon and eggs, and V8.  It works in two ways; one, the bacon and eggs provide lots of fat and protein to rebuild any damage you've done to your body.  I also find the bacon and V8, in particular, helps settle the stomach.

The other way is that all of these things are salty (well, the eggs only if you add salt) (V8 original, not that low sodium bullshit).  I've found that drinking a lot of water really quickly with a hangover can be really unpleasant, almost like my body doesn't want it.  However, if you're eating really salty foods, it gets really easy to slam down a few glasses of water really quickly."

If you have nothing else to do that day, hair-of-the-dog is always a good option. Alcohol in the morning suppresses the hangover and when in something like a strong spicy Bloody Mary it will work wonders. The trouble is that if the first one doesn't work, you have to carry on drinking until it gets back to where you were before, and then tomorrow could potentially be double as bad.

I'm impressed that you could type all this out and even concentrate while being very hung over.  Excellent info here!
Great post. I wish you could tell me why I feel like shit after a long night of being sober though :(
Yep, the soup works great, especially if it's kind of chunky. Beef works in the soup as well (a thick stew may not stay down though), but chicken and other poultry are cheaper. I have personally used this method before with good results, but if you want to speed things up (and if your stomach can take it), have some coffee or an energy drink with it. A lot of people take over the counter pain meds, and while they will work to a point, it should go without saying that a hangover is not your typical headache. Salt and fluids need to be replenished for the pain to stop.
"To be more specific about the second part:

Your liver can break down just about all the alcohol you drink.  Great. Except one of the components it breaks down into is aldehyde, something pretty poisonous.  To make matters worse, your liver doesn't have very much of the enzyme that breaks down aldehyde, so when you drink too much, all of it gets used up, and you're left with a bunch of poison in your body.  This is why drinking too much destroys your liver, and why (aside from dehydration) you get hung over."
"This is a great explanation but I must add a few things:

Your body has two pathways to metabolize acetaldehyde. There is an enzyme to catalyze the process called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Levels are reduced for women, men as they age, and frequent drinkers. Hence hangovers tending to get worse over the years.

The other way is through reducing the acetaldehyde. This is normally done by glutathione within the liver. The reason vitamins work is because some (like C) are potent antioxidants. I have a colleague who drinks harder than a college kid in his 40s who takes nothing but a gram of C. Also, there are precursors to glutathione (amino acids and vitamins) which theoretically would give more resources to produce.

The thing is, most people are looking for salvation the morning after. By then the damage has been done. Acetaldehyde has been pickling your liver for hours, your vitamins/minerals are depleted and you probably had a shitty night's sleep. You need to take something before bed to have any hope of waking up fresh.

I won a business plan based around a formula to be taken before bed for hangovers which consisted of B1, B6, B12, C, Magnesium, N-acetyl Cysteine, l-alanyl-glutamine and Prickly Pear extract. Not really pursuing it at the moment but it's what I use every time I drink. I also try to eat a meal, drink a big glass of water and take a shot of pickle juice for electrolytes. Long list I know but any of those are better than nothing.

Cheers!

It's worth noting that there are other impurities in alcoholic beverages that can also have toxic effects.  Methanol, for example, which metabolizes into formaldehyde, and also fusel oils, although the effects of these are debateable.  Drinking clear and/or higher quality alcohol can mitigate some of these effects as there is a higher ethanol/impurity ratio.  [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangover)

">Hot chicken noodle soup. Replenishes salt and fluids while the warmth settles your stomach. The noodles are easy to digest, and the protein in chicken chunks may help replenish the substrates that run the aldehyde dehydrogenase. I usually salt the soup a bit heavier, and eat with a piece of bread to help make the soup last longer in the stomach.

Thank you so much for this advice. I myself am not hungover, however a friend of mine a few states over texted me saying she's working over a bad hangover. I told her to have some chicken noodle soup and at first she said she wasn't hungry, but about 30 minutes later she texted me saying it was really helping.

You left out the most important part: it fucks up your sleep. Try sleeping 2 hours a night some day, it will feel _exactly_ like a hangover: enervated, bad mood. Therefore, the best hangover cure is: sleep as long as you can, pee, drink, take a sleeping pill, sleep even more. After like 12 hours of total sleep it should be OK.

Pedialyte is just gatorade for kids. You can make your own by adding a tsp of salt and 1 tsp of baking soda to a quart of Kool-aid. I personally like to throw  a few dashes of salt in a glass of grapefruit juice, it tastes good and is like a magic potion against hang overs.

"It does nothing to the alcohol in your stomach - it's just that most of the negative consequences of a hangover are due to dehydration and loss of minerals from your body (drinking causes excessive urination, which dehydrates you and robs your body of salts).

Drinking water before you sleep (obviously) helps to correct the dehydration while you're still unconscious, and putting a little salt in it both helps the body to absorb it more efficiently and replaces some of the salts you lost while drunkenly pissing like a racehorse the previous night.

If you really want to avoid a hangover:

* Eat something before you go out (""line the stomach"") so that the stomach closes off for prolonged digestion and digests the alcohol more slowly, giving your body time to mop up earlier booze before the later drinks get digested.  If you don't have time to eat, try a glass of milk as the fats in the milk also cause the same delayed digestion.

* Stop drinking a couple of hours before you sleep, so you still enjoy your drunkenness but don't stick even more poisons in your body that you're going to miss the benefit of because you're unconscious (also delaying your hangover by a few hours), and instead give your body a head-start on your hangover, so by the time you wake up it's a couple of hours less severe than it would have been.

* Drink a pint of water before you go to bed (salt optional, but not a bad idea), or some other isotonic/mineral-rich drink like gatorade, to replace lot fluids and salts.

* Eat a big, greasy, protein-rich breakfast (fry-ups are perfect for this) to mop up any remaining alcohol lurking in your stomach, replace more salts and give your stomach something it can quickly digest to give you some quick energy to get you back on track for the day.  I don't know any particular chemical/biological justification behind this last point, but a couple of decades of anecdotal evidence indicate it's a damn good idea. ;-)"
Your science teacher probably has an army of people drinking salt + pepper water before they go to bed wasted. What a fucking genius. 
Pepper does nothing, all you are doing is hydrating and replacing the salt lost while drinking. You could also drink Gatorade.
I've heard something very similar. However, instead of pepper, you put a pinch of sugar. It's supposed to help rehydrate you better. I have found that the best way to prevent a hangover is to chug a 20oz Gatorade right before you go to bed.  The electrolytes prevent headaches, ease any nausea, and rehydrate you. You'll wake up feeling like a million bucks. The salt-water-sugar combo is just a cheap version of Gatorade.
There is nothing fancy going on. The water helps keeps you hydrated. That's the only benefit from it.
"There's an old story of a doctor who had a patient who presented with chronic headaches. In the end the doctor prescribed aspirin three times a day, each dose to be taken with two large glasses of water.

Miraculously the patient's headaches cleared, because there was nothing wrong with him apart from being dehydrated and too fucking stupid to just drink water despite being told he was dehydrated."
"A hangover is dehydration.  Water won't make you less drunk but it will prevent the dehydration.

Other than that, you simply have to wait for your body to process the toxin over time.  I believe higher metabolism rates will speed this up a little bit, but the liver can really only work so fast."
I was going to write this down for next time I'm drinking, and then I remembered that I'm allergic as fuck to black pepper... Any alternatives?
or you can have the same effect by drinking about the same amount of gatorade, powerade, coconut water, etc.
"Hangovers are caused by the dehydration due to excessive alcohol consumption. Drink 2 or 3 glasses of water before going to bed (or alternate 1 alcoholic drink and a glass of water, but who the fuck wants to do that?) and you'll feel much better when you wake up. Drink plenty of water the day after as well.

PS don't take tylenol (acetaminophen) to help your headache. The way your body processes the drug while alcohol is present in your liver causes it to metabolize into a poison, and can be very dangerous. The thinking is in the morning there could very well be alcohol left in your body, so I wouldn't risk it."

NOTE: Was going to link the youtube clip, but they took it down. You'll have to just get the reference."
I had a chemistry teacher named Mr. Stewart that I could see giving hangover cure tips.... city/state?
All this is well if you know you have got durnk enough. I can not judge that and always pass out after being drunk excessively, so its about 3-4 straight drinks in the last hour before I manage to hit the bed.
"Seconded.

Now, if only I lived near an ocean, and in a climate where it's not fucking freezing this time of the year. But during holidays, this is amazing."
"Agreed. This is what I said in my comment. Any physical activity while hungover will cure it. I used to have early Saturday practices for lacrosse, and we'd get plastered the night before, but having to wake up at 7 AM, and run around a field for 3 hours gets your body working right again.

It sucks, but it's the most effective way in my opinion."
I have never had a hangover (under 21) but can't the massive headache or pain or whatever happens make that dangerous?
In the summer, the first thing I do when I wake up after a night of drinking is go soak in the pool. In the winter I might take a cool shower. Drinking makes me overheat like crazy. Once I get my body temp down I usually feel fine.
I don't know what it is: refreshing temperature? salt? water? mild exercise? but this right here is the best. Follow it with a bloody mary and a ton of water and you are pretty much human again. 
"Unless the waves are very strong that day and you tire yourself out.

Source: Me stealthily puking in a bathroom full of children at the beach the morning after drinking 2 bottles of wine."
I find this incredibly hard to believe. When I am sufficiently hungover, the light emanating from my phone is enough for me to curse the name of Apollo. Going out into the sunlight, in heat, while attempting to not drown is the last goddamn thing on Earth I would want to do. 
Gatorade, marijuana, heroin.  To be followed by bacon and eggs, with buttered toast/English muffin/bagel.  If you have these items at your disposal, you will never suffer a hangover.  But usually because you don't get drunk that often when you are addicted to heroin.
"If you're in the northern hemisphere Marmite also works like a charm. Have 4 slices of Marmite on hot toast with lots of butter, wash it down with a strong coffee and you're golden.

He just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich 

And he said..."
I saw Vegemite here in Canada at the supermarket the other day =] Didn't have the balls to try it though
"I had a scheme to tell people that before they go drinking, get one of those big square band-aids and spread a heap of vegemite under it and put it on their skin somewhere. It probably doesn't work, but I was hoping to seek Ice Soap fame.

It's not entirely based on lies and magic, I once saw a machine in a pub bathroom that sold patches like that, as well as condoms. It says they contain a lot of thiamin that your body absorbs while it's worn to combat hangovers. Probably more than a spreading of vegemite."
Vegemite is the single only food item ever to make me... evacuate my stomach... upon consumption. It was a nice restaurant, too.
Nah man vegemite and cheese toastie is where it's at! Fulfills your grease cravings and gives you added b vitamins
I can't believe this isn't on top. Pho fixes everything. Once I peel my ass off the couch during half time, I'm going to Pho Bac to get an $8 bowl of magic. 
Finish the night off with pedialite. Much better than Gatorade. Even better than pedialite is coconut water. I skip the aspirin.
Agree. Prevention is 100% better than cure. I always use straight water, but this guy sounds like he's got his shit together so try the gatorade and aspirin.
Please don't take asprin after drinking heavily.  [Read this](http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/alcohol-and-aspirin-the-risks.html#b).  Mixing alcohol and pain killers is one of the leading, if not THE leading, causes of liver/kidney failure in world.
Taking an aspirin before going to bed isn't going to help at all. The effects will have stopped before you wake up anyways.
Similarly I manage my liquor/water ratio by drinking alcohol at the beginning of the night and dedicating the second half to water alone. That way the buz slowly wears off at the time when parties can get bad and fights or arguments breakout. I personally would rather be more on the alert side at that time of night 
This would be great... Except what about those days you wake up and youre so hungover you can't drink water? This was me on Sunday, and it was the worst/sickest I have ever felt in my life. I got up to take my parents to the airport and thought I was going to die.
I used to do this, but then one time we ran out of soda and I mixed vodka with powerade. Then next thing I know I'm in a coworker's apartament, in bed with another coworker - a chubby girl. Also I puked blue because of said powerade. Never again. 
I had to switch to Smart Water since gatorade/powerade was too sweet for me. But I do the same thing, and works quite well.
Yep, I do this, too.  Have to chug a 32 oz bottle of powerade and sleep with a liter of water next to me, on waking up throughout the night, drink some of the water.
"Don't take aspirin/ibuprofen/acetaminophen while your body is processing alcohol, shit increases the damage to your liver/kidneys.

Drink coconut water instead of gatorade. It's got 10x the electrolytes and 1/10th the calories (roughly)."
I never pop any pills. Not necessary. Just stay hydrated. Also, Gatorade is great, but you need to drink water with it due to high sugar content. 
"I've read plenty times that aspirin and alocohol are a very bad idea : 

'Alcohol can cause medications to become more potent, therefore increasing the risk of harm to the body. Alcohol and aspirin used together can cause stomach bleeding, reduce the body’s ability to form necessary blood clots and increase the potency of alcohol.'

""aspirin significantly lowered the body's ability to break down alcohol in the stomach'"
"Through my extensive research i have found that EmergenC packets work much better then Gatorade or any other ""power"" drink. "
Yeah bad idea with the aspirin. Not only does it increase irritation of your stomach through all kinds of mechanisms, it also inhibits gastric alcohol dehydrogenase and raises alcohol levels. Ibuprofen/Naproxen also bad for your stomach. Tylenol easier on stomach but damages liver, especially while drinking
We call it chasing the hair of the dog. Take another shot or drink a beer, all better... Source - me right now. 
I always sit outside and drink a cider to cure hangovers in the summer, winter hangovers aren't so pleasant.
I often hear that but it's just not true. It dehydrates your body even more causing a harder hangover.
The way you spelled miracle whip and your username leads me to believe we might be best friends In real life. 
Marijuana works especially well if you are nauseous. The joint my roommate rolled me was the only reason I got out of bed the morning after turning 21. 
"I should have read down before insta-posting. *sigh* always slow on the draw... Upvoted yours and my repost in solidarity!

Weed. Best cure ever. No comparison whatsoever."
Weed, hot tea (the hot water hydrates you faster than cool water) and plain, in toasted in buttered bread and a pain killer to help stop the headache asap.
except for hangovers make me jittery and marijuana makes my anxiety skyrocket so then I just full on panic attack and possibly pass out, but yea at least the nausea is gone...
Im staying at my friends log cabin 5 hours from home for New Years. I brought everything i need  except weed (broughtthe wrong container) and now my hangover is a bitch. :(
"Literally this. When someone first told me this I thought it was stoner lore, but then it occurred to me. What do doctor's prescribe chemo patients to deal with the nausea/sickness?



Weed."
"1. Dry mouth, makes you thirsty = drink more fluids to become hydrated
2. Munchies, makes you hungry (and in particular seeking greasy foods, good for hangover recovery)
3. Relieves headache
4. Relieves Nausea

So..... yes"
"The reason I can drink. I used to lay in bed and not eat and feel like shit most times, nowadays we just smoke a bunch and bam, 100%. Still go to the gym, eat right. You name it.

It really is a wonderful medicine"
My friend swears by this. The morning after a long night of drinking she wakes up and smokes a joint with her boyfriend or will smoke a bowl.
"Oh my goodness yes.

Last night I downed 6 shots in 20 minutes (on top of much more) in a rush to get drunk in time for midnight.

My drunk-ass self saved the day and downed a bunch of water, juices, and toked it up before bed.

Only a slight headache this morning. I'd call that a victory."
It is, like, the best medicine. 'Cause it fixes everything. Jonah broke his elbow once. We just... got high and... it still clicks but, I mean, he's ok. 
"For anybody wondering about the effectiveness, I'll summarise:

1) Weed has some really strong anti-nauseous properties. I can vouch for this because my hangovers consist almost purely of stomach-melting nausea, to the point where I can't have a sip of water without chucking up. Few tokes on a joint and I'm emptying the fridge.

2) Is a very effective painkiller, this is great for the headache and the achy bones/joints many people get with a hangover.

3) Often prescribed to people with sleep problems for good reason; weed makes it incredibly easy to drift off and sleep your way through the hangover if you desire.

4) Generally relaxes the body and improves mood, making the day after drinking that much more bearable.

All in all I highly recommend as a hangover cure, but BE CAREFUL IF YOU HAVE NOT USED MARIJUANA BEFORE because it is a mind-altering drug like any other, and if you aren't used to it, you may just end up both hungover and paranoid/anxious/whatever.
"
I find that it's so effective because I wake up around 9 regardless of when I go to bed, so I'm regularly running on a few hours of sleep, and newly awake.  So a bottle of water and a bowl of the Sativa puts me back out until 4pm.  I just sleep on through the worst of it.
Although green and not as good when smoked ..I learned asparagus is scientifically proven to help hangovers...link anyone?
"At least one bottle of water before bed, two advil, sleep and then wake & bake got me through mannnny bad nights.

If you have vicodin, one of those in the morning works wonders too on top of the wait & bake."
I'll have to keep this in mind, I was going to smoke the last time I was hungover but I didn't think it would help.. 
"After scrolling down, I'm surprised there aren't more drug related answers.

In addition to mj, you need to go to your doctor and scam him for these prescriptions.

-Benzodiaz.... I'm too lazy to google how to spell them. My personal favorite for hangover is Valium. (How to get it from a doctor: say that you've had a prescription before and that you only use it as needed. Do not use it all the time. If you ask for refills infrequently, the doctor is more likely to keep giving you the script without questions.)

-Ibuprofen. It works so much better than I feel like it will every time. Taking two with your glass of water before bed helps too.

-Ondansetron. This anti-nausea med is the key to my hangover cure. Plus it sounds like a Transformer so, bonus! I have no idea how to score this. My friend had it for motion sickness but the Internet says it isn't for that. Make friends with someone going through chemotherapy?

Marijuana, blue powerade, and a [mutton pie](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2119/2273344806_d46850a285.jpg).  You've never tasted delicious grease until you've tried real mutton pie. 
man this used to work for me... but now it just makes me paranoid, and coupled with being hungover, I feel like I'm going to die. :(
"Always wanted to try this.... heard it helps so much.

My usual method goes like this.

Wake up.. go ughhhhhh.. puke. Then for the rest of the day rotate between drinking ginger ale and puking. Eventually the ginger ale will conquer the puking and you can try to eat some food. It will probably be like 9 pm by this time and you won't be able to eat much. Then you go to bed and wake up the next day feeling like a champ. Obviously I haven't perfected this yet.."
Am I the only one who's had it made worse?  I just felt hungover and high, it wasn't pleasant at all.
According to National Geographics bit on hangover cures around the world, the Dutch cure is more beer... I think they should replace it with this.
For I am a sinner in the hands of an angry God. Bloody Mary full of vodka, blessed are you among cocktails. Pray for me now and at the hour of my death, which I hope is soon. Amen.
This is how alcoholism starts. You're training your body to need alcohol to get rid of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.
Instead of horseradish I used pepper and squeeze some fresh lime or lemon over it.  Learned this while on vacation with my family in Mexico.
"A bloody Caesar beats a bloody Mary any day, if you ask me. It's a (typically) Canadian take on the  drink that uses Clamato instead of the v8. A little bit saltier and generally more flavorful. Fucking excellent, but hard to find in the US.
Caesar or Mary, though, you're on the right track."
I have had not-a-small-amount of pharmacists and doctors say that while Pedialyte is certainly a good suggestion--and better than water--it doesn't make any difference compared to your Gatorade/Powerade electrolyte sports drink in adults. They kind of put it akin to if someone said you needed vitamins, your first thought is not to go crush a bunch of Flinstone vitamins, you probably pop a Centrum. Gatorade is just as good and much cheaper, but very correct on the rehydrating/electrolyte drink.
"I used to drink a bunch of water the night before (maybe 2 pints) and then drink 2-3 more in the morning with a bunch of ibuprofen and the strongest coffee I coukd make with some breakfast/protein powder mixed in.  It sounds terrible but it was pretty tasty. Promise.

Then this year I tried pedialyte. Worked wonders."
OJ is very acidic and while it seems alluring the morning after it ends up irritating your stomach. If you're like me that means vomit city. I learned the hard way to avoid acidic/citrus drinks the morning after. Threw up an entire lemonade in a bagel place. Such a low point. 
Currently trying to wake up my possibly still drunk boyfriend for this exact reason. Pho is magic soup. 
"That sounds like a horrible routine, as a professional alcoholic listen up:

- chug 4 shots of espresso
- smoke a bowl

- shit/shower/shave
- head to work



This is how I do it, and I usually drink 8-10 drinks a night. MCD's is not what you want, it will just make you feel like more shit."
I make sure to do all these things in any order: drink water, eat food, shower, shit, nap, and orgasm.

I can confirm this. Also if you're in Colorado there is a shop in Lakewood called the house of Windsor that carries all kinds of UK goodies including irn bru :)
Available in the south-east USA through a variety of vendors. Publix (one of the major grocery chains), occasionally Winn-Dixie, and if you look around for small mom & pop international food stores they may have it too.
I always try to make sure I have some in the house so I don't have to wait until I'm feeling well enough to go to the shop to get rid of my hangover.
Have you tried ginger for your upset stomach.  I used keep fresh ginger around for drinking related upset stomach.  You just cut off a piece about the size of a large grape, peel it, and chew it up, and swallow the juice/pulp.  It will burn your mouth a little, but it always made my stomach right as rain in just a few minutes.  Ginger pills may work as well.  I got the idea from an episode of Mythbusters where they discovered that ginger pills were actually the best cure for nausea from sea sickness, and it turned out to work for my hangover nausea too.
See DrunkLuck's post about the smoothie. Although the username would suggest s/he has an ace up his sleeve on this topic...
I do pretty much this same thing, except in addition to the alka-seltzer I ad a packet of EMERGEN-C and instead of coke I do coffee
I think leaving the coke or coffee till last would be a better idea. Drink shitload of water first. From what I've been reading caffiene and sodium rich sodas can rehydrate you, just not as well as plain water. But I think caffiene, once you're rehydrated with water, can make your head feel a lot clearer
Isn't IV fluid just a 0,9 solution of NaCl? Then it's basically water, with a small amount of salt maybe. 
"So what you're saying is the best cure for a hangover is to wake up before it starts and start drinking again. 

I guess I do that every day with weed and my weed hangover so I shouldn't talk."
"I am posting from my toilet as I type to confirm that after 2 bottles of some champagne, some whiskey, and a bit of Valium, drinking a couple pints of water and popping some multivitamins before bed work very well.

edit: (no longer on the toilet) waking up and doing shit as you're still a bit drunk (eating, pounding water) is *faaaar* better than waking up with a dry tongue, slight nausea, and a pounding headache."
Ran a half marathon hungover as fuck. Felt like a boss. Promptly started drinking directly afterwards. 
I strongly disagree with this, I went to the gym once after a heavy weekend, and my heart went out of rhythm.
Nothing about that is odd to me but the snickers bar. does it actually do something, or is it merely delicious?
"Are you a college biology professor or did you hear it from one.

If you did you may have mistaken the sugar for salt."
I'm sorry but it would not be physically possible for me to job in the morning, this sounds like complete shit. I don't think you have any idea what a real hangover feels like. I can barely turn over in bed or walk to the bathroom with out wanting to vomit my brains out.
This would be classified as preventing a hangover not curing it. But everyone else is saying the same thing.
Actually it's best to drink water BEFORE you drink alcohol. Swallow a teaspoon full of salt so that your kidneys will hang on to more water, then down a large glass of water. Many of the bad effects of a hangover are due to dehydration. Prevent dehydration, prevent hangover. 
Yeah you can. Your skin goes all dry. Your body dehydrates rapidly. you have some of the most severe gas ever. Your skin goes all grey and pallid. You wont be able to talk or move. You definitely won't be going to work the next day. Oh hang on, I'm thinking of death. 
"My favorite part is that you don't squash the ""stoner living in the basement"" stereotype with this comment. "
I use water/ibprofuen, but basically the same idea...Ideally I do it the night before, and wake up feeling fine, but I've had sometimes where I forget...I'll wake up miserable, take drink a bottle of water and 2 ibproufen, and I can literally feel the hangover melt away over the next forty-five minutes to an hour as it kicks in...maybe I should switch to aspirin, it will work quicker...
I did this, except I threw in a yogurt for the potassium and then my 2 hours turned to 5 hours. But it worked fairly well. 
"Oh my god, Korean ramen! 

Something about it's spicy soup just unknots that weird sensation in your stomach and clears your head after a night of drinking."
"This is the best reply so far.  I always drink milk before a night of heavy drinking.  Alcohol eats away the lining of your stomach, causing nausea and stomach cramps.  Milk reinforces stomach lining, so you can drink more without feeling sick.  This is especially helpful if you're like me and frequently get sick in the mornings after drinking but don't puke during the evening.

Also, if I'm puking in the morning after I usually drink a large glass of water and then a large glass of some lemon-lime drink.  The carbonation makes the puke come up easier.  Repeat until nausea ends.  That way you're not just puking up stomach acid.  It makes the rest of the day much easier to get through. "
No way, we have kefir in the US, and it works wonders. Whole Foods has a ton of kefir, and even Giant and Safeway carry like one flavor. Kefir before and after to settle the stomach . . . That broth sounds great.
That actually does sound kind of amazing...so much better than pressing your face to the cool porcelain side of the toilet bowl.
I just did this for new years. Everytime I have popped a five hour energy before drinking I seem to wake up with no hangover.
I came here to say this. The first 10 minutes of the workout are miserable, but then I start feeling very good as my heart rate and metabolism increase, and I start sweating out the hangover. 
Alka seltzer is a godsend and I can't believe more people don't use it for hangovers. It's like they WANT to suffer.
"**DO NOT** take aspirin or Tylenol before bed. Both medications rely on the same liver enzyme as alcohol to be metabolized, ad your liver is already taxed at that point as is.

Advil is okay, because it utilizes a different one, but take it with food, because it might put you over the edge into pukey territory due to its tendency to upset stomachs. "
In other news, hundreds were found dead from asphyxiation by peanut butter this morning. Police have no leads.

Absolutely disgusting. I couldn't fathom drinking milk, let alone that much, after a night of drinking. Hell, it'd probably help because I'd throw up everything I drank prior.

What does that do? All the alcohol is already in your system. All you puke up is stomach acids. Better to just eat a rolaids and drink some water.
Usually the smell of alcohol is enough to make me gag if I'm hung over enough. Forget about trying to drink it lol
Often while hungover I already feel like puking. Drinking pickle juice would be a good way to vomit 100% of the time. 
"Cold pizza, energy drink, ice tea, and some fresh air worked somewhat well this morning. It wasn't a miracle cure, but then again, I drank enough to kill a moose... I have a huge blackout from 10.30 to 12.30, and a few blank spots outside of that.

No regrets."
That sounds really good now (and good for you), but there's no possible way I could keep that down while hung over. Although sometimes throwing up is good, I guess, if you haven't already. 
Worst advice in this thread. So your body is fucked up from having too much sugar and too little water in your system. Try putting liquid sugar in your system, it fills you up your stomach with the one thing it doesn't want.
Literally the best food in the world. I could, without a doubt, eat it for the rest of my life. And it does wonders for a hangover. Checking in from Cleveland, Ohio here.
Truth.  Also works well if taken prior to being hungover (ie. Still drunk). 4am pho is the best thing ever!
Pho seems like the only thing I ever *really* crave when I'm hungover. Why did I move to this tiny, Pho-less island? Fuck...
My college actually makes everyone take a mandatory alcohol education class. They didn't teach us the important stuff though, like how to cure a hangover.
"I know three ways to cure hangovers permanently. 

1) Never drink again

2) Never get sober again

3) Die"
Same here. I sometimes drink, well... way more than I should. But I never wake up with a hangover. Never had any headaches, no aches at all really. Just a very active gastric system.
"It's essentially what /u/Faranya says. You have more efficient enzyme production.

I will note that I was the exact same way. I didn't experience a hangover until my 27th birthday, and that was likely the result of half a bottle of Everclear, that I downed with the help of a snow cone machine, on top of a *LOT* of other drinks.

Some people just have more efficient bodily functions and 'luck out' in that regard. As a result of that, some of us just have a higher limit before we hit hangover symptoms it seems."
Depends on how long you have been drinking, at least in my experience.  The hangovers have gotten worse for me as I've been drinking for a longer period of my life.  A lot of people I know who haven't been drinking as long or as much as me don't get nearly as hung over.
My wife is the same, whereas I always get blinding hangovers, even when I've only drunk a reasonable amount (Drunk but not smashed). We figure it's because she's Scottish and has a system honed over generations to be hardy and tolerant of alcohol, while I'm half-Japanese, and inherited my mother's complete inability to drink anything more than about 3 glasses of wine in one sitting.
A hangover is simply your body being super dehydrated. If you drink water before bed, it'll make it so you're less dehydrated later. Genetics also help, but you're essentially replenishing your body with fluids.
"Its all about the water intake... i am the same... but if i forgetto drink the water then im fucked
Like now for example :("
The water helps you from being dehydrated. I know the reason you get the headache is because your brain shrinks and pulls on the lining of the cranial cavity. If you drink the extra water your brain will be less likely to lose a lot of fluids.
personally I used to be a lush Up to a case ( 24, not 12 ) And never had hangovers myself. Water and and lots of v8 juice. Rarely drink now though. Don't see a point in it. 
"Try having 1.5-2 liters of vodka per day for three days straight. (a liter is is a solid drinking session, but you want to be continuously drunk, hence keep drinking in the morning).

I will guarantee unpleasentness on the fourth morning, unless you die of alcohol poisoning first, Mr. Up-to-twelve-drinks."
Trust me, bookmark this shit for when you turn 32.  I too was immune to hangovers for years, but being 30 is a hell of a thing...
I got literally no hangovers until I was around 28. I could literally drink to passing out in a bar bathroom and be fine the next day. I'm 31 and the hangovers are enough to limit me to five drinks a night and I'll have an ok day.
"I'm in the same boat! I have drunken alot of different alcoholic beverages (usually vodka, but also beer, wine, rum etc.), i have been so drunk i can't remember anything the day after, but i still always wake up feeling well. I'd love to know why this is too. 

I'm 6 feet 5 inches tall and i weight 194 pounds, i lift 5 days a week and i am an ectomorph."
"is that 12 pints of full strength beer? if so i bow to you.
If your just having 12 bourbon and cokes your only warming up get some australian or european friends they will show you what a hangover should look like.

The water before bed always helps also not going to bed with a gut full of pizza or souvlake"
"I have the same wonderful ability. Regardless of how much or how long I drink as long as I have a few glasses of water before bed I never get a hangover. In fact I have on many occasions woken up at 9am (after going to bed plastered at 3am) and gone for a jog no problem. 

I treat it as a blessing. I have only ever suffered from one hangover and it is because I passed out without having any water after striking my head off a kitchen table. The worst part of the hangover was the headache which I assume was mostly due to the fall."
This is quite common in alcoholics when young. I'm not saying you are an alcoholic. Studies show that alcoholics often process alcohol differently, and lack of hangovers when young is one of them. So, you might want to be aware of that. 
"I'm the same way. I've been ridiculously drunk multiple times. I've drank more than half a fifth of cheap bottom of the barrel vodka. I've drank something like 20 beers in a night. I've mixed numerous different types of alcoholic beverages in the same night. I don't think I have ever been hung over.


One thing I notice though is I tend to get very thirsty and very hungry when I drink so I will drink a lot of water and eat a lot of food when I'm drunk. I don't think many other people do this. People tell me it's my genetics but I think you just gotta stay hydrated.


I'm also a 26 year old male around 170 pounds."
"I'm the exact same. No matter how much I drink I don't get a hangover. I can be tired and milk will taste bad for the day but no headache or anything. I used to think it was drinking water before going to bed and didn't matter how drunk I was I would always have water but a few times I forgot and was still fine.
"
I have no hangover as long as I consume 8 oz of water for every 1-2 shots I drink.  However, if I pass about 8 shots, I wake up after about 4 hours of sleep and am nauseous and insomniac for 1-2 hours, before falling back asleep again and waking up later entirely unaffected.  I'm not sure why alcohol affects me in that way, but it's very unpleasant, so that's my defense against drinking too much.
There are two options here. One, what you are saying is true and you're a unique human being with superpowers. Two, what you're saying is simply not true. No person can have as much to drink as possible and avoid a hangover with a couple of glasses of water before going to bed. Hard to tell which option is right.
Kinda like you. Worst case, I will feel groggy in the morning, but never the typical hangover things like headaches or light sensitivity or anything.
"I really can't see how. Perhaps endorphin release from exercise makes you feel better, but I can't see how enzymatic reactions can be affected by exercise. Maybe something with metabolism... I am aware that the Tarantella dance was used to speed up the clearance of the never-fatal tarantula venom, but I'm unsure if it was effective.

Your body may clear aldehyde at a faster rate than most people (genetics), with a higher total body water content to dilute whatever alcohol is present (increased muscle mass).  
I didn't really get hangovers in my 20's but I definitely began to get them in my 30's.  Perhaps your body doesn't process the alc. as efficiently as you age.

When I was in the military, after a long night of boozing, our corpsman used to hook us up with lactated ringer's before turning in. Felt like I hadn't even been drinking.

"A saline IV is a REALLY efficient way to re-hydrate, even compared to drinking - no throwing it back up, no taste problems, and it all goes straight to your bloodstream. The delivery mechanism itself is the cure, not what's in it.

There's also a common IV treatment called a banana bag, which is saline loaded with vitamins and potassium. Again, efficient delivery, and efficient resupply of electrolytes... Plus, potassium helps with your tiredness and soreness."
"Just looked it up on epocrates and a few other sites.  I don't think you can add it to an IV, it's taken orally (dissolves on the tongue).  This could be a problem if you are vomiting.  I know they make another medication in a rectal suppository form, it kicks in 5 minutes after insertion and stops vomiting/dry heaves.

You ever get wasted and pass out right away? The craziest dreams. So no, drunkeness is never wasted in the hands of the capable.
I tend to eat a pickle/take a shot of pickle juice in the morning and it always helps settle my stomach. I guess that's replacing lost salts. I also figure the vinegar is balancing the pH of my stomach somehow. My friends and I swear by this so you might also give it a try. 
I've noticed that when I have a moderate to severe hangover, I want the nastiest, greasiest breakfast I can find. IHOP has served for many years as my go-to hangover breakfast joint. Largely because I usually don't wake up until noon, and they serve breakfast all day. Aww yeah.
"> Eat a big, greasy, protein-rich breakfast

Egg McMuffin combo with coke.  Let the ice melt a bit.  Perfect."
All good advice except the last piece.  When I wake up with a hangover nausea the last thing I want to do is eat; much less a greasy protein rich meal.
It's not just excessive urination, it interrupts the hormones that cause your kidneys to process out blood contaminants, so you piss out all your water but without getting rid of anything you normally would. Source: Crashcourse Biology
I follow those steps.  Also,  if I drink a lot,  I finish with a bloody marry and have  V8 as thirst my  quencher when I get home. I usually feel aright when I wake up. If I still feel woozy,  I use an old Mexican remedy : Tonic water,  squeeze of lime juice,  and salt.  Eat a meal and chug it.  More V8 helps too.
"I can second this, hardest part is forcing yourself to eat because you're too weak to do anything. Preparing fatty food the night before is a godsend in that case. 

I also tend to drink milk and eat something fatty/salty a while before on the night I drink. Of course, if I get shitfaced, then I tend to forget that ... "

What do you do if you're like me, and the idea of eating something greasy when hungover makes you want to hurl?"
"Yeah, drink smarter and it's all fine. I don't get why people go to after-parties drunk enough and all in a good mood just looking to wind down and continue drinking, I mean why waste precious alcohol that will just be slept away and ruin the day after? That, and of course water. Eating something before going to sleep usually helps as well, maybe not with dealing with alcohol but it usually feels better when waking up.

I've been really hungover maybe 3 times and slightly hungover 5-10 times since I started drinking 7 years ago, and most of the times it has been when drinking has gotten way out of control. Went to bed just before 4 this morning, didn't sleep much due to a very small bed, very warm room and a very warm girlfriend and when the alarm went off at 11 I was extremely tired but felt great. Took the last beer just before 2 last night which to me is unusually late, but it worked out fine.

And to all people calling you a pussy for declining a beer after midnight - Who's the fucking pussy now when you're whining on facebook after waking up at dinnertiming feeling like a minion of seahorses gangraped your gut? Either stop drinking like a teenage jackass or stop whining."
Does the smart water have anything to contribute mineral/electrolyte wise? A girl did a presentation in my speech class to eat a banana (potassium) and a bottle of smart water 
"All of this is amazing, except the last part. I simply cannot eat anything fried the next day if I am massively hungover. Eggs are a no-go, I can't do bacon or sausage, and anything else with grease just disgusts me. I tend to eat some string cheese and maybe some leftover baked chicken or some sort of soup. And I'll snack on pretzels or something else salty.

If I cannot keep anything down I try to go with different liquids and toast with jelly (no butter!). It won't make you feel insanely better, but it's better than continuing to ache and explode through both ends all day."

Swimming is great because it soothes your hangover as soon as you get in the water though, the cool water rushing against your head is fucking bliss.
Former paintball player here, I agree as well, used to have scheduled practice 10 in the morning Sundays. Best way to kill a hangover.
Uhh, no. Hangovers suck, but they're nowhere near severe enough to put you at physical risk with something like swimming. All I can think of that might not be a great idea (depending on HO severity) is driving a car, because nausea and a headache might be too distracting and interfere somehow.
I actually prefer standing in the break and either jumping or ducking the waves. After getting smashed by the waves for a while the hangover will go away.
"As an American who's never tried the stuff, even after hearing both extremes of how it allegedly tastes, I must admit I'm still intrigued on trying it.

+1 for coconut water. Apparently they used to use coconut water as a replacement for IV fluids in the Pacific Theater during WWII. 
yes, it is not wise to mix drugs while drinking heavily due to the increased absorption with most drugs.

A hangover is usually the by-product of getting dehydrated. Too many people don't drink water with their drinks (a small glass every few beers) because it's not tough or whatever. "
Some pain killers are bad--acetominophen/Tylenol--aspirin and ibuprofen probably won't harm your liver. 
That's only if you consistently binge drink and grossly ignore the recommended daily drug limits. Popping 2 x 325 mg aspirins while drunk is not going to kill you/add to your liver problems.
"Paracetamol/acetominophen is the worst one, when it's metabolised normally it forms a small amount of a reactive compound that in normal levels is safely cleared without doing any damage. When alcohol is involved, it activates CYP2E1 which produces more of this reactive compound, hence liver damage. 

NSAIDs shouldn't be that bad as their metabolism isn't affected by alcohol, but increased drinking could affect liver function."
Never thought I'd say this, but thank fuck for being allergic to most over the counter pain killers! 
The effects listed there will not happen unless you are abusing alcohol or using doses above that recommended. They are consequences of long term abuse. 
If you get drunk regularly liver and kidney problems will be exacerbated by pain relievers, but if you can count the number of times you drink too much each year on one hand your risk level is pretty low. Get the extra relief. Another pill to take is a multi vitamin before bed.  
I think it has more to do with the fact that the aspirin is working while you're sleeping, and thus allows your body to get better rest.  Most people don't realize that alcohol affects sleep in a negative way, so you might sleep for 8 hours after drinking but still feel like you're not well rested.  This also affects how bad your hang over will be the next morning, because better rest = better preparation for your body to handle sickness.
Yeah whatever. Hey everyone, check out Mr. Personal Responsibility over here! Get a load of this guy! I bet you even have a great interest rate on your affordable mortgage because of your excellent credit history! What a maroon! 
Aspirin does no harm to the liver whatsoever. Tylenol, on the other hand, should be avoided in combination with alcohol. 
Actually, aspirin or ibuprofen is preferred to acetaminophen, which is tough on your liver. Apparently, acetaminophen causes more cases of liver cirrhosis than alcohol.
The danger with aspirin is that it thins your blood, as does the alcohol.  Aspirin doesn't really hurt your liver, that's acetaminophen.  
I like to take ketonal (ketoprofenum) for bad hangovers. Got it after my leg surgery, it's basically the strongest non-opioid painkiller.

"Water before going to bed helps much much more than after you wake up.

But if you get drunk enough that your body won't let you drink water in the morning you'd probably be hungover anyway since it's closing in on alcohol poisoning."
For me it only works when the most urgent symptoms go away, that is throwing up and searing headaches. Whenever I'm not going to throw up at any moments notice, I roll up. After that a pizza and a coke and I'm all done with being hung over.
Oh ya if i have work the day after the night i get smashed I just smoke a little (or alot) and I'm good to go to work
"To me marijuana is the only thing that have been effective for real on symptoms. When I'm hungover, like right know, I've got this weird feeling in my stomach that I never have any other time, it's like I'm trying to read while I'm in a car, I feel very nauseous and it makes me tired. Marijuana will make me a lot more tired, and I'll probably won't be able to do anything during the whole day besides getting high, but this horrible nausea just vanishes (and nothing else ever made it vanish, it's a miracle to me) and I feel good again. 

If like me you have really hard hangovers, marijuana is a blessing."
"Yep. It's not just that it makes you feel good; it actually completely masks the shitty hangover feeling (at least for me it does).

It's not a perfect cure, since you can't use it if you have important stuff to do that morning, but if it's still the weekend this is my go-to."
Like black magic. For real. I smoke one bowl as soon as I'm sure I'm not gonna projectile vomit the first time I cough, and within ten minutes, I feel like sunshine and pancakes.
It takes away the headache, and then makes you feel better!  Also, it makes you hungry.  Eating is crucial to getting over a hangover.
Have used this method every time. Works like a charm every time. Usually makes my stomach feel good enough so i can actually get food down to do it's job. Im talking going from vomiting violently to feeling almost normal instantly. Its glorious.
The best medicine for what I feel is the biggest problem with hangovers: nausea/appetite/holding liquids and food down. If you just smoke, but don't drink any water, eat any food, take vitamins, get up and move around (kickstart your body into recoup mode) then it is just a palliative for a short time. For my worst hangovers, marijuana doesn't even make me feel high. It just makes me not want to be dead. That is when you can start with the hydration, foods, vitamins you pissed out, etc. Give it a few hours, toke up again, and this time you feel high/euphoria.
You're doing marijuana? Be careful dude, I knew a guy who did 4 marijuanas once and now he's in a comma :(

Yes the Benadryl works wonders. I actually found out about it when I was in the hospital for food poisoning. They gave me some liquid Benadryl in my iv and my vomiting stopped right away. The nurse said it helps with the smooth muscles in the stomach which cause vomiting. She told me to stop on my way home and get some more just in case the vomiting came back.

Not really. I go to Subway and get lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions. Always does the trick for me.
Ive always found that breaking a sweat and elevating your heart rate for a good bit of time helps with a hangover.  I think a brisk 30 to 45 minute walk would help with this though, I don't know that it has to be a hard fucking run.  Usually you have to do a bit of recovering before this is really possible, so I doubt it will save your day or anything.
Sorry I was unclear.  Heard it from a professor.   I can't remember his rationale.    It was definitely sugar though.
Breaking a sweat and getting the body moving has always helped me.  You might try a schvitz if you don't think moving is possible.
Is that so? I'll test it tomorrow morning by trying a glass of the mix only and get back to you. I know it's not placebo-immune, but it's worth a shot. 
yes Ideally you'll want to do that the night before.  Also ideally you'll drink a glass of water between drinks but I rarely ever see that happen.  Water and ibproufen/aspirin is key.  that'll take care of most of the stuff other than perhaps the stomach issues.  For that I recommend bananas.  eat a couple of bananas in the morning with water and ibproufen/aspirin and i'm right as rain in about an hour.

Fair. Not all of us can be the drinking gods that Europeans are. You guys do get a head start after all.
i love how because this particular american isn't a particularly heavy drinker, every country is now going to chime in with how much more they drink. Let me assure you all that there are plenty of places in America where 12 drinks over the course of a night of drinking wouldn't be considered all that much.
True that. there's a gene responsible for alcohol metabolism, I forget the particulars, but you either process alcohol like a poison (and you get hangovers) or your body doesn't mind it too much (so no hangover). AA calls this 'the alcoholism gene,' which i think is total bullshit. Just because you can drink and not physically suffer the next day doesn't make you an alcoholic.  
That, and people vary in how badly they react to aldehyde, it's genetic and we have a decent start on understanding the factors. That's why certain ethnicities always tend to turn a bit red when they drink.

It can be very yummy - but be sure to try a couple different brands.  They vary a lot in the way they taste.
You can find it in almost any grocery store that has a baby food aisle. Also a lot of places like Walgreens carry it as well. It seems to be slightly cheaper in the grocery stores from my experience though. So worth it though!

He used to do it until he found out that it was causing severe damage to his spinal cord and cerebellum.
yeah tums is Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) add it to stomach acid (HCl) and it forms an acid base rxn. caco3+2hcl -> cacl2+co2+h2o. So, you get stomach relieve and a ton of water delivered. Science.
I've used Hangover Heaven.  It helps.  The whole process takes about an hour from the time they pick you up from your hotel to the time where they drop you off. On a scale to 10, 10 being the worst hangover ever experienced, I'd say it brought my hangover from an 8 down to a 3.

would this relieve nausea and a headache?  it's just hard to believe simple saline could really make much of a difference in a hangover.  seems like you'd need to use multiple drugs in conjunction with the quick hydration from the IV.  
interesting, i never really thought about just shooting straight salt water into your bloodstream.  how much would be dangerous?  seems like it could dilute your blood easily. 
"I actually have it in an inject-able (intramuscular) form and another that dissolves on the tongue, which is the one in question. You are correct the oral route doesn't work while vomiting.

The answer is always going to be a resounding no, for good reason, was hoping you knew why for this particular drug. 

Also it is useless for vomiting and great for nausea. I've never been able to go from dead sick to not without Promethazine but that's not a sharable one or anything you'd want to.

Thanks much for looking it up for me. Like I said in my edit I think I'm comfortable if it's infrequent but I'll continue being wary. I've taken it for years now and had no major side effects, but it has all of nothing to interact with generally. Also it appears to be OTC in some parts of Europe, so that always makes me feel a bit more secure. As well as it being used for morning sickness. xD I feel silly for asking now."
Verified. Also if you get super wasted it's much better to stay awake drinking water than to go to bed. Tired gt hungover.
Agreed.  On a similar note, it's never the fall that kills a suicidal jumper.  Just the sudden stop at the end.
I never have believed this. I occasionally start getting the pounding headache long before I'm anywhere near sober.
I'm pretty sure you're the downfall of alcoholics anonymous. On the bright side you'd do pretty well in advertisement.

You will just have a hangover while being drunk. Drunkenness does not prevent the dehydration/hangover. It just reinforces it.
Maybe but I wasn't talking about drinking moderately. When you are getting a hangover from NYE you are probably still drunk the next morning. Drinking more will do *nothing* good to your body. Alcohol is poison and trying to erase the symptoms by poisoning your body even more is not the best way. Maybe it dazes/numbs the senses but there are better ways to do that too.
Only if you are sober enough to not get the spins though...but does that count as hungover, or still drunk?
It gets rid of nausea too.  One of the worst hangovers I ever had lingered until 9pm the day after because I didn't have any food in me.  I couldn't eat all day due to the nausea, and throwing up twice.  I tried to eat and couldn't.  If I had gotten stoned and just chowed down it would have helped a lot.
Not sure if this is just me, but B-vits almost never fail to make me vomit within thirty minutes if I'm hungover. No problems at all if I haven't been drinking the night before.

Alcohol can saturate enzymes in the liver stopping normal metabolism of Tylenol and instead forming toxic metabolites that damage the liver.  If you had a few drinks its fine but if you have a hangover then it would probably do more harm than good.  Also don't take more than 2g of Tylenol per day

">there's a gene

As a geneticist, this phrase always makes me cringe. I applaud your willingness to understand genetics, I wish more people were like you, but always make sure you ask people who tell you stuff like this why they think a single gene is the cause of something that is so obviously multifactorial, like alcoholism, obesity, criminality.... "
"I think it has to do with the fact that a person with that ""gene"" doesn't get the negative physical consequences of drinking (not to say they don't do stupid shit while drunk) and therefore don't get reinforcement not to drink. A hangover doesn't stop a person from being hungover, but I can see some margin of validity that not getting a hangover can lead to more drinking."
I would drink way more often if I could forget the time I spent every 15 minutes for 4 hours puking. And every hangover before that. Just a glass of alcohol makes my stomach upset and the thought makes me nauseous. If I didn't get hangovers, I'd definately drink more often. They aren't saying the gene alone is making you an alcoholic, but not having to deal with the consequences of a hangover tends to make a person motre inclined to drink more often, which in turn can lead to an addiction.
Yeah, I'm one of those people and I still don't drink. It irritates me as well...such a crappy way of putting that.

You just 'train' your drinking skills and if you haven't been drinking for a couple of weeks, just a single beer can make your legs feel woozy. That's also why all the 'are you an alcoholic' tests (at least here in the Netherlands) state that the results do not apply on students... ;)"

If you're dehydrated, rehydration is really just replacing water that should be in your blood anyway - and if you put in too much, you'll pee it out. I imagine that it would be very difficult to put so much saline in your body that you pass out before you pee out the excess.

True. But chances are the alcohol you've been drinking all night is even worse anyway. Each beer is about 200 empty calories. If you're concerned about getting a hangover then you've probably already consumed about 2000 empty calories, a few hundred more is hardly a real concern.

I haven't noticed that.  To me, waking up feeling moderately thirsty is the norm, because I can't drink water within an hour of bed or else I wake up in the middle of the night to pee.  So to consider myself dehydrated, I have to wake up feeling absolutely parched.  This has never been the case provided I've made sure to hydrate properly while drinking.
Actually, no, they won't. The alcohol will do that on its own, in excess, but the addition of the NSAIDs doesn't change that risk.
Bad in high doses over the long term, yes, for your stomach and kidneys. Not especially harmful to the liver, other than in the same way any medication is, i.e. they get broken down in the liver, generally.
And kidney failure, eventually. But the point of the comment was the enhanced hepatotoxicity of acetaminophen when combined with alcohol. It's a misconception that the problem is pain relievers in general, when actually Tylenol is the culprit in this biochemical process.
yep, can't tell you how many times my former medic father would call me up to have me help hook him up to an IV the morning after he had a few too many. also can't explain how awkward that is when there are friends around when he brings over a needle and a bag of saline and I get the IV going before he carries the bag back to bed. I prefer just chugging water before bed, personally, but to each his own.
My girlfriend is a nurse but she won't steal me saline out of some irrational fear of 'losing her job'. Some people think their employment is more important than a hangover, idiots.
"True, it's the chronic alcohol intake that's the problem. But at least according to my pharmacy teacher, there's still a bit of controversy regarding how long it takes for alcohol intake to count as ""chronic"". There is little evidence regarding how the cytochrome metabolism pathway is affected if you've, say, been drinking alcohol for, say four consecutive days.

Nah, if I wake up hungover and my buddies and I start drinking again, that hangover is gone. And we're drunk and probably playing Mario Kart, so that's pretty great too.
This.  I once smoked while driving home from a party the next morning.  I was so hung over that I didn't realize I was actually still drunk; I just thought I was super hung over, and smoking usually helps me.  Got the spins, and passed out while driving.  Thankfully I felt it coming on about 10 seconds before it happened, so I pulled over and had put the car into park literally the moment before I passed out.  Woke up with my head on the steering wheel, and I had shit my pants.  Then had an hour drive home.  Awful.

If you're waking up drunk, your immediate problem is that you're about to sober up. AVOID THIS. (Unless you're at work, in which case your immediate problem is that you're at work and about to be in a world of pain.) Eat protein-ey fatty food and drink a beer or two, then nurse it down.

Otherwise, it depends on what you mean when you say ""hangover"". Most of the time, when people say hangover they mean dry mouth and pounding headache. This is just dehydration due to alcohol's diuretic properties and fixed quickly and easily by drinking water or sports drinks.

Beyond that, if by hangover you mean upset stomach and general sick feeling then you're verging on alcohol poisoning. Keep your stomach full of greasy starchy food and wait it out, there's not much more you can do."

I'm gonna chime in here, too.  Twenty years old and I've never had a drop of alcohol.  I'll be in Ireland next year for study abroad, so I'd be able to drink legally over there but I don't plan on it.
not everyone really wants to jump into drinking. I had (have) an alcoholic father, so I really had no interest in drinking while in high school. Even when I got to college, I told my friends I didn't want to drink, or at least not too much. Sure enough, I did start drinking...a lot. a whole lot. Do I regret it? yes and no.

Hmm, good question. I haven't tries it yet myself, but know of people given and administrate to others. I would say it should work right away but I would hang it up and go back to sleep :P It depends on what is causing the nausea and headache, as in electrolyte unbalance, too much acidic drinking (e.g. white wine), general dehydration, ibs, bowel gas and so forth. It should clear up the nausea first though I would try some crackers to soak up the acid and give the body some to work with. The headache could easily go away as well if you hang it up and get some sleep, if you are anything like me. It all depends on how you react but remember the body is still working with processing the heavier alcohol parts

"Coffee doesn't actually dehydrate you, and if coffee makes you feel better after a long night of boozing, drinking a big cup of strong coffee is a fine choice. It helps if you also drink some Gatorade or something similar as well.

Weed is also great for hangovers, so if you enjoy smoking weed you are fine to take your mind off of your hangover that way.

For me, the best way to kill a hangover is to go out for breakfast, and smoke a joint on the way there. Order something with eggs, toast and bacon- bacon and bread has been scientifically proven to aid in hangover relief, and it's delicious and filling, so you gotta get it. If it's a hot day, ice coffee. Cold day, hot coffee!

So there you go - joint or pipe, big breakfast (make sure it has toast and bacon) and some coffee. Get a Gatorade or its ilk as well, and if needed, toss back a couple ibuprofens.

Irish coffee will also make you feel better, but it's probably not the best remedy.

In what world does coffee not dehydrate you?  Coffee makes me pee more than any other drink, including alcohol.  
">Coffee doesn't actually dehydrate you

STOP RIGHT THERE!

you are in violation of rational science.

caffeine (which is in coffee) is a diuretic which means that it makes you lose water through urination (hence why you use the bathroom more when drinking energy drinks and/or coffee). so yes, it actually DOES dehydrate you."
When I've had a bit too much to drink or I've been doing shots, I have some Gatorade before I go to bed and whenever I wake up (usually once or twice to take a leak) then just have it on hand when I start my day.  Works wonders.
"I think I read something about caffeine being added to those painkillers to make them act faster. Also, caffeine is useful for those of us who are addicted to it and get headaches without it. 

And on the earlier point of caffeine dehydrating you, it would be true if you just scooped coffee into your mouth however, if you're mixing it with a cup full of water, you're more than undoing how much it can dehydrate you."
So is beer.  It dehydrates you because it is a diuretic, meaning there is a hormone in it which causes your body to piss out most of the water available in your body.

"True, but coffee is still has a positive ratio of hydration to dehydration, basically, there is more water in the coffee than the caffeine will make you piss out.

Source: google ""does caffeine dehydrate you."""
I always wondered if drinking coffee would cause more water loss than the amount of water in the coffee. I imagine there's a net gain of water.
I think it has to do with the volume of water in coffee. An espresso shot may dehydrate you, but coffee probably won't because you're also drinking 12 ounces of water. 
According to Wikipedia, it doesn't dehydrate you from ordinary consumption. Studies have shown coffee to be no less hydrating than juice. 
"False. Some people experience diuretic effects from caffeine but not all. It's not actually a ""diuretic"". "
"This is only true after a certain point; having just one cup of coffee usually isn't enough caffeine to cause the diuretic effects, but having multiple cups will make you piss like there's a contest for who can pee the most and you need to win.

Edit: the diuretic effects of caffeine are different for every person, so some people can have a lot more than others without this happening.  I usually forgo coffee during a hang over anyway, just because I usually can't eat with a hang over and drinking coffee on a mostly empty stomach causes sever irritation in my belly."
"Ah, I remember reading somewhere that the coffee/water ratio is low enough, and the coffee isn't dehydrating enough, that the water portion far outweighs the coffee portion. Maybe that's not true. 

edit: http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gepka/i_know_that_caffeine_and_alcohol_dehydrate_you/"
A single cup of coffee does not have enough caffeine to dehydrate you, and combining it with painkillers increases their effectiveness.

Correct, there are also a lot of other sources if you google it. The only reason I'm coming out so strongly about the subject is that I clearly remember studying about this for school recently. 
Beer is only hydrating up to a certain ABV which IIRC is less than 4.0%, so your typical beer isn't hydrating.
So then hangovers aren't caused from dehydration and won't be prevented by drinking a cup of water for every beer you have?
Where did you hear this? Coffee has a lot of caffeine and people don't usually drinks loads of it. I find it hard to believe that the caffeine is outweighed by volume. Caffeine is actually a pretty powerful diuretic. 
We did a urine lab in physiology and measured the amount of urine generated in people drinking caffeinated drinks, water, and other variables such as dehydration. Caffeine actually was an impressive diuretic web you controlled for other variables.
"Physical withdrawal symptoms are a needed but not a *sufficient* requirement to call something a ''physical addiction''. I.e. if you work out every day intensively for a long period of time and then stop, you will experience a sudden drop of energy and serotonin levels (sorry I can't quote an article on this, but I think that those facts are fairly trivial; in short, body produces more energy if it uses more energy, and also makes more serotonin during physical activity (sports are even used in anxiety/depression treatments, but that's a different story)), and you can't say that exercise is physically addictive. 

Still, it doesn't matter since no studies showed any of the chemicals found in marijuana cause insomnia, so it is treated as a psychological ''problem'' until proven otherwise. 
 
In addition it is not a problem that occurs in every case of marijuana consumption (unlike the withdrawal symptoms from i.e. meth), I personally can sleep anytime. I mean **anytime**."

In my experience, no. For me a hangover is something that either happens or doesn't happen. There is a correlation between the amount I drink but I've blacked out and woke up feeling great as well as had maybe two drinks and wound up feeling terrible. Water can't hurt though, so why not?

And From my USMLE text:
>Acute acetaminophen overdose usually manifests with doses higher than 7 g in adults, but concomitant alcohol abuse lowers the threshold of hepatic toxicity.

From another USMLE text:
>Chronic alcohol use leads to depleted stores of glutathione, resulting in increased risk of hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen overdose.

If the above has not cured you, you are probably still drunk."
"This is going to get done to death in here. Drink water, do not wait untill you wake up to try and play catch up rehydrating your body. If you are going to drink make sure you are well hydrated before hand. Keep drinking water while you are consuming your beverage of choice. Don't consume alcohol on an empty stomach. Drink water before you sleep, when you wake up, and try not to drink enough to kill a child.
TLDR: Your body needs water, so drink that shit."
"Saline IV drips. Either you need a good friend in the med practice with spare IV tubing and paraphernalia, or you could visit a business like [**this one**](http://www.revivme.com/dispatcher.php?x_permalink=no&url=/).

I can't do the greasy food thing that everyone I know is into - makes me feel even worse. I drink about a litre of water before I go to bed, then in the morning I very slowly drink a peppermint tea and stand in the shower for a while... Then usually go back to bed.
"Toast and bacon apparently.

"Two glasses of water before bed. Two glasses in the morning, followed by Alka Seltzer, Tea, Scrambled Eggs with chorizo, chilli, avocado and toast. 

Follow that with a trip to the Gym to squat and deadlift and a dip in the pool afterwards. Sip a Lucozade while doing this. 

Leg day with a hangover is one of life's most gratifying challenges. Theres nothing quite like sweating it out under a bar, soaking your tshirt and leaving a puddle of mostly gin on the floor beneath you. 

Dip in the pool afterwards, even have a sauna and then RE DIP!. Return to your place as your housemates are just stirring and bask in the glow of their incredulity as they demand to know just how in the hell you can feel so good after sleeping so little and drinking so much. 

If anybody else struggles to sleep through their hangovers, do this:

Alka Selzter and Water to rehydrate and settle your stomach

Eggs for protein, Chorizo for salt, Chilli for Capsaicin, Avocado for Fat, Toast for carbs. 

Physical Activity plus Lucozade to stop you feeling sorry for yourself.

Swim and Sauna to freshen up. "
"Foul stomach?  A [prairie oyster]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_oyster_(cocktail%29) and a zantac.     

Foul head?  Fluids and a b vitamin.   

Both?  Follow the order above."
Coke-a-Cola and some type of deep-fried potatoes: potato chips, hashbrowns, french fries. Lots of water the night before helps too.

"Most efficient:
Kombucha, Pedialyte, advil and a greasy breakfast


Most Enjoyable:
Bojangles, Blowjob, and Breakfast Beer"
"I am usually pretty good about downing enough water during drinking and before I go to bed, but hangovers aren't all dehydration so sometimes I still feel pretty rough the next morning.

Keys the morning after:
First - Sugary drinks: coke with ice or a milkshake works wonders.  I've covered the dehydration part the night before but with your liver working hard all night to process the alcohol everyone usually wakes up with lower-than-usual blood sugar so something sweet can get those levels up and something super cold is a great way to cure those Milwaukee's Best sweats.  

Second - food: I go for something that covers the bases: eggs, bacon, buttered toast and some fruit.  Just a hardy breakfast that isn't going to force my body to process a bunch more foreign (oily, fatty, etc) foods.  I over do it sometimes with gut bombs of fried foods and processed cheeses and always regret it.

Third - caffeine:  The combination of getting up a few times in the middle of the night to get rid of all that water/alcohol I drank means I got some shitty sleep.  This is a good kick in the pants to wake you up.

Last: Aspirin and shower.  Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen both can cause serious issues when taken with or after consuming alcohol.  Always take the morning after.  I tend to take *nothing* before bed other than water.  I'm already putting my liver through the paces asking it to process large quantities of alcohol.  I'm not a fan of fucking with it and asking it to process medicine and alcohol at the same time.  Also, a shower, cause it feels great.

Bonus: If you know a doctor or are one: IV drips.  I hear they are the perfect cure, I just happen to be terrified of needles.

Edit: grammar"
Pint of water when I get back, then when I wake up, another pint of water, then a shower, then a cup of tea and something totally unhealthy to eat
"1) Drink a big ol' glass of water before bed.
2) Slightly burnt, buttery toast for breakfast. If you have bacon, stick it in the frying pan!
3) Coffee, black, with sugar and a small amount of salt. not enough to make it taste salty, but I'm afraid it's still gonna taste weird!
4) Cranberry juice, preferably with a small (like half a shot) amount of vodka in it.

You'll be feeling right as rain in no time!"
Chug a bottle of Pedialyte in the morning. Nap for 2 hours.  Chug a Gatorade.  Eat greasy Chinese food.  Drink.  Repeat Process.
"This is my favorite thing to talk about...

So alcohol prevents this hormone (ADH) from being released. ADH is what stops you from peeing/it helps you retain water that you need. So basically, when you're drunk, you're just peeing out all the water you need (which I think makes your brain cells shrink - this is what actually causes the hangover). 

So if you just keep matching each drink you have with a glass of water or just chug a lot of it before you go to bed (pee before you do this though so you can drink as much water as possible), you should be fine in the morning - maybe a little bit dizzy if it was a really crazy night. So also keep some water by your bed for the morning. When you wake up, drink more water, eat something greasy like bacon or eggs (no idea why this helps but I swear by it).

TLDR; Drink water, pee, repeat, and also my false belief that I could teach biology."
"Take a long shower, sitting down in it.  Drag my corpse downstairs to cook up the greasiest food we have in the house.  Drink as much liquid as I can fit in me.  Drag my corpse back up to my bedroom, and lay face down for a little while.

I don't get hangovers easily, but when I do they are nightmarish."
First things first, try to get drunk-you to dink water before bed. Then if you wake up super early before the real hangover sets in, try to get yourself a snack. I usually wake up at about 5 am with crazy low blood sugar, I find that a spoonful of peanut butter is perfect. Drinking more water here is good, but avoidable if you think you won't be able to fall asleep with a full stomach. If you wake up later in the day still feeling hungover, I like to have a breakfast sandwich with as mug bacon as possible and some chocolate milk-- no real scientific reason for those ones... They are just tastey enough to encourage me to eat when I'm feeling icky. Good luck out there! Feel better! 
Lots and lots of water.  At least 1 whole water bottle for every hour you were out drinking.  You're not going to want to, but try to power through.  Every time you get up during the night (most likely bathroom) another bottle of water.  Once I started this I've had pleasant next days every time.
drink 2 liter of water before bed, wake up, throw up if it's really bad, more water, go back to sleep. 
Watermelon is like magic to me. It's super moist (ew hate that word), so good for hydration, has lots of sugars in it and is also yummy. Hail the watermelon. 
A big spicy breakfast. Usually like a breakfast bowl. You have to include eggs, meat of your choice and potatoes, but also needed is pepper jack cheese (or other spicy cheese) and hot peppers or hot sauce. I know you don't feel like eating, but trust me.
"Doctor here, I was actually working on a recipe for Anti-Hangover effervescent tablets based on the WHO rehydration recipe, comparable to ""BAKIS"" which is famous in Sweden/Netherlands/Finnland. Short summary in case any one is interested...

You are hung over due to serveral different things:

* Dehydration - ethanol inhibits the release of ADH in your brain which results in you peeing more and losing water. Rehydration is key when fighting hangover, but regaining lost electrolytes is equally important therefore isotonic drinks are suited.

* Hypoglycemia - ethanol-induced hypoglycemia can cause headache, nausea and tremor. Ever noticed how good pizza/burgers taste when you are drunk? It's because your blood sugar is dropping. Eating something will fight the hypoglycemia but might also cause additional nausea because alcohol will irritate your stomach.

* Intoxication with acetaldehyd
* Increased acidity in the blood
* Gastritis

The last points are difficult to counter, and hangover is different from person to person anyway. There is a lot of research on this topic but it's not 100% understood how hangover works.

TL;DR: Drink a lot of water and have a good meal before going out. Drink at least 0,5L isotonic sportsdrink before going to sleep, always have a few non-alcoholic drinks while partying. Have a snack (1-2 bananas) before going to bed and don't forget to eat breakfast the next day even if you feel sick."
After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak pan-fried in salted butter. I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks and go to sleep.
"I make a bunch of bacon and drink several tall glasses of water before bed. If this is cheating since it's pre-hangover prep, please ignore.

Upon waking, it goes like this:

* Something to settle the stomach so I can keep nutrients down to calm the headache. Bacon usually does the trick, but something greasy.

* A glass of milk with the greasy protein helps cut down on the stomach acid.

* Grab an ice cold beer from the fridge and an ice pack from the freezer.

* Sit in the tub with the shower running, the water aimed away from my face. Hold ice pack against forehead. Rub one out (helps ease the headache).

* After about 15 minutes, my head will stop swimming and my stomach will settle. Enjoy the beer while sitting in the shower.

* Get out, towel off, grab a cup of coffee. Rub another one out and go back to sleep for a while."
"Seriously works:
2 Vitamin B the night before, plus tons of water throughout the night.
Wake up, drink some more water, eat some carbs, take a zofran and an adderall. Perfection."
"I drink a pint of semi-skimmed milk whenever I wake up.

Having food after a heavy night out makes me throw up and I don't feel any better afterwards, and drinking copious amount of water does fuck all for me. So I grab a pint glass, fill it full of milk and drink that. Not all in one go though, that's just mental.

However, if I have nothing to do that day, sometimes I'll skip the milk and go back to drinking and go on the internet whilst wondering what the hell I'm doing with my life."
"* 1 Multivitamin

* Honey for instant sugar

* 1 Ginger Ale (with real ginger)...or pickled ginger for the stomach

* Coke or Pepsi for a blast of sugary energy

* ibuprofen

* Shit load of water

I have a small tupperware container of this stuff waiting to go."
Wake up at 8AM or so, because fuck life. Chug a few glasses of water, take 2-3 ibproufen, go back to bed until noon.
I drink as much water as I can before I go to sleep, and I'm usually hangover-free the morning after.
"Have a good protein-rich dinner beforehand so that you don't get too drunk too quickly. I know that sounds counter-productive to some of you, but if you're in for a long night, you'll only multiply your morning regrets by not eating a decent dinner.    
If I'm not too much of a drunken bastard when I get home, I try to remember to drink water before bed. You will probably wake in the middle of the night to pee, and that's good. Try to drink another glass while you're up.    
The next morning, brew some of coffee, have your favorite bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, and a gatorade if you have it (more water if not). Then treat yourself to a glorious little thing I call ""the booze poos"". I feel physically better after one of those, akin to throwing up, but a more pleasant experience than the latter.    
Bonus: Your mouth is going to taste like shit in the morning (more than normal) so brush your teeth before bed and after waking up to help that immediate nausea that you may feel when you first wake up. Most of you already do this out of habit, but I thought I'd include it anyway bc it definitely helps."
prep the night before by drinking lots of water.  wake and bake the next day if at all possible.  feel like a million bucks
"* Get out of bed and have some coffee, advil and coconut water.
* Make yourself a Bloody Mary. 
* Go lay in a hot shower. It helps with the headache until the advil kicks in. Also if you puke it's easy cleanup. You should take the Bloody Mary with you.
* Bacon and eggs, like ALL the bacon and eggs you have.
* Grab a blanket, some more water and coffee, and curl up on the couch and binge watch some netflix.
* Maybe have another Bloody Mary, you deserve it."
Pho. Although it might be a task getting to the place first. (Unless you have someone to make it for you) Poor me, last time I drank too much, I was on my way to Pho and I had to pull over to puke several times. But damnit I was determined to get my hangover cure! Got to the restaurant and proceeded to puke during the whole meal, leaving to the restroom of course, not on the table or anything. Just couldn't keep it down. I was so sad. Other than that ONE TIME, it's worked wonders for me. All that spicy sriracha sauce!
A lot of water, 4-5 extra strength advil, a greasy protein filled breakfast, taking a shit if I need to and some stop being a fucking pussy because you did this to yourself talk in the mirror.
"Wake up, chug water, mow down some pills - Tylenol, ibuprofen do it!

Get up and make a peanut butter, honey and banana sandwich. It has protein, sugar, and a shitload of potassium. Fuck it eat another banana. Chug water. Jump in shower....curl into a ball. Cry.

Get out of shower and seize the day!"
"This is where a little knowledge of science and planning will really go a long way.  The main reason you feel like poo after drinking is dehydration.  The liver of a person with an alcohol tolerance (a regular drinker) has certain pathways active that accelerate the processing of alcohol--unfortunately, they also process acetaminophen via those same pathways and produce a dangerous liver toxin as a byproduct, so you need to stay around 2 grams/day of acetaminophen instead of the normally accepted 4 grams/day.  Water + acetaminophen at night = fixed in morning, or at least dramatically better.  

Drink a full glass of water before bed and take 1g acetaminophen if you have a headache.  Set alarm for 1 hour early.  If you wake up during the night to pee, drink another glass of water and take more another 1g acetaminophen if it has been 4 hours.  Do not take more than 2g acetaminophen total if you are a regular drinker.  When the alarm goes off, pee, another full glass of water and another 1g dose of acetaminophen if it has been 4 hours since the last dose and you are not over 2g for a regular drinker or 4g for an occasional drinker.  If you don't know if you are a regular or occasional, don't take more than 2g.  Hop in the shower and take a longer than normal shower.

Even my worst hangover has been reduced down to a slight ""wishy washy"" feeling after the above technique.  Good stuff."
"hair of the dog that bit you. 
just wake up and drink the same thing you drank the night before. sounds counterproductive but you'll feel a hell of a lot better.   "
"There are actually several different types of hangovers. Almost all of these can be almost immediately cured with a ""banana bag"". It's an IV of vitamins, electrolytes and fluids. If you have a medic friend, call him. You'll feel better in no time. Otherwise - 

1. Just a headache and tired. - This one is the easiest to get rid of. All you need is a big bottle of Smart Water and a Goody Powder. You'll be feeling normal in an hour or so. 

2. Nauseated, headache and tired - This one is tough depending on how nauseated you are. You're going to need a cold rag, water, a multivitamin and whatever food you can possibly keep down. There's no magic bullet for the nausea unless you happen to have a joint laying around. 

3. Shaky, headache, tired. - You need water and food. Preferably fatty foods. A good greasy cheesesteak will do wonders here. 

4. Wired, a little dizzy. - This isn't a hangover but will become one within a couple of hours. You are still drunk and you need to find a bloody mary as quickly as possible to keep the hangover at bay. Drink until 6pm, go to bed early. No hangover. 

5. Shaky, dizzy, hot/cold sweats, generally uncomfortable, variable heart rate, feels like the flu. - This is the worst of them all. The only cure that I have found for this is a xanax. 

I am not a doctor, go to the ER if you think you're dying. Don't drink more than 2 or 3 drinks in any single sitting and you won't have to worry about hangovers. "
In all honestly, orgasm. Its all about the endorphins and dopamine that it causes your body to release, it makes you feel awesome. Works 100% of the time.
A couple glasses of Nuun (or other electrolyte drink) and then a short run. The run is hell, but after a shower and a change of clothes, I feel like a new man. 
Pho .... Maybe its deliciousness just distracts me from the hangover, but I think the broth and carbs recharges my batteries. I always feel better after a bowl
Not that it matters cuz I'm down in the depths of the post. Pho with Sriracha is the very best hangover cure in the world. 
McDonald's bacon egg and cheese bagel. And a large dr. Pepper. Do not forget the DP. very important.

Drink to your heart's content at the pub/house party, when you head to the club switch to water. You can still ride the buzz for a few hours, but you save yourself the expensive, shitty drinks and will have rehydrated/sobered up enough to be OK come morning.
As a fraternity man we have mastered hangover cures haha. The one we used primarily was before you went to bed or right as you awoke you drank a bottle of Pedialyte. Pedialyte should eliminate your symptoms before too long and actually is not to bad tasting. We also had a pre-med brother who had a strong ability to put in IV's as he was a paramedic, one bag of IV fluid will eliminate it pretty quick if not almost instantly. 
A couple Advil before bed with a large glass of iced water. If I do still develop a hangover I down a gatorade, cup of coffee and an aspirin.
I've heard many people swear by coconut water. I don't know the science behind it, but so many people I know claim that it is the ultimate cure.
"wake up, bong toke, water and or coffee, bong toke, banana. rest for 20 minutes to an hour. crack open ice cold beer. take a nice hot shower with that beer. the trick is to drink it before it gets warm. now its time for another bong toke and breakfast. depending what i can stomach, eggs is a must with some greasy breakfast sausages, fruit and orange juice. after all this, the rest of the day is spent chugging water and more shmoking. if gut rot decides to come back after my morning assault, i will drink a big ass ceasar mid afternoon.

As painful as it may be, do a light cario work out (2-3 mile jog).  Sweat out that toxic waste I continue to put into my body every weekend.
"Fresh vegetable soup made with real home made beef stock.

Hair of the dog. A few more cans in the morning and you're set to go...This may just be a Irish thing though.
McDonald's breakfast. Large coffee + large OJ + sausage biscuit with cheese + at least one hash brown = good times.
For me: Don't drink beer.  These high ABV craft beers that are so popular these days tear me up the next day.  If I drink liquor or white wine I wake up the next day feeling fine.
"along with drinking lots of water before bed, I've been known to raid the medicine supplies for multivitamins in the hope they will work

Of course there's times when that's not possible, and for that I actually found in high school that if I take vitamin B and D before bed along with some aspirin I wake up fine. Hasn't failed since then. (And yes, when I don't do either of these I wake up feeling like death itself)"
"Assuming I forgot to pound some water and take some aspirin the night before, the best morning hangover cure is Gatorade or Coconut Water (fast electrolytes), Alka Seltzer (plop plop fizz fizz...), a trip to the loo, a quick shower  and then back to bed for a couple of hours.

There is no cure for me. Basically I throw up for about 8 hours until I'm suddenly hungry again, then I eat. A lot.

Orange Juice to get my blood sugar back up, water to re-hydrate, and the greasiest egg sandwich and hash browns that Waffle House will make.

"If I can remember to drink water before I pass out. Have a water bottle readily available from where you're passed out so when you wake up in the middle if the night, you can become immediately refreshed. I usually wake up hours earlier then I want, so while Im up, ill take 2 tylenol, pound some more water and go back to sleep. Sometimes, I rip a bowl before going back to sleep. Anyways, once I'm officially up for the day. My go to cure would be a blue gatorade, 2 tylenol, a bowl pack, some form of fruit, and a mindless video game/ tv show. Sooo many Rowan University mornings were spent half drunk/ high as hell playing CoD and passing bongos around

TL;DR water, tylenol, weed, more water"
3 or 4 full pints of water before bed, then a greasy breakfast in the morning. The grease helps release enzymes that counter the effects of a hangover. The water is usually enough though
Vitamin B pills, Gatorade or water, breakfast sandwich, make poop.  In that order.  Works pretty well.
Definitely greasy food. The other day I went to my local gas station and got an egg, sausage and cheese biscuit and felt perfect afterward. I don't know how it works, but I'm not complaining.

Mine is not for the faint of heart. If you can run at least 3-4 miles after you wake up, regardless of speed, it brings me back to life. It's taking  4 steps back to take 5 forward. The shower afterwards is glorious.

A few people one here have stated drinking pickle juice, or eating pickles when hungover to cure it, however I found out (through many trials over the past couple weekends) that drinking it the same night that you are drinking alcohol will help to avoid having a hangover altogether. Usually I will have a shot of pickle juice after every mixed drink or shot of liquor. Haven't been hungover since I started this!

This stuff seriously works and costs about $1 a glass.  Drink it before bed and tomorrow will be a better day for you than you deserve."
"If I'm about to have a heavy night, I usually prepare a thing called a ""Hangover Kit"" and put it by my bed for use the next morning. Contents may vary, but usually include-

- paracetemol
- mini cheddars
- Kit Kat Chunky
- Blue powerade (not red, red is the devil)
- Salt n Vinegar McCoys

This usually serves until I am well enough to make it to the kitchen for scrambled eggs on toast which *should* sort it out

oh and ICE. with everything."
"Have water between drinks. Eat something before going to bed, drink 2 glasses of water and 2 aspirin. Wake up fresh like a rose. 

"
3 Advil and tons of water. Plus a one to one ratio of water to alcoholic drinks the night before, preferably between each drink
Cup of coffee, 2 Excedrin Extra Strength (thank God these are back on the market, I was dying for a year without them) and a Cajun Filet biscuit from Bojangles
I drink lots of water. I don't know how people can smoke in the morning with a hangover, whenever I wake up in someones house after a party and people are smoking it makes my stomach heave, I just want fresh air.
"Pub Coke and a raw carrot.

Has to be the watered down, iced up pub coke though. The stuff out a can or bottle have just too many bubbles to handle."
Pedialyte. It rehydrates you and replenishes electrolytes much better than water or Gatorade. Or, if it's the weekend, a Bloody Mary.
"Gatorade and Activated Charcoal Pills (can be found in the ""Natural/ Organic"" section of grocery store). I swear you will feel considerably better within 30 min. to an hour. "
spicy hot ramen/japanese noodle soup + 2 limes and Blade Runner. by the end of the movie you'll be good to go.
Rockstar(or any other energy drink) and vodka.  The Rockstar wakes you up and vodka gets rid of the headache.
"Water and fresh air. 

I just go sit outside and relax for awhile. Works best when out somewhere like a lake or in the mountains"
"Once I year I get together with my old college buddies, put on my viking hat, and drink until I fall down. Here's my hangover management technique: 

1) One liter of Pedialyte. Not Gatorade. Pedialyte. Yes, the stuff you give babies to stop them from dying of diarrhea. The Pedialtye is key. 

2) One dose of Nyquil. 

3) Time enough to sleep in the next morning. 

I'm not going to call this a ""cure,"" because the hangover still happens. It's just that you can't feel it. It's a weird sensation—you wake up pain-free but with the distinct feeling that your body is saying, ""Oh, you little fucker. I'm hanging you over so bad, and you're not even feeling it. Damn you!"" 

Of course, it only works if you do it before you go to bed. "
"I've never been able to try this, but I heard Air Force pilots cure their hangovers with straight oxygen.

My dad was a serviceman (although not much of a drinker) and he said he'd heard this too."
I grew up in a Vietnamese household, so I learned the single best way to cure a hangover is with a nice steaming bowl of Phở. It's a beef broth based noodle soup and is a delicacy in nam. 
"Lots of water before you sleep, more if you wake up in the night. 

How is everyone still having an issue with this? "
Starts the night of the drinking. 1 or 2 glasses of water before bed, and keep one by the bed for throughout the night. When i get up, nice big plate of bacon and eggs, a big ol' deposit in the toilet and a shower brings me back to life. 
"Fresh spinach with feta cheese with a soft poached egg on top. When you cut the egg open it melts the cheese and makes a really good dressing for the spinach. I've made this for years when I was working as a cook, the waitstaff were more often then not hung over.
"
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Take 2 ibuprofen with some water BEFORE you pass out.
Time machine. I just don't drink and then the hangover never existed. It's like what I did with Super Hitler.
Ramen soup!  It has electrolytes, easily digested noodles and it soothes your brain with it's warm $.25-ness!
The night before the hang over: Drink a glass of water in between each alcoholic drink. You will feel better that night and won't have much of a hang over the next day.
I don't really get hangovers, just the tired cottony mouth fuzzy headed feeling..bacon baguette, ribena and an ice lolly..never fails
"* 1 XXX Vitamin Water
* 1 5 hour energy
* 1 pack of Goody's Headache Powder

Take a couple sips of the vitamin water, dump the 5 Hour Energy into it as well as the Goody's.  Mix it up and chug it.  You will feel better."
"What if I said I have never had a hangover? At least not in the way I saw all my buddies have them. They were always totally jelly, they be mad mirin

Btw, i'm 28 and have spent a good amount of time out.

Should I go in for medical research and see if they can figure out what makes me tick?"
Everyone said water and Gatorade.  But my additional trick is moisturizer.  Before bed i put moisturizer all over my body. Alcohol dehydrates - This helps counter that and allows the water you drink to hydrate your brain more effectively.  
"The fear of being caught hungover by my parents.

I could go out to a party and get home at 2-4 am and be up by 7:30. I usually wake up take 2 Advils and drink Gatorade while trying to play it off as I wasn't drinking and got home early."
"Fats- fats are a very essential part to curing hangovers. Cowboy Bebop was an amazing anime- introducing the ""Prarie Oyster"" to me. This is a hangover cure consisting of a raw egg inside a shot of alcohol- but i doubt you'd want the taste of more alcohol during a hangover- so your best bet is eating a well balanced meal or even masturbating/sex which will increase dopamine and all that jazz(not kidding)  ALSO KEEP HYDRATED - ALCOHOL DEHYDRATES YOU water is an important factor as well"
If any of you have ever been through a hard night of drinking then woken up super early and not know why, I read somewhere (probably here on reddit ) that this happened because your blood sugar is low and its your body's attempt to fix that problem. So when I do this, I get out of bed drink a bottle of water, take an electrolyte pill and a spoonful of peanut butter. Water for the dehydration. Electrolytes for the replacement. And peanut butter will bring your blood sugar back up. I then go back to sleep and feel right as the mail when I wake up. 
"My Hangover Helper.


Directions:

Fry 3 pieces of bacon. Set aside.

Fry an egg in the bacon grease. Set aside.

Make sandwich in this order:

Bread

Cheese

Bacon

Egg

Cheese

Bread.

Fry this in remaining grease and/or olive oil. BAM. Headache gone."
This will save your life. Start with a frosted mug, put a spoonful of salt in there and cover it up with two shots of pedia-light. Crack a raw egg and drop that gooey goodness in there. Next you gotta put a half a gatorade in there because gatorade is the shit when you're hungover. Lastly fill your mug the rest of the way with some good ol fashioned H2O. Don't knock it till you try it, this has taken me from feeling like I got hit by a train to slowly regaining my equilibrium. Good stuff
I take B-complex and Vitamin C before bed with a decent amount of water. It definitely helps if you drink yourself into oblivion, and if you didn't get too obliterated, you'll wake up feeling perfectly fine.
If I can eat in the morning, my favorite place to go is this mexican food restaurant in the middle of the ghetto, because it's super authentic. It really helps when one of my friends comes along because she can translate.
Kebab before your night ends...then: I wake up early the next day, like fucking early so that I'm still tired. Then I eat buttloads of food and drink buttloads of water so that I'm uncomfortably full. Then I just go back to sleep and when I wake up the food and water has soaked up most of the alcohol (ok granted that's probably not medically sound but you get my gist). That way I don't have to really endure it, my sleep just takes care of the work for me.
Neck a couple of pints of water before bed. You will probably wake up early needing to pee, but then you can go right back to sleep and not wake up with a hangover.
"Harry, the best cure I ever came across for a hangover was raw meat, and plenty of it. You break an egg on it, add in some salted anchovies, tobasco and worsterchire sauce.

"
a tub of [this hummus](http://www.aviglatt.com/Sonny-Joe-s-Hot-Enough-Hummus-10-oz/9183/), a loaf of bread, and saturday/sunday morning cartoons. 
A breakfast sandwich or anything that includes bacon and homefries; And an arizona tall boy of any variety.
I'm a pharmacy tech, I learned early on that Vitamin B12 helps relieve those drunk symptoms so no hangover appears. Many good evenings have been had since I have learned that. 
"In college, I would take a multivitamin and drink a full glass of water before going to bed. Usually this is enough to take care of things in the morning. If this wasn't enough, then I would eat either a bowl of white rice with Sriracha OR dried seaweed OR both.

If it's just the dried seaweed, it's a bit of a gamble...if I can keep it down (a good 99% of cases), it's helps things almost immediately. If I can't, it's pretty horrible coming back up."
"When possible: Sex

When not possible: Coffee, Bob Dylan, fresh air, sunglasses, pot

Always: Water, multivitamins, sleep

Source: Alcoholic
"
Sports bottle filled with water, add two electrolyte rehydration tablets (the kind cyclists use) and a berocca. Drink some before going to sleep and finish it off when you wake up. 
Best way I have found to prevent one it taking Milk Thistle before you drink, best way to cure it eating a crap load of fast food and a shower
"Lucozade Sport, Purdeys Revitalise, Berrocca, Coca cola and weed. 

70% of the time, it works everytime. "
Water, drink a bit while your drinking and chug and water bottle before you go to bed. Works for me every time. 
Vomiting. It's not appetizing but it gets the job done. Instant headache cure and I feel like I can take on the world. Water and sleep also help. 
"Beer.

No but seriously.  Coke.  I don't remember all the biochemistry involved, but the sugar in Coke is the fastest cure for a hangover.  Put a can/bottle beside your bed before you pass out.  Try to drink it before you go to bed or take a large gulp whenever you wake up throughout the night.

Water and gatorade do not work.  "
Alka Seltzer.  Look at the symptoms its for, I'm honestly shocked that it isn't directly marketed as a hangover cure.  Pain relief, upset stomach, and you dissolve it in water so it helps to rehydrate you.  The stuff is practically made for a hangover.
coconut water hydrates you and is packed with elextrolytes, potassium and vitamin C. Alcohol still naturally needs to break down in your body and there is no way you can speed up the process I have been told but hydration is the best thing to start with. 
B12 vitamins. I take one while out and one before bed. Have never had a hangover, ever. Even after drinking two full bottles of vodka and a few beers. Maybe I'm just a superbeero. 
"Make a point to vomit before you go to sleep drunk, then drink a big glass of water. Seriously, it makes a massive difference.

Once you're up, pound more water."
"Take Vitamin B and Milk Thistle supplements with a full glass of water before you pass out.  In the morning drink more water, take more vitamins and supplements.  Also, you need sodium so have a nice salty breakfast (or lunch).

For me the worst part of a hangover is the bitter, acidic stomach.  GET BRIOSCHI from your local drug store.  It's with the antacids and has changed my life."
I usually drink a litre of water, take painkillers, and an anti-emetic then go to sleep. When I wake up in that still drunk / hungover stage I eat a piece of bread and then go back to sleep.
64-128 oz of water, 2 Excedrine Migraine, and 2 Pepto-Bismol in pill form before you go to bed (not the best for the liver, but the Pepto helps abrasive nature of the Excedrine on the stomach).
"A greasy fried egg, a few slices of toasted potato bread, paracetamol, lots of liquids, a few comedy/action movies, and some balls.

"
I usually do the following: Cut a tomato and salt it. Cut a piece of bread and devour everything with a glass of cold yoghurt. Trust me it works ;)
"Lying in bed, severely dehydrated, knowing that the dehydration is causing me immense headache but at the same time being too lazy to get up and go get water.
Then slowly waste my day trying to position my head in a way that hurts least and perhaps popping a painkiller to ease the pain. When I finally muster up the power to make it to my desk, probably call a delivery service and feel like a dirty, gross pig while eating a pizza and playing a video game."
A lot of water, scrambled egg bagel sandwich, and cuddling on the couch with my roommate's awesome dog.
Emergen-C. Hands down works every time. Also if you shop at Sam's Club there is a really good powder mix like crytal lite that's called Eco-Drink. Pretty much the same thing as Emergen-C but literally 12-16 oz of that stuff and i'm ready to roll.
"1 quart H2O
1 joint/ 2 bowls
Bloody Mary/ 2 mimosa/2 beers/sipped hair of the dog.

you need the water. the weed makes everything bearable. Add that little bit of extra poison so you don't shock the system. If you try this and life isn't better I can't help you.
"
"1.) Lots of water the night before.

2.) Advil.  3, the night before.

3.) Exercise in the morning.  Preferably surfing, if the ocean is not available, running.  This part _sucks._  But it's better than being hung all day.  And kills it fast.  "
"Alka-Seltzer! It calms your stomach, and has Asprin to help with headaches. Plus you have to drink it with water so you are hydrating yourself as well! Works like a charm :) 
http://www.alka-seltzer.com/asmr/"
"Try orange juice or anything with vitamine C. Noticed how you rarely have hangovers from cocktails and the like? That because vitamine C counteracts the alcohol drying you out. 

I tried Absinth just a week ago. It was the most embarrassing night of my life lol. I had to wake up early the next day too. It was only until I drank a freshly made glass of orange juice that I started feeling better. (special thanks to my mom who gave me this advice)"
"la croix sparkling water.
The carbonation helps your body take in the water.
Red bull= B6, B12 and Caffeine "
"Glass of water the night before.
In the morning after a cool shower, cup if orange juice with toast and whatever else you'd like.  
Couple hours after that, vitamin water."
"Normal hangover: Bottle of Pepsi and a McDonalds McGriddle meal.

Hangover ""Blackout DUB Edition"": I go to a place called T & T galley in south St. Paul and get a breakfast called The Tug. It's breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, green peppers, sausage, bacon, ham and onions all mixed together and then drowned in hollandaise. It either settles my stomach or makes me vomit horribly. Either way I end up feeling better."
Midol (I'm a man, for reference). Seriously never found a better hangover cure. Takes care of the upset stomach and headache. Wash it down with a 32oz Gatorade, sleep for another 40 minutes, and you're good to shower and start the day.
Drink water before bed, drink water when wake up, walk to gym, lift legs, sit in steam room, walk home, pass out. Best naps ever after all that shit.
water and a big breakfast n lots of food. hard to do but you'll be 100% by lunch by restoring liquid and nutrients!
"If you stop drinking by midnight... you may be able to sleep it off and wake up at a reasonable hour.

If you are so hungover you have a fever dream loop and/or you keep waking up... you may be just screwed. But if you just wake up and pound water you may make it through.

Take a shower and alternate between cold and hot water. Or just a cold shower. It only helps when you're in the shower but its not bad.

Biscuits and gravy...black coffee. Eat till you want to puke... then don't puke.

Some days you just need to sleep it off.

I personally like to have a nice black cup of coffee and just sit outside. Fresh air makes me feel better.

Oh yeah. Alka-seltzer is pretty miraculous. However aspirin makes your liver detox slower...its not exactly good for you but your liver probably isn't happy anyways.

The best if ibuprofen/advil/motrin. Tylenol/acetaminophen will make you puke. Don't take it.

However the best way is to prevent...drink lots of water while you drink and eat a solid meal beforehand."
coconut water, shit saved my life more than once. Buy 5 before a night out drinking. Drink two before you go to bed. Wake up and drink the other three if your stomach isn't dying to share last night with the porcelain god.
Never had a hangover. After a long night of drinking I cook myself a nice flank steak, put on a pair of wet socks and go to bed. 
I wake up, smoke a shit ton of weed, drink a bunch of water, slam some black coffee, and go for a run.
After drinking heavily, before you go to sleep take two activated charcoal pills and drink one or more glasses of water. If you don't have activated charcoal, toast some bread as dark as you can stand and eat that. This has worked wonders for me every time.
Two Tylenols, 1 multi-vitamin/minerals caplet, 2 big glasses of water.  It works good for a decent hangover.  For a supra hanghover, nothing will work.  I've heard about the pickle juice, never tried it.
My great grandfather's method was to have an onion sandwich and a bottle of rolling rock for breakfast. Too scared to see for myself how well it works though.
"Sleep.  That's all that I need.  When I wake up, I check my head.  If it still feels pounding in any way, I'll roll over and try to sleep more.  Wake up an hour later and repeat.    

I learned this about myself years ago, and now I know it's my drinking indicator.  If I can sleep in the next morning then I'm game.  If the following morning doesn't give me that opportunity then I'll pass the night before. Nothing worse then being hungover and actually having to move/do something."
"Hangover Remedies:

* A pint of beer and a bowl of salty cerviche
* A bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich with a cola drink
* A plate of burnt toast
* Two liters of Pedialyte or Gatorade
* Ginger
* Bloody Mary
* Two liters of coconut water
* A quick absorbing painkiller dissolved in carbonated water
* Orange Juice
* Black Coffee
* Banana
* Applesauce"
Drink a full glass of water before bed. Wake up with Bacon Egg and Cheese, OJ, Coffee, Gatorade, and pot. Done and done.
Eating a big bowl of pho. It's honestly the single most amazing thing to eat when you're drunk or hungover. The place I go to is normally open til 3am,hust enough for all the club and party goers to come in and grub. 
at my local greasy spoon:  black coffee, Big Water, mimosa, eggs benedict, side of home fries. then home for a nap
"You might get a craving for sweet stuff. For god sake don't eat any junk food. You will want
to die even more. Drink plenty of water, green tea even better. Eggs help."
"Wake up an hour earlier than usual. Struggle to the kitchen. Down a pint of water. Sleep 2 more hours. Get up. More water. Return to bed and just remain horizontal for another hour or so. Get up, get dressed and go get the greasiest breakfast/lunch I can walk to. 

My favourite hungover breakfasts are a full Ulster Fry or a Meatball Marinara footlong from Subway. That keeps me fine most of the day post drinking, until what I call the ""5 o clock shadow"". The day after drinking, you conquer your hangover for most of the day, but sometime around 5pm, sometimes 6, your body just loses energy and you slip back into exhaustion. More greasy food. "
Nothing beats a saline drip, nothing except Oxycontin, but seriously, a saline drip is the BEST hangover cure. Fifteen minutes and you are almost 100% cured.
"Grease. McDonalds, Dennys, something that's practically dripping with grease. Fixes me right up every time.

My mother swears on taking a gravol and having a milkshake. It's worked in the few times that I've tried it.

EDIT: Worst thing ever was going for legitimate Chinese food. My friend somehow thought it was a good idea, and we ended up at some legitimate Mandarin place service brains and intestines and blood and whatnot. Suffice to say it made all of us much worse."
"I take a pill called ""NAC"" (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) while I'm drinking, to avoid hangovers and liver damage. You can get some at GNC, and it is super healthy for you. It's also used to treat Tylenol overdose, so there's that too."
"Pickles. Delicious pickles. They kill a hangover fast.

My hangover sandwich is turkey, cheese, a shit ton of pickles, and ranch.

This is of course if I forgot to drink some water/propel the night before."
"In order immediately after waking up:  
Wage some war on the toilet, Shower, Breakfast Sandwich, Gatorade and going Snowboarding/Skiing.  

The first few runs are pretty miserable but after that you just start sweating all the alcohol out and riding with your buddies you can't help but feel better."
800 mg of Ibuprofen and 2 glasses of water before bed. Gatorade in the morning. Preferably on of the G Prime (G3) ones. And I take a B12 supplement pretty regularly. Seems to help.
"Not getting one.

Watch how much you drink (ideally) and drink a lot of water before bed.  I like to eat a banana too since it neutralizes the acid churning in my stomach.  Drinking can be a lot of fun but it doesn't have to hurt."
The last thing I want to do when I'm hungover is add fuel to the fire, so thinking about smoking bud always turns me off, BUT as soon as I do with some water. Nausea subsides, able to eat, and kicking myself for waiting so long. 
"I found out that alka-seltzer cures hangovers pretty easily. I once went to mexico, had a little too many ""pink panthers"". The next morning I had plans to go horse back riding with some of my friends, I was this close of skipping the daily activities when a cousin of mine recommended I take alka-seltzer. Works miracles. I recently went to Vegas and had most of my friends wake me up every night to give them my little concoction"
Prevention. When you start to slur or stumble, switch to water. Take an aspirin or ibuprofin before bed along with a big glass of water.
All these hangover cures, and no one has mentioned the best one ever. She goes by the name of Tetrahydrocannabinol. You damn kids don't know anything these days!
Lots of water before bed. Water if you ever wake up during sleep and more water when you actually wake up.
Vitamin B 12 and a Vitamin water Revive. That shit is like the legend of zelda health potion for hangovers. I always imagine the tones playing while I chug the first half of it.
"Powerade or similar with two paracetamol/ibuprofen followed by fried egg, cheddar and ketchup sandwich with a cup of coffee.
Rest on couch for a while until poison subsides.

Alternatively: shit and vomit, rest for another hour, feel fabulousy."
Try to drink lots of water before sleeping, althought sometimes to drunk to remember. I usually wake up really early after drinking for some reason, like when I stay at a friends after partying I'm always the first one awake, and if I haven't got any weed there is no chance of me going back to sleep. I drink lots and lots of water and get take a long shower (HYDRAAATE MEEEE)

*Anyone who says differently is selling something.*"
"As soon as I get home, try to drink some gatorade, a fuckton of water and 3 or 4 loaves of bread.

When I wake up, drink some more gatorade and water, plus some more bread, sugary things and salt. Your blood values will be low as shit so you need to get the glucose and salt up and running asap plus constant hydration to help your body filter the alcohol faster."
"Before bed, 2 Vitamin B-complex pills and a liter of water.
Morning, 4 Advil 200mg, a liter of water.
Bacon sandwich. 
Another liter of water.

If it's **really** bad, I hit the Orange Gatorade, Funyuns, beef jerkey and a King Cone."
Aside from the standard bread, lots of water and ibuprofen before bed...I drink like a gallon of chocolate milk the next day. Can't get enough of it! I'm convinced it's the sugars and protein that replenish me.
Pork fried rice or something with bread like a sub. Also, Gatorade, powerade or pedealyte for the dehydration. (Weed always helps to feel less dead, too)
Drink as much water as possible before you go to bed and have a gallon jug of water next to your bed, cause we've all been in that position where we feel like shit but need to get a drink of water but feel too much like shit to get out of bed to get it.
Foolproof: 2 benadryl, 2-4 ibuprofin, 1 lg. glass of water. Take all of that & pass out for 2-4 hours. Otherwise, just chug a full bottle pof Pedialyte.
"I don't know why this ""works,"" but I feel like I should be studied to find the key to a true hangover cure. I get really bad hangovers where I will wake up with a headache and vomit for hours even when I have nothing left but bile. However, if I wait until I feel so sick that I'm about to throw up and then eat McDonald's checkin nuggets or anything by Chef Boyardee, I completely quell my stomach issues. I have to force the food down and feel like I'm gonna vomit it up as I'm eating and it's an awful feeling but I never end up vomiting it and it works.

The odd thing is it has to be timed perfectly. I have woken up and been hungover and went right for the chicken nuggets BEFORE I started feeling like I was going to vomit - I ended up vomiting up the chicken nuggets. 

This generally only stops my stomach issues, but lessens my headache. It makes me feel fine enough to go hike or do something as long as it's not overly strenuous."
"eat at night and in the morning

drink water before bed

take emergen c when you wake up

smoke weed when you wake up

take a kpin or some xanax if you're into that

take a  shot of wheatgrass 

play some super ghetto music"
Immunity. As a child I had terrible migraines. Just awful. I couldn't stand them they were very painful. Nothing I've ever had from a hangover has ever compared.
Acid reducers and a glass of water the night before, sometimes a B complex vitamin as well. Then if I feel like shit the next day, a Coca cola (because the syrup is stomach settling), saltines, and some aspirin. But really, sleeping a lot will help to solve problems. 
It's all about what you do right before bed. A multivitamin, one aspirin, one Tylenol PM, and a full pint glass of water. 
"Lots of coconut water for the electrolytes. Ideally both before after sleeping.  
  
Not waking up too late, small shower and then an long walk outside. Seems to works especially well in the cold somehow. There is something about deeply inhaling very cold air into my lungs, it feels like it's healing my soul. Going outside also seems to get my body out its misery, as if your brain is saying ""holy shit you're outside now, there are people and cars and shit to avoid! No time to waste feeling shitty and sleepy!""  
  
After an hour i get back to my place, take a tylenol and sleep a bit more.  
  
This seems to work pretty well for me."
Eat three oranges, and then head out and play a round of golf in the sweltering heat. This method also improves your golf game because you are never thinking about hitting the ball. You are just thinking how bad you feel. Kinda of a two birds one stone thing. By the end of the game, no more hangover and a decent round of golf makes you feel like you accomplished something. 
Greasy breakfast food along with a Coke.  If I'm incapable of cooking myself some breakfast, I usually hit up McDonald's for a couple hashbrowns, a McMuffin/McGriddle, and a Coke.
Drink some water and go for a run. The first mile is fucking horrible. Somewhere in the second mile it breaks and I hear angels sing.
Cauliflower! Was given leftovers after a festive wedding & snacked on them the whole drive home. By time I got there I was good to go!
"I devote 45 minutes to doing nothing but drinking water and pissing before I ever go to sleep. I wake up, drink some more water and eat some eggs and/or bacon.

If i have failed at that and I end up with a hangover, then I just drink a ton of water and eat a breakfast high in protein. I avoid coffee and aspirin.

"
"I brew up a significant amount of Green and/or White tea. Has to be good loose leaf tea, so you get the most out of it. Drink until you start peeing. The antioxidants in the tea will clean you right out. 

I was working at a tea shop and figured this out from experience."
Alka-Seltzer! No joke. Pound one before bed and one in the morning. Everything is right as rain. I usually don't even need one in the morning, I just drink one for caution. 
To prevent a hangover, make sure you drink about 2 pints (~1 litre) or more of water before sleeping as a hangover is pretty much dehydration (not exactly).
Drink as much water as you can without having to throw up BEFORE you go to sleep. Anytime you wake up during the night, repeat. I've tried a lot of different methods, this is the only one that is guaranteed to work for me.
"I've got this pretty killer stuff that I used for wrestling to hydrate. It's called ""Rapid Dehydration"" and acts in a similar way to pedialite where it forces water into your cells."
super vitamin b complex before i start drinking.  it doesnt make you superman, but it curbs the hangover the next day for sure.
"Story time!

My parents went on a trip to Mexico before I was born. My dad passed out drunk, and my mom is left not knowing what to do. Mom called the front desk, and a few seconds after she hangs up, a hotel doctor shows up and signs (no english) for her to give him these red and yellow pills, and give him a sip of this liquid. She has no idea what either of these things are or do but she has no other option. Long story short my dad wakes up the next day feeling perfectly fine. They took home the medicine and for the next 5 years, whenever they had a hangover, they would take a pill and a sip of the syrup and within 15 min, they felt 100% no matter how bad the hangover was. To this day, we have no idea what was in that bottle.

**TL;DR:** Parents go to Mexico, dad passes out drunk, hotel doctor that doesn't speak English gives dad mystery medicine that cures any hangover."
"Four tums and two advil to take first thing when I wake up, with the ungodly large bucket of water to wash it all down. Then the next time you wake up you'll be feeling like a million bucks.

Drink a bunch of water before you go to bed leaving another large glass with some ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Take all when you wake up and sleep for at least a half hour. Wake up and make bacon.
"-eat greasy food

-throw up if u feel like it, just get it outta the way you'll feel so much better

-get yourself some pedialyte. you can find it in the baby area of Walmart or target. it's for babies who have diarrhea to keep them hydrated. it's like a Gatorade on steroids, it really helps the hydration

"I take Aspirin before bed to inhibit the release of Prostaglandin which causes hangovers. I drink water that night before bed and the next day so that my body doesn't have to take it from my brain and shrink it which is the main reason I get headaches from hangovers.  I would take a banana first thing before breakfast because it contains Potassium which is essential for brain, muscle, and body function so that I can get up and moving.  With that banana comes some 100% fruit juice (not fake fruit juce) because it contains Fructose which produces energy to again get me up and moving and it also increases the rate at which your body excretes the toxins.  For breakfast I need to have eggs.  It contains Cysteine which is an Amino Acid that is required in the breakdown of alcohol in order to acetate (A salt or ester of acetic acid).  The main reason is because Alcohol lowers the sodium levels in your body so I would also put a lot of salty foods in my diet the night before, and the day after.

**TL;DR:**  Aspirin & Water before bed.  Wake up, drink water, eat a banana, have a cup of real fruit juice.  Start breakfast when the energy kicks in, have shit ton of eggs and don't go easy on the salt.  As long as you had enough sleep the night before, you'll be in the mood for mountain climbing in about 3-4 hours no matter the severity of your hangover that morning."
I need to have some water right when I wake up, but when I can stomach anything my first go-to is miso soup. Warm, not too filling, the high salt content is good too. Everyone who I've told this trick ends up agreeing, and miso has yet to let hangover-me down once 
Take a multivitamin, drink water or gatorade and eat something before you go to bed. Then more gatorade in the morning. 
Coconut water. Not milk, water. Tastes like concentrated ass but will cure a hangover in under thirty minutes.
"I make a shake with honey, milk, bananas and either gatorade or powerade. I also try to have honey before I go to bed.

Aspirin usually works for a headache hangover. For a stomach hangover Throw up if it is bad enough or some saltines and powerade works well."
I hear bacon sandwiches are supposed to be great for hangovers. That being said, I wish I could function well enough while hungover to be able to cook bacon.
"I use food and drink that help clean the system and i walk it off. Lemon water with a lot of lemon in it and salad loaded with veggies like green pepper. Use vinegar and oil dressing with a lot of vinegar on it. Then go walk a mile or two. 
"
"A full English and a cup of tea with sugar in (I never take sugar normally). Then a nap after breakfast.
That's for the 'normal' hangovers, like what I had last weekend after 6 pints and no dinner. If I so much as *look* at a spirit or glass of wine at any point in my chain of pints, I will be puking from the moment I wake up until dinnertime."
Five Guys the next day. A glass of orange juice and a bottle of water before sleep the night of. Works like a charm. 
Double dose of ibuprofen, two glasses of water, smoke a bowl, go out to breakfast: large OJ, pitcher of water, coffee (black), banana, eggs, toast, pancakes/waffles soaked in maple syrup, homefries. 
"Late to the party. 2 hours sleep, Vegemite cheese toastie, and straight shot of scotch tends to do the trick. Failing that, just cook up a shit tonne of eggs with Tabasco. 

The morning shit helps a lot as well. "
"In all seriousness, there is no better hangover cure than this and works every time: Hangover from beer? Drink a beer in the morning. Whiskey? Have a glass in the morning. 

You get the point. Hangover goes away instantly. 

"
"Two options, one easier than the other, both are slightly unacceptable to some...

**Cold** gin and double tonic, preferably with a full English (unacceptable to gin purists and those who disagree with morning booze)

Medical oxygen. Turn that shit up to 15l/m and bask in pure stuff (unacceptable to your boss who finds an empty O2 bottle and to the patient who needs it)"
"milk thistle for the liver, a benzodiazapine like xanax or ativan to quell anxiety and attenuate GABA to prevent tremors, an IV saline drip or smart water and/or coconut water if that's unavailable to stabilize electrolyte levels.

A shot of green tea and hash browns from McDonalds can do wonders too.   "
Force myself to get out of bed, pound a liter of Pedialyte as quickly as possible. Follow with ice cold water, and for stomach pain I find ice cold milk is quite soothing. Also pepto bismol is amazing. A nap a couple hours after first waking up will also get you the sleep you really need.
i'm telling you all, so don't forget it. try it and be pleasantly surprised. pedialyte. its from abbott laboratories and is nothing but electrolytes. it is crazy. it is work.
"I drink an enormous amount of water, down 4 asprin, and then I get A.I.D.S. 
After Intensive Drinking Shits. 
I spend all day on the shitter in one way or another, getting those toxins out of me. As long as my headache is gone, its not that bad."
McDonald's french fries and Gatorade. Of course, this is after my vomiting marathon. Let's just say I don't drink much anymore. I'm the type who throws up and then never stops throwing up.
"Oatmeal with milk, cinnamon and maybe some honey or sugar. Two hours later I drink some chocolate milk. 

It doesn't really work."
Large cup of coffee, lots of water, long spliff, big plate of eggs, bacon & french toast. Waite about 30-60 minutes, pass the fuck out, wake up 4-5 hrs later and vuala, good as new! 
Not sure how many people can do this, but there is a Coca-Cola bottling plant in my town and friemds of mine who work swear if they are hungover they take a shot of the Coca-Cola syrup and say the headache and whatever other syptims they have are gone almost instantly
Get an I.V. You will feel better in 5 minutes. This works. I went to the hospital for a cut and I happened to also have a hangover (the two were not related). When they put in the I.V. my hangover vanished. 
Drink some coffee, water, and then jerk off. Eat a good breakfast when you get hungry. For me it's around 11 am and I have bacon, eggs, and toast. 
"Hot & dry sauna. 

Exercise (first 20 minutes is horrible after that, it helps).

Hot & dry sauna.

(If I remember, stay awake until I start to sober, then drink a lot water and take a painkiller before going to sleep).
Works every time."
Water, ginger biscuits, cup of tea, cup of tea, cup of tea. Full English with some tea. Hangover shits, accompanied with tea, for mental stability mostly.
"Best cure is prevention. Prior to drinking, take a multivitamin. Take a B-Complex supplement and or a 5 hour energy. Eat some fast food or other meal with a lot of fat/carbs. Also, stay hydrated. I cannot emphasize this one enough. Beforehand, big glass of water. While drinking, BAM. Glass of water. Makes all the difference in the world.

If you didn't do any of these prior, do them the next morning. Otherwise, drink Powerade and not Gatorade for the vitamin B. Glazes donuts are my favorite hangover breakfast.

~~another good tip: Drink Responsiby  ~~"
"Hangovers are caused by 3 things.  Dehydration.  Sugar + alcohol.  Alcohol poisoning.  

Dehydration can be fixed with water, preferably water you drank the night before.  If you drank too many sugary wine coolers the night before, you are f-cked, just sleep it off and drink some water.  

Now hangovers caused by alcohol poisoning are curable.  When i say alcohol poisoning, i am not talking about ethyl alcohol (that's the good stuff)  I am talking about the various other alcohols that are produced when it is brewed.  (Alcohol is just yeast poop, FYI)  When you drink a typical brewed beverage such as wine or beer, your body processes the ethyl alcohol first and you feel great (intoxicated).  But after the ethyl alcohol is gone, your body will start to process the other alcohols and you will feel hungover.  You can delay this hungover feeling by drinking more brewed alcohol, preferably whatever you were drinking the night before.   Your body will go back to processing the ethyl alcohol and the hangover symptoms should go away.  (This trick is known as ""Hair of the Dog"")

This trick will not work with distilled spirits such as vodka and whiskey because the bad alcohols have already been removed.  Each alcohol has a different boiling point, and this can be exploited to separate them.  As a side note, if you make moonshine incorrectly, it will contain ethyl and methyl alcohols, and the methyl alcohol is extremely poisonous. 

TL;DR  Knowing about alcohol gives you the correct tools to fight hangovers."
"Step 1: A half-shot of vodka or a glass of cranberry juice with the same amount of vodka.

Step 2: If I keep that down, a 32oz bottle of Orange-flavored Gatorade with a toasted ham and cheese sandwich.

Step 3: Take two Tylenol with another 32oz bottle of Gatorade, usually the Fruit Punch flavored one.

Step 4: Lay down on the couch and watch something that's not too noisy until I nod off.

That's for a day off, anyway. If I'm working, I just go with it because, well, it's my own damn fault and it's my punishment for drinking too much when I knew I had to work the next day."
[Cornetto works suprisingly well for me...](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lz8wvd2yyM1r0jd3uo1_500.gif)
Wake up and drink a Gatorade with a turkey sandwich with nothing spicy or much flavor. Then shit and take a shower trying to recall the night.
Not a cure per se but a multivitamin before you start drinking and another before you crash seems to minimize symptoms tremendously
"Time to toss some science out there. My friends a biochemist and we worked this one out one night. Ill trey and look for some documentation on it. 

Before I drink i take a cocktail of anti-oxidants and things know to help clean my liver out.

Milk Thistle,
Alpha Lipoic Acid,
L-Glutathione,
Vitamin b1,
Vitamin C 1000mg
(all of these can be found at your local supplement shop)

Normally taken with some green tea. After I am done drinking I down two full glasses of water and take two pills of activated charcoal to clean up all the shit I probably just put into my stomach. No matter how blitzed I get I feel like a million bucks the next morning. "
"Salt, water, protein and fat. 

For me it starts out with a bottle of water once I open my eyes. Next, I will either make breakfast or go get breakfast. Eggs and bacon (protein and fat). Lots of eggs. Lots of bacon. Also a glass (or bottle) of tomato juice (salts) w/ tabasco in it. Followed up by another bottle of water. 

If I am still feeling shitty, I will heat up a can of chicken broth (chicken noodle soup works too) and replace some more salts. And MORE WATER. 

Seems to work pretty good for me. 

"
"i prefer to take preventative measures since there is not much that makes me feel better ones im hung over.

When I drink heavy i make sure I eat something halfway into drinking and i stick to wiskey or tequila after 5 beers and I never get a hangover... i've woken up still drunk hours later but not hangover"
"Vicodin - the only cure I have ever found. That and don't eat that day or the hang over will creep back in.
"
"Multivitamin and a bottle of Powerade before bed. Another bottle + water sitting on my nightstand, drink a bit every time I wake up.  Finish whatever Powerade is leftover in the morning, take another multivitamin, eat a good breakfast.  Slightly more water than usual for the rest of the day.  I never get full-blown hangovers anymore. 

If I'm groggy, I'll take a caffeine tablet.   I can't drink coffee the morning after booze.  I'll shit a rabid fox.

If I keep waking up for non-urinary reasons, I'll eat something. "
Taking a loud, impossibly nasty shit. It works wonders if you don't hold back. You have to embrace it or it won't work. 
"leftover Chinese food, a couple of raw eggs, pizza crust and coffee grounds, all mixed up in the blender.

"
Pound a large bottle of Perrier until I throw up. It scrubs and purges all the inert bile and instantly makes me feel a million times better. It's the real deal. I came into work MASSIVELY hungover one time and my boss was laughing at me. Then I told him to just wait while I went to the bathroom with my Perrier. When I came back after hurling my guts out, I was 110% better, and my boss was genuinely blown away. I'm talking genuinely awestruck.
"Sports drink, eggs, bacon, and wheat toast.  Works like a charm every time.

Also, [Science](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/5118283/Bacon-sandwich-really-does-cure-a-hangover.html)"
Excedrin and water usually kicks the worst of it.  Going back to sleep for a little while after taking them if able usually helps too.
"[Mineral sirup.](http://www.amazon.de/Energybody-Refresh-Light-Sauerkirsch-Pack/dp/B0048DV45U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1376412035&sr=8-2&keywords=energybody+refresh+light)

This is usually a sport drink/food supplement. 1 liter of water with it, and you are fine. On severe cases, add your favorite headache pill."
Weed is literally the only thing that will ever work. Water, bacon, apples, Gatorade, tea, all bullshit. Weed is the only hang over cure that works and doesn't have negative consequences of its own. 
"If nothing to do that day,

Wake up around 6 or 7 and know I am going to feel like shit. So I take a couple good size swallows of NyQuil and go back to sleep. 2 things happen, you get some alcohol from the NyQuil that softens the effects of the hang over, and you can sleep for 6 or so more hours.

I college I use to work out, whoever said you can't sober up by sweating booze out of your system is a liar.   "
"A slurpie. Hydrates you, gives you a sugar rush, caffiene wakes you up, and it tastes awesome.

Remember to get the largest size."
I usually drink hot tea and vomit for like 4 hours. Meanwhile i lay down and watch LoL streams or Harry Potter films.
"Well, so far today, had 2 glasses water, coffee, protein shake, advil, eggs+sausage, multi-vitamin, 4 fiber pills, 10x vitamin-D, more coffee. 

Headache is gone, had 3 solid dumps, still tired, but recovering."
"Waffle House.

Double hash browns - scattered smothered covered and chunked.

Coca-cola on ice.

Bonus points if a middle aged overweight woman calls me sugar and/or sweetheart."
Drink a shit ton of water before going to bed, make sure you use the bathroom. Alcohol dehydrates your body and your brain. The headache in the morning is caused by this dehydration.
"I barely get hangovers, at all, and I drink plentifully. I just make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the night, end the night with a big huge meal, and chug a water before bed. The next morning I have a big breakfast and I feel completely fine.

tl;dr Food and water."
Where I live there are several creeks and rivers running out of the mountains and through town. In the summer, a dip in the clear, frigid water is an instant hangover cure.
Freshly ground ginger in water and then after you can keep that down a big plate of biscuits and gravy.
it starts before the hangover. pop a vitamin pill, barocca, whatever you got before going out as well as when you wake up. And water before you go out and if possible have like a 2 litre bottle sitting in your bed so you can already be fixed before it begins.
Bacon sandwich, or pho. OR pop an excedrin and an aleve, rub one out, and take a hot shower with the lights out.
"Late night diner session, followed by trying to remember to drink Gatorade before passing out/after throwing up.

A nice bowl of Shin Ramyun or pho always does wonders for me personally."
"Prevention: A large Poutine and a gallon of water.
Cure: lemonade, 1 advil, 1 tylenol and a cold shower"
"Drinking water regularly.

If you keep hydrated everyday, when you go out drinking, or are surprised drinking, you'll wake up with a reduced/nonexistent hangover. 

**Source:**I drink 3/4 gallon of water a day and never had a hangover even with my heavy drinking. "
Mixture of Gatorade and pedialyte. Sip it slowly as soon as you wake up. After about 30-60 mins, all is good. 
"Drink lots of water while drinking alcohol.  Then the next morning/afternoon, go to McD's and get two double cheeseburgers, a medium fry, and a blue Powerade.

Works like a charm."
"Preperation is best.

Drink a glass of water between every 2 or 3 drinks, drink a glass of water or gatorade before going to bed (and, if it looks like its gonna be a bad morning, you can pop an aspirin). If you wake up after 3 hours for no reason, its because of your dehydration and blood sugar, so try to drink a little bit more water/gatorade and take a spoonful of peanut butter.

Lastly, if all else fails and you wake up feeling like shit, the best cure I have seen is mixing about 3/5ths bloody mary mix (or v8, whatever you got), 1/5 beer, and 1/5 orange juice with a raw egg, then pray to whatever god you believe in and chug it. It sounds gross, but it introduces a shit load of nutrients to your body that helps speed up the healing process quickly."
"ibuprofen while drinking.
glass of water before bed.
stay awake and sober up as long as possible.

When that doesn't work:

ice pack on head.
neti pot to rehydrate.
pickle juice or bloody mary mix(without alcohol).
pot.
more sleep."
"Caffeine (Coca cola is my preference)

Something from the BRAT diet (Bananas, rice, applesauce, toast....with bacon)

Get up - sitting around just makes you think about how shitty you feel.

Finally, vomit."
Bloody Marys, a bunch of weed, a shower, sitting in pajamas and watching tv all day. mix in a little water here and there
"This is more of a healthier alternative but it works for me. I drink a kale shake after a bad hangover. I make it the day/night before and drink it whenever I can muster enough strength to get out of bed. 

Kale ingredients:
*Kale
*Spinach
*Banana 
*Cucumber 
*Avocado
*Celery 
*Frozen mixed berries
*Coconut water 
*Blend it all together

Might not be the most popular of choices but it seriously cleans your system, hydrates, and makes you somewhat functional throughout the day."
Every time I leave to go out and plan to get hammered, I make sure to leave a full glass of ice water on my counter.  That way as soon as I walk back in, I will remember to drink it before sleeping.  Wake up golden every time.
Don't get it in the first place, I have a cup of water for each shot of alcohol.  I take ibuprofen before going to bed.  I drink so much water I have to pee multiple times throughout the night but it works.
"Bacon egg and cheese on a roll, salt pepper ketchup. Large iced coffee, light and sweet. 4 ibuprofen. Consume all on a couch, preferably with an Arrested Development DVD set to ""play all"" (not too loud! that ukelele jingle will scratch the inside of my skull). "
"Lots of water after drinking and  before falling asleep. A couple advil and a bowl of some good weed when I wake up. An ice pack for my head ( for the really bad ones) Bacon, eggs, and fried potatoes to soak up whats left. by the time I finish eating I am usually feeling a whole lot better.
"
Before bed take an advil, an allergy pill and a sleeping pill and chase it with a bottle of gatorade.
Banana Bread. I've always heard how bananas restore the potassium that you lose while drinking. Also, the bread absorbs the alcohol. I drink tons of water and eat the banana bread prior to sleeping and I wake up as if nothing ever happened.
Eating balanced meals (as in Veggies, meats, eggs, etc..) and taking multivitamin (and B complex) prior to the event.  I found this awesome article like a decade ago that detailed what your body needs to process alcohol.  A hangover is your body getting low on the vital nutrients it used to process the booze.  e.g., a magnesium deficiency causes hyper sensitivity to light and sound, etc..
There's a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint up the road from me, *Papa Joe's*.  Their chicken and chorizo quesadilla is the absolute best thing ever in general, but I've yet to find something that makes me feel better on a hangover.
"My drunk self is usually really good about drinking a lot of water before going to bed.  Sure, I have to get up and piss a lot, but it helps come the morning.  

In the morning, I take a multivitamin as well as an extra vitamin B+C pill.  I drink more water and eat something with carbs, meat and a fair bit of grease.  Hangover is usually gone in a few hours."
I wake up and battle. 2 excedrin, 1 liter if water, 4 strips of bacon, 1 ibuprofen, and 2 eggs. Followed by 3 miles of running.
"Another beer.   Just one. 

If you have a wine headache, you brought that on yourself. 

The real trick is to not get a hangover to start with though.  Drink water, know when to stop and eat a little food here and there.  It goes a long way but means you can function for the next day."
A shit ton of Gatorade, forcing down a big greasy breakfast or if you're super super sick try eating peanut butter ice cream.
I have never used it but my cousin is working with some company that is making a drink for hangovers. I think the drink is called formula O2
The two cheeseburger meal from McDonald's. One of two things will happen: hangover instantly cured or puke and then your is hangover cured. This has not failed me yet.
I swear, if one person says don't get drunk in the first place I'm going out and getting a hangover just to spite them.  Yeah, that'll show 'em.  
"Drinking a large amount of water/gatorade/etc the night before. This is #1 by a LONG shot. Prevent the hangover before it starts! 

The #2 is hard work. Seriously. An hour of intense sweat it out works wonders (but it SUCKS while you are doing it, also drink water to replace sweat). 

#3 is eat something fatty and bread-y and then go back and rest for ~30 min. My fav is a spicy sausage hoagie from a local sub shop but eggs, bacon, toast and OJ (or w/e) can work too. 
"
Try to go with preventive medicine.   Two AirBorne in a pint glass of water before heading out.    Vitamin C increases liver production, and hydration is key.  One glass of water inbetween each drink.   Home, two more airborne and a pint of water; couple advil for good measure.  Oh, and don't over do alcohol.
"Right before you go to sleep: drink a pint of water, have something to eat.
When you wake up: don't lie down
do something physical.
Maybe not rugby, but that does work too"
"It's not a hangover cure, but more of a prevention.

Before you go to bed force yourself to drink 1-2 liters of water (I don't know gallons/ounces) 2-3 Tylenol or another pain killer and eat something like a few slices of bread or crackers, basically something that can absorb some of that alcohol.

You should wake up feeling mostly normal"
"More alcohol. It's it only way. Once you have a hangover, it's too late to cure.

Now, there are ways of preventing hangovers. But the only way to get rid of one once you have it is to drink more and ride it out, or not drink more and ride it out. I can tell you the former is more pleasant than the latter."
2 ibuprofen, bottle of Gatorade, bottle of YooHoo, 20 minutes of cardio, bottle of water. Feel like a champ by the end. Or like death. Depends on whether it's a liquor hangover or a wine hangover.

"I'm quite fortunate in that I rarely get hangovers that amount to anything more than feeling especially lazy for the next morning, but one thing I discovered whilst in Bangkok a couple years ago to be very helpful was a dragonfruit frappe. 

Half a dragonfruit

Sugar syrup

Crushed ice

cold water

The last thing you drink the night before should be 2 oz of [vitamins](http://www.toyourhealthcomplete.com/) and vodka or rum. Failing that 4 oz  [vitamins](http://www.toyourhealthcomplete.com/) and lots of water in the morning.
Exercise. Assuming the hangover isn't absolutely debilitating, I head to the gym and/or go for a little run. It's not exactly a cure, but it does leave me feeling a whole lot better. And don't forget the water, of course. Lots and lots of water. 
Not my personal cure because I don't really tend to experience hangovers for some odd reason, but I saw this in a Mudvayne live DVD.  Apparently they keep a stockpile of Pedialyte drinks on the bus because they kill hangovers like nobodies business.
"Vitamin Water's ""Revive"", which is kind of marked as being for hangovers, really helps for me. That, bacon sandwich, and a good poop. "
"One of my friends who studies biology told me that there are multiple factors to consider, but mainly three:

1) Hydration. Drink lots of water before, during and after you drink alcohol. Ideally you should be drinking more water than alcohol.

2) Vitamins and minerals. When you drink, you pee a lot. And when you pee, you lose a lot of vitamins and minerals, which partly causes headaches during hangover. A good way to avoid this is to buy those vitamins and minerals supplement (like Centrum). Ever since I started taking one before going to sleep and one when I wake up, my hangovers got noticeably better.

3) Sleep. Get some rest. Usually, if you were sufficiently hydrated and took you vitamins and minerals pills, you should already feel better and you probably avoided the headache. Now, all you have to do is take it easy and everything should be just fine!

Of course, there's a lot more involved, but that is the short answer and it has worked very well for me in the last few years!"
"Alkaseltzer first thing in the morning. Used to think the seltz was just for old people. Seriously, most underrated miracle drug. Headache and any lingering abdominal malaise=gone within 30 min.

In the case of a REALLY nasty hangover, however, I pop two benadryl and go back to sleep. Wake up feeling like an angel. "
I take gravol before going to bed, still hungover just not nauseous.  Then in the morning I double fist with a beer and a spicy Caesar (similar to a Bloody Mary).
Tea and watery fruit/vegetables (carrots are really good for this). You may not wake up craving them but they really work. 
A couple bacon egg and cheese sandwiches on a plain bagel, a Gatorade, and some chewing tobacco. That'll make you shit out the natty splatties. Make sure you take a shower after that shit though cause that's the only way you're cleaning your asshole completely. 
"Well first it starts the night of drinking. I try and drink at least four glasses of water before I fall asleep. With that I take two Advil or your preferred headache medicine. Make sure the room is as dark as possible for when daytime comes around. And have the biggest glass you can find full of water next to the bed. 

Pass out. 

Wake up in the morning and assess the situation. Piss/vomit as needed. More Advil more water. Go back to bed. Wake up a little later and eat a mild breakfast. Switch to Gatorade or Powerade. Something to get electrolytes and sugar back in your system. 

Bam. Don't feel like shit by like noon. 

Faster way? Drink a shit ton of water/Gatorade before bed. If you have to puke do it before you drink the water/Gatorade and take aspirin. Pass out. Wake up in the morning puke as needed. Advil, Gatorade, McDonald's French fries. No idea why it works but it does for me.




Edit: Now I have a drink that you can get shit faced off of and wake up the next day feeling fine. Vodka and water. Mixed just like a normal drink. Add a squeezed lemon and lime wedge and you can't taste the vodka. It tastes just like a glass of water with lemon and lime in it. Now I used to be a heavy drinker and when people saw me drinking this they would laugh. However we'd all get wasted but I was the one waking up feeling completely fine. "
"Hangover cure is this. One QT gadorade and a couple of advil then back to bed for an hour, wake up and eat a high protein breakfast.

usually right as rain by noon."
Not mine but my brother's: Pedialite. It has better electrolytes without all of the sugar if gatorade.
I recently came to terms with being an alcoholic and have quit drinking. It's only been a little over a week since my last drink, but it's amazing waking up without a hangover. I'm risking sounding like a douche, but the best way is prevention. However, I used to make myself throw up in the morning and it would help a bit getting whatever nasty bile had built up while sleeping. Pizza also helped.
Orange juice mixed with Gatorade while getting a blowjob. If any women don't believe me just come by and see for yourself.
Before going to bed, drunkenly drink down a glass of saltwater and eat a bananna. That and make sure you have been drinking water between alcohol during the party.
Don't go to bed pissdrunk, stay awake to sober up a bit, drink huge amounts of water and eat before sleeping. I have never had a problem with the day after.
Vicodin (kills pain and nausea, and makes you feel good), water, water, water, and some kind of physical activity in the afternoon to sweat it out.
Prevention.  Food before drinking, lots of water afterwards, and - for some, the hardest part - *moderation*.  Stretch out the drinks, intersperse them with water or lighter drinks, focus more on the social experience than on how hammered you can get as if you're racing for a record.
Powdered asprin and water before bed, and 1 packet of powdered asprin right when u wake up. It has to be powdered, I swear this is the best cure I have ever found
Trying out noises. Generally this is just me yelling or making wookie sounds. Sometimes I go with some zoidberg sounds. I have no idea why but this makes me feel less terrible. 
Water! Lots of it and Chug it.  It's surprising how many people don't do this. Very simple. I get paid to party for a living. Haven't been hungover in years. Keep a bottle next to you at night. A liter should suffice. Hell of a task to chug, but shortly after. Ready for the next day! 
pedialyte.  2.5x as strong as gatorade.  I chug half a bottle before bed and then the rest of it when i wake up the first time.  Second time I wake up I feel like a champion.
"Make friends with a nurse and have them give you an IV of saline solution. I've had many nurse friends claim this was the absolute best cure for a hangover, just not easily accessable.

"
vomiting. The only hangover symptom I get is gut rot so a nice violent vomit into a toilet really helps. I can eat and move on with my day within just a couple hours
Usually for me after a long night of drinking I get a glass, and drink about 6-7 glasses of water. I also attempt to always have gatorade laying around at home, either in powder form or in bottle. I always wake up feeling like I normally do. I do wake up in the middle of the night having to use the washroom but its well worth it in the long run.

best hangover cure is to eat 2 Aleve, guzzle as much water as you can, then sit in the bottom of the shower, lights off, with the water turned up as hot as you can take it.  Do this for 15-20 minutes, pick yourself up and go get some breakfast tacos.
water, antacid, water, asprin, more water and some rehydration salts.  When I'm then able to do so, I'll put on some shades and go find a full English breakfast.  
Here is a (HPR) Hangver Prevention Recipe: 2 pills of advil before you go to sleep, and 2 glasses of water. Go to sleep. Wake up, piss, no hang over, no headache, no thirst.
Four advil, a cup of coffee, and if you can stomach it, one of whatever you drank too much of the night before.  A double quarter pounder doesn't exactly hurt, either.
Fresh fruit, protein (eggs, bacon, sausage, or the like), followed by a 5 hr energy. Metabolizes the hangover right out and perks you up from the crappy night's sleep.
I'm not saying this is for everyone, but my cure was a month of rehab and regular AA meetings. I haven't had a hangover for four months. 
chug water/Gatorade before bed. When I wake up I make sure to drink lots, shit, piss, take a shower and do a light workout. After that im golden!
Xanax and Smart water. Seriously this is what is used in the hospital, benzos help your central nervous system relax and the smart water (saline) re hydrates you. science. 
"It's sad, but I've gotten really good at this. 

For me the biggest part of avoiding the hangover is not to cure it, but to prevent it. I put together these hangover kits for my friends when we're going to go harder than usual. 

First, hydrate. Second, eat a large absorbent (and greasy if you can manage) meal ahead of time. Take a few tums to coat the lining of your stomach and carry some with you. 

If you've got the money, these pills I take called Pretoxx are amazing. They're more like vitamins. I kind of hate to share this info because I think they're a smaller company and are often backlogged with orders. But they seriously work. (you can preorder on Amazon at the moment, I just did that yesterday)

Make sure to drink just the amount you need for the desired affect (my problem is hitting that point where I've had the perfect amount but don't realize it and just keep drinking) and always drink water in between drinks. Also I've found eating something before going to bed (like taco bell, so good when drunk) will take some of the edge off. 

Sounds like work, but if you take care of most of it while you're sober, you'll thank yourself the next day. If you didn't prep or expect to get so drunk and you're feeling like shit the next day, I've heard drinking Pedialyte is actually really helpful."
1 bottle of water. Followed by something mild to help settle the stomach. Pretzels, or a slice of pizza. Once the stomach is settled then I have half a shot of water liquor I was drinking the night before, or a beer of what I was drinking to help neutralize the headache  
I've been told Pedialyte works wonders.  The pedia pops are like otter pops, but deliciously infused with electrolytes. 
Cambells soup with gatorade to wash it down. Cambells has a really high sodium content to replace your lost salts, plus its soup so it rehydrates you also. Gatorade does the same
Don't have time to cure my hangover..usually some douchebag in our group ends up missing, and we have to spend the entire fucking day looking for that piece of shit. The first time it happened it wasn't so bad, kind of enjoyed the adventure really. The second time, shit just got weird and it wasn't as fun. It'll happen again, hopefully for the last fucking time.
"While I was in Canada a month ago I picked up some wonderful little pills called 222 over the counter for about 14 Canadian moneys. 

* 375mg aspirin
* 15mg caffeine
* 8mg codeine

"
"Vomiting repeatedly and wishing for the sweet release of death. Slowly sipping water when I feel like I possibly can without vomiting again. Sometimes crying a bit. My capacity for drink took a nosedive after I finished undergrad uni.

For less severe hangovers, painkillers, Pepsi max and carbs normally do the trick."
Prickly pear juice, [seriously it works](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-880-PRICKLY%20PEAR%20CACTUS.aspx?activeIngredientId=880&activeIngredientName=PRICKLY%20PEAR%20CACTUS)
I am one of those guys you hate for not being hung over, but love for cleaning up the day after. And that is after drinking a bottle of Vodka or whatever.
"When I was in college, my go to hangover cure was to drag myself to the Caf, get a ham and cheese omelette, cranberry juice, and a bagel with cream cheese. 

I have no idea why, but after forcing myself to eat, I felt so much better. Granted it took over an hour to get my body to want the food. 

The omelette guy, Edgar, would see me coming on Saturdays and prep my food without me even having to ask. I guess the sunglasses gave me away. "
The night before eat as much greasy food as possible, pizza or a breakfast place is always good. Won't help your weight but least you don't want to die in the morning.
"Always drink a glass of Gatorade or Powerade mixed with H2O 50/50 before you crash after drinking and eat some bread or pretzels if you can. The bread will calm your stomach and (so I hear) absorb some of the naughty chemicals and the electrolytes solution will help hydrate your body when you pass out. I personally stand by this method.

If you are asking after the fact, then my friend swears by the [prairie oyster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_oyster_%28cocktail%29) but I think this is a urban legend. "
water, saltine crackers or plain rice cakes, and sleep.  DO NOT TAKE ACETAMINOPHEN UNTIL 12 HOURS AFTER YOUR LAST DRINK.  I'd rather have a brutal headache than irreversible liver damage.  
my hangover/ partying secret is Pedialyte. it makes my hangovers practically non existent. that with a nice meal and some weed. 
"Water until my pee turns clear.
Getting laid.
And a LOT of greasy food.

It may not cure it, but I sure feel better after."
"As someone else already said, the only way to really cure a hangover is to drink a ton of water and/or gatorade before going to bed. Ideally you're switching up your booze with water while you're drinking, but no one ever does that. 

Another thing is to eat eggs, bananas, and apparently starchy white bread with bacon. A big part of the hangover is just that you're dehydrated as all hell so you just need water and salt. 

And THC also does a great job of alleviating symptoms. "
force yourself to drink as much water as possible before you go to sleep! and when you wake up. eat protein (eggs) and carbohydrates for breakfast, and a pickle. pickles help with stomach aches and hydration! happy drinking :)
"Having a drink in the morning will actually help your hangover. One of the reasons that we have trouble maintaining our balance when we're drunk is that the alcohol affects the chemistry of our inner ear and somehow (I don't remember the exact science) it throws off our balance. In the morning, when you are (probably) sober but still have some alcohol in your system, you get the reverse affect, which also causes problems with your balance and makes you nauseous (kind of like seasickness). Having a drink in the morning helps negate this imbalance and will make you feel better. 

TL:DR, Get your balance on and have a Bloody Mary."
Gatorade or Water and a multivitamin before bed, eggs for breakfast and a walk with the dog for fresh air.
"for me there's always a golden interval of opportunity where I wake up, little hungover, still a bit drunk and have the ability to eat and drink. I find if I drink a few glasses of orange juice, and eat a full cooked breakfast (bacon, eggs, sausages, black pudding, hash browns toast etc.) then go back to bed for a few hours then Im fine. Must be a combination of protein and vitamin C.

If I miss the golden interval...well then, fucked all day."
As someone who lives in Milwaukee where all we do is fucking drink 7 motha fuckin days a week , one has to have their hangover cure DOWN. If you can remember to take ibuprofen  before you pass da fuq out I would recommend that.  When you wake up drink some apple juice. Eat a BLT. And then smoke a ton of weed. Then water allllll day . 
"Perfect hangover cure. 

Chug 1 glass of water. 

Smoke a bowl. 

Sip on water. 

Smoke a cig. 
 
Sip on water. 

Poop. 

Sip on water. 

Eat. 

Shower. 

Feel amazing. "
Four advil, washed down with at least 8 oz. of orange juice.  Immediately followed by eggs and toast.  In about an hour I feel fine.
"*Raw egg, tomato juice, tobasco, shot of vodka.*

Got this from Cowboy Bebop. Its pure evil, but if you can keep it down you're golden."
Party armor. It comes in a small bottle like 5 hour energy. Loads of vitamins, no caffiene. It works wonders!
I wake up ridiculously early (8 am usually), leap out of bed feeling awesome, convince my boyfriend to come with me to the diner, order corned beef hash, eggs over easy, and fries.  Almost immediately after I eat, my hangover kicks in so I go home, climb back into bed, sleep for another 2-4 hours and wake up feeling great. 
8 ounces of heavily salted water. warm. It sucks. SUCKS. but it'll give you back all the salt you lost, you won't puke it up, and it'll make you take that awesome poop you know you need.  Then 4 more hours of sleep.
Take 2 aspirin and a ton of water right before you go to sleep.  Have yet to have a hangover cuz of it.
Pickled herring, pickled eggs or just pickles, crackers, maybe some fresh fruit if available, water or coconut water and pass out. I've trained myself to do this once I've had too much whiskey, cuts the pain in half when properly consumed.  
A Red Eye:  1 oz. vodka, 1 oz. tomato juice, 12 oz. beer (and cheap beer will do, PBR, Budweiser) Add 1 raw egg.  Chug!!
Bacon and eggs with some type of carb. I usually do over rice with Sriracha or in a sandwich with avocado and probably Sriracha. This and a bunch of yellow Gatorade. Also weed, a couple aspirin, and Netflix. If I can do all of these, then that's awesome, but usually I can only do a combination of a few. However the bacon and eggs is a must.
If you eat some bread after you're done drinking but you're still drunk you won't wake up with a hang over. 
Drink a lot of water before bed. Don't sleep in, have some coffee in the morning. Drink less next time. 
Alternate water every other drink when drinking. 1 can of coconut water when waking up. I've been crazy (read:blackout) drunk. Not one hangover my entire life.
Go grab a Bloody Mary or two. If I just get tired I'll crash until that night and wake up just fine. If I start feeling good I'll just keep going. Then repeat. Dammit.
Crack a beer as soon as you wake up, then do something that is somewhat active. Or if you live near a river or lake with a high spot to jump off of, go do that. A shot of Adrenaline will sober you up instantly.
Pickle juice. I always save it in the fridge after my pickles are gone. It helps you rehydrate quicker (I also drink water after the pickle juice) and it makes my stomach feel so much better. If you're the kind of person who usually throws up from a hangover this will help you not throw up anymore after the first time. Soooo so helpful for me. 
"banana and water before bed.  wake up, drink gatorade, drink red bull.  Sit on couch for 1 hour.  take nasty shit.  Feel good.

banana and a giant glass of ice water first, then bowl of ramen with a hint of tabasco and green tea to drink.
"Gatorade before bed and just after waking up. Went to Costco and bought a huge pack of them so I always have some on hand.

Very rarely do I have a hangover if I drink gatorade before bed, but if I do, the one in the morning knocks that shit out.

As a weapon of last resort, Chicken McNuggets. all dat grease."
On my killer drinking nights I try to finish with some junk food and a gatorade. And beer. Then next day, in a random order: pizza, coke (that soft drink), porn, simpsons/futurama/family guy/south park and a nap every hour or so. A lot of cool water helps a lot. And there you have your perfect hangover day.
If you can remember to do this, eat a spoonful or two of honey and chug some water before going to bed.  If it is severe, eating a couple more spoonfuls in the morning helps too.  The natural fructose in the honey helps the body to metabolize the alcohol much faster. 
super easy: two glasses of water with 2 spoons of honey and some lemon juice. One before going to sleep, other just after waking up. Always works like a charm. PROTIP: prepare the beverage **before** you get hammered. 
2 big glasses of water and 2 advil before bed, 2 big glasses of water and 2 advil when you wake up. sausage egg and cheese on a bagel with a big coffee, green plants and tv
Punch a bottle or 2 of water before you sleep. Get some advil and Set a timer for 5am - if you can, wake up to take Advil/mortrin and then go back to sleep. 
"Time.


It's really the only cure, and everything else is about easing the discomfort during that time, so it's best to just sleep through as much as you can of it."
Alka Seltzer. It has something for your head and your stomache... plus you put it in water and drink it so +3 DKP.
"Before I go to bed from a night of drinking I chug as much water as my body can take, usually 4-5 glasses. Then I pop some Tylenol or Advil, go to bed, wake up to pee, drink another glass or two and when I wake up I feel a bit groggy but not really ""hungover""."
A fat bowl of some sticky nug. (Marijuana). 3 friend eggs, bacon, extra bacon, everything bagel tasted with scallion creamchease and two Advil. Hangover gone in 3 hours. 
"Adderall, multivitamin, 2 bloody marys.  BAM!

Or when doing Tequila shots I like to chase them with pickle juice.  Sounds disgusting, but just fucking try it.  Destroys the burn of that cheap tequila you're drinking and you get no hangover in the morning."
6 grams of Ibuprofen, Black Coffee, and the shows as hot as it goes pounding direct on my head until the Ibuprofen kicks in.
Drink some coffee, mix emergen-c with gatoraid and drink that, get blowjob from girlfriend, smoke some weed.  In that order and hangover is gone.
For some reason, when I party I tend to wake up in about 4 hours when I go to bed. Being up at 8am, still piss drunk, you clearly want to brush your teeth and take a shower. Well, do that, because drunk showers really are the greatest invention in the god damned world but not before drinking a liter of water. When you brush your teeth, instead of using mouthwash, use Rumpleminz, rinse, swallow, repeat. Dry off, still drunk but now feeling reinvigorated instead of gross. Head out to dunkin donuts and grab a dozen donuts for all the passed out motherfuckers on your floor. Start cooking bacon and watch your zombies arise! Turn on some easy watching on the TV for them and then go out and be drunk wastes of life in the real world!
easiest way to avoid a hangover.. and this works for me 100% every time.. before you fall asleep.. chug two bottles of water. Hangovers are really easy to avoid - hydrate yourself at the end of the night. There is no other cure. this is it.

Drink a glass of water and take ibuprofen before going to bed. Sleep in, I only really get hangovers when I have to get up the next day. 
800mg Ibuprofen before bed with two glasses of water and a small snack. Repeat in morning, nap once thereafter. 
"If I have a big night. I usually force myself to be sick when I get home, or still out somewhere. I dont really care if people know ive spewed, I cop flac from it but I would rather and wake up fine maybe still tired than be shithouse sick all the. next day. 

Or my other trick is,  start drinking early in the day and get to bed early aswell. That most of the hangover has happened while your out to it..... never found that greasy foods, or Berocca work. Water does help... specially if ive gone with option one...

Cheers."
Force yourself to throw up as soon as you wake, drink 3 glasses of water with a packet of goodies powder, and eat some eggies in a basket. 
I don't use alcohol anymore, but I when I was younger I found that cannabis helped my hangover better than anything else... I had nausea & headache, & that instantly went away & I felt significantly better when I smoked some good pot. 
"In a highball glass mix: one shot of Jameson, a raw egg, and hot sauce. If you can keep it down Kiss your hangover goodbye. 
"
"The hottest pepper you can handle.  Flushes your skin, gives the stomach something else to worry about.  Or spicy greasy food, I know eating sounds bad, but you need it.

Or adderal.

Or a an IV."
I'll usually have 2 or 3 beers and get back into a drunken state.  Next, I'll have breakfast and lots of water.
What's more frustrating about this is I keep remembering being 19-23 (I'm 27 now) when I could booze it until 4 in the morning and wake up totally fine the next day like nothing happened.
"I drink a lot of water throughout the night then eat a spoonful or two of almond butter before I go to bed.

"
"Down a bottle/glass of water before you pass the fuck out.

Wake up in the morning, original V8 juice. Try and sleep it off."
Herbalife! One shot of aloe, one Herbal Tea, one Healthy Meal shake, and one pack of Hydrate. Bye bye hangover! So basically lots of vitamins...
Water. Not sparkling water. Just plain water. En masse, cures everything, especially the headache and the useless feeling atleast for me. 1-2 Liters without a break does all.
"Water every other drink. Electrolyte beverage before passing out. Either bananas or eggs for breakfast. 
"
I used to work for Starbucks and a coworker told me this but I perfected it. Order an orange mango smoothie in a venti cup with 4 scoops of matcha powder added in. Down that followed by 24oz of water. You get a whole banana's worth of potassium, which kills your headache, and the matcha is enough caffeine to bring you to alive. It comes out a weird green color, but working those 5am shifts with the worst hangovers of my life and that has always worked for me.
A pot of coffee, a 24 oz. bottle of V-8, the biggest cup I can find of Tang orange space drink, and 2 more of those big cups of ice water.
"Preemptive strike with Pedialyte. Then eat a grilled cheese and stand over the stove frying a whole package of bacon.

"Drink gatorade and/or a ton of water before bed. wake up, pop advil, shower, and then either a bacon/egg/cheese breakfast sandwich or a bacon cheeseburger and a large cola. Follow up with a monster rehab if you actually need to be somewhat coherent. 

Or there is always the lazy mans choice and simply wake up and crack a beer."
"Wake up - Drink Irn Bru (a Scottish based Soft drink which is extremely sugary), doze for 45min to an hour

Wake up again - drink some water, fire up the porn machine, bash one out, doze again for 45mins or so

Wake up again - put on Forrest Gump, pause Forrest Gump make Fried Breakfast, proceed to eat bacon egg etc while watching the film.

Done"
Tons of water, bread, and Motrin before bed, then a bath when I wake up, naps, and Gatorade. Then I have a greasy lunch, for some reason it settles my stomach. 
Ketoprofen.  Back when they sold it over the counter it was a hangover miracle.  I think it's prescription only now.
"A pint of water before bed, a poop in the morning, and a pint of strawberry milk.

If the hangover is very bad, then poop, painkillers, Irish breakfast."
Drinking as much water as I can before bed, if possible.  Then aspirin and drinking sauerkraut juice (the real, fermented, not bagged or canned kind.)  Sometimes I drink some more in the morning.  It all works well for me.
Rehydration salts.  Like, the kind they give to kids in Africa with dysentery.  I got a shit ton when I was in the Peace Corps and have been using them ever since.  Think Gatorade on steroids. 
not drinking. buuuuaaahahahahaha. No really. Pickle juice , water ,tons of aspirin and a ice pack. The best thing that works is really preventative stuff like drinking water through out the night while drinking helps.
"I learned this from a high functioning alcoholic.  Its probably too late to be see but it works
Before you sleep
* Eat a healthy meal before drinking, eat during drinking

* Drink a water every 3rd drink

* Drink water, ideally coconut water, before going to bed.  

* pepcid/antacid before going to bed

When you get up, in any order

* Drink some water

* Masturbate or sex

* Workout vigorously for 15-30 minutes (this works the best of any of them)

* hot shower

* Ice cold coke

Good orange juice and soda water. Homemade orangina. Squeeze some lemon in if at work. The tartness keeps me focused. Pound 3 or 4 in an hour and you'll get some momentum
"Seltzer water and a shot (shotglass full) of Monin syrup (or any syrup that imparts flavor). 

My apartment-mates would recommend spicy ramen. "
It really depends on the symptoms. But generally, food + vitamins + hydration and some way to ease pain if there is any. 
So surprised no one has said this! Eggs contain cysteine, which is a necessary protein for creating the enzyme that breaks down acetylaldehyde, which is what causes hangovers in the first place. The only sure fire way to beat a hangover is to get rid of the acetylaldehyde in the body. 
Last time I was hungover, my friend's Polish girlfriend made me this salty hangover soup. It did the trick
Weed literally cures hangovers then a big ass greasy breakfast. Enjoy the start of a fantastic day with no hangover.
"Lemonade.

Water for dehydration.

Sugar for energy and headache.

Lemon for the zactlys - as in ""My mouth tastes zactly like a cat pissed in an ashtray after all that partying last night. """
Weed 5 seconds before getting oral.After a good 9 hour nap and I'm good to go. Given that I've already missed everything lol
Not an instant cure, but the first thing I do is brush my teeth. My friend told me that when you wake up you still have the liquor in your teeth, and you're subconsciously tasting it. Helps a lot.
"a few bong hits, if you get high enough you'll feel less nauseous and at least eat something which helps.  Also, shittons of water! 

Best way to avoid hangover is avoid wine/liquor (IMO), higher (read: not Keystone/Busch) quality beers (yuengling+) are a little nicer on the brain the next day. "
"Pizza. seriously. Eat an entire pie of actual piza, not pizza hut or dominos, order a real cheese pie from someplace. Eat it; the whole thing (or for you weak stomached individuals, as much as you can eat before it feels like your entire body is full of pizza). This will solve all dilemmas in your stomach, provided you are not lactose intolerant. 

Consume beverages afterward as appropriate."
Honestly working out. It'll be hell but you'll sweat everything out. I know this from drinking a lot on Thursdays and then working landscaping at 7 am the next day. I feel so much better just doing stuff and sweating. But make sure to drink water too.
Motrin right after waking up with a glass of water, then once I've crawled out of bed diet coke and bananas, laying on the couch til I can make it to BK or taco bell
coconut water, hydrates and has natural minerals and shit that your body needs to clear the alcohol and shit outta your system.
"A big bottle of milkshake. Either the sugar and fat will make me feel better, or it'll make me throw up which will make me feel better.  

Alternatively, a wank. Get the blood flowing again.  

Not a great idea to combine them though."
It's like this. Water through the day. Coffee and painkillers. A chocolate bar to counter low blood sugar and fast food for the necessary glutinous digestive restorative. Trust me, I'm Irish. 
"Take some of this the night before (while drinking): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-acetylcysteine  

Essentially it assists your body with processing alcohol and getting rid of the nasty stuff it breaks down into. It does not, however, increase your tolerance or anything like that."
Take a shot of water (or any hydrating drink) with every shot/beer/mixed drink you have. Hangover is your brain having shrunk from dehydration. I haven't had a hangover in over 5 years and I'm an alcoholic. :)
"OK, I was a pro at hangovers. What I did for the better part of a decade was at night, vitamin b complex, a ton of water or Gatorade, and then an antihistamine. In the morning, an Ensure drink and Motrin.
Oh, and I always kept a nice sweet wine in the fridge to take the bite off the headache in the morning. Plum wine was a good breakfast wine. Just a few ounces will get you by."
Drink some water throughout the night, put some down before you go to bed. Drink a lot of water when you wake up and make yourself some chorizo and egg burritos. Then...more and more water. 
Bloody Mary -several of.  Multivitamin pill, Milk thistle pill and if required, something for the fucking awful headache, probably another Bloody Mary.
"Keep on drinking, just ease it off and start drinking more and more and more water and then make sure to get alot of greasy food in ya

Works like a charm for me"
Cajun hangover cute: 2 bloody marys, fried shrimp poboy, 1/2 dozen raw oysters, and a couple Midol for good measure. Works every time.
More of a prevention thing but when I wind the night down a bit slower by grabbing some 4am maccas brekky and then walking home I then nap I am usually good to go by 11
"Wake early while still drunk and not yet in pain. 
Drink water until pee runs clear. Take advil when first symptoms of hangover begin to appear and go back to bed for an hour or two. 

Wake up fresh as a Daisy. 
Every. Time. "
Eat something that's absolutely terrible for you and don't regret it. My top two recommendations are either broccoli cheddar soup in a sourdough loaf from Panera or a sandwich from Penn Station with fries.
PEDIALYTE. If you happened to not drink water or take some advil the night before, go buy pedialyte. It is used to help babies that are dehydrated from vomiting and works wonders for hangovers. It doesn't have the unnecessary sugar that Gatorade does. College and professional athletes use it, my hung over ass uses it. Pedialyte is hang-OVER. 
"Not a hangover cure but a hangover prevention.

600mg NAC Sustain and time released vitamin B-Complex before the first drink.

Another before bed, unless it's a long day/night of drinking. Then I'll take another after 4 hours and another before bed.

Amazing how well it works, whole group of friends use it.

If I need more adjusting in the am, I'll drink some pedialyte."
Before going to bed I try to eat something even if I am falling on my face drunk. Then when I wake up at 10 AM I drink 2 liters of fluids, take an aspirin and go back to bed again. When I wake up a second time at around 2 o'clock I make a huge breakfast and go about my business.
"Water.  Drink fucking water.  Going to bed?  Drink a glass.  Wake up at night to pee? Drink a glass.

Hangovers are almost always from dehydration from alcohol."
"This will be buried, but my fail safe is: Vitamin B12, B complex, D, Iron, some style of Ibuprofen, and a nice shower.

Mix a glass of 1/2 gatorade, 1/2 pedialyte (both orange flavored), then take 2 advil, a multivitamin, and chew a glucose tablet.  Then eat bacon and dry toast and go back to sleep for like 3 hours.  but that would be a worst case scenario type of thing.  
"Well, when I am out of weed and can't get more, I:

Drink alot of water before bed + Vitamen B supplement pill.  Pretty much removes all of the hangover.  Also I found strawberries help a lot the night before.   
A few good pulls from a jug of dill pickle juice followed by a couple of big glasses of ice water. Once the urghs subside from the pickle juice,  put a hurtin' on a box of freezy pops. The liquid will help hydrate you and the sugar will help with the shakes.
Need to sweat it out 3 ways. First heat, like a shower. Then spicy food, preferably a spicy soup. Then exercise. All the while drinking a lot of water.
A Bloody Mary. Or two. Maybe three. Hell, I'm already here, make it four. Well, since you asked, ok, I'll have a fifth. Six? Well I don't see the harm in that. Seven is my lucky number after all. You know what they say, eight is... One less then nine, which is only two off from eleven. And that's the story of the time that I did that thing I was talking about. Wherr all the peepol ims talkin to go?
I dont know how this isnt already on here but I just smoke a bowl of weed and boom hangover is gone all the symptoms. Even after I come down im cured.
"I drink a lot of water from the time I quit drinking to when I wake up. I eat before I pass out. Usually a burrito. Probably not great for my health, but neither is drinking. 

If I do these things, I don't get hungover. If I don't? Feels like I might die. "
Stop at walgreens and get lots of blue gatorade, stop at Winsteads and get burgers amd onion rings, then sit at home while eating/drinking/and watching netflix
Naproxen, Milk Thistle and a Zofran or Promethazine tablet for nausea. If you frequently get hangovers you are probably getting dehydrated. Sip some water while drinking, this is why I prefer drinking liquor straight up as there are less fluids in my stomach so I can consume more water. I also find that I get a more euphoric buzz if I am well hydrated.
"Big bottle of water, glass of juice or Gatorade, and a mcgriddle. Saltines and toast work if you can't keep a mcgriddle down. 

Edit: It also helps to swear you will never drink again multiple times throughout the day. "
Marijuana, a fruit smoothie, something nourishing like subway, and LOTS of water. Even if it makes you puke.
there's a restaurant I used to work at that sells enormous breakfast burritos and after a long night of drinking that is the only thing in the world I want. it's never failed to make me feel human again. 
I live in NC, and I'm sure my fellow Southerners will agree: Bojangles Cajun filet biscuit, Borounds and a sweet tea. 
Drink water and eat something before you go to bed. Also keep a glass of water beside you in case you wake up. Done. 
"To just get on with the day. Distract myself with work. Just get up, grab breakfast, and power through it. By lunch you'll be drinkin' again...


Come to think of it, that's probably the best thing. Drinking again."
Fat ass BLT and a fuckload of water. The grease will get you feeling back to normal and the water obviously re-hydrates.

Get yourself a cup of water [or some decaf tea, juice, anything that wont dehyrdrate you further] and I swear it's a 100% effective hangover cure. 

(If your hangover is really that bad, chipotle will always serve you more beer, too...)

The indigestion, and the giant spicy-dump you'll be taking on the porcelain throne later are well worth it IMHO."
"There's no cure.  If you know you have a bunch of extra alcohol in you, and it will lead to a terrible hangover...and you remember, then throw it up before passing out.
Other than that, have Tylenol and water next to your bed so whenever you first start coming to you can reach over and swallow them.  Better to do it then than three hours later."
"Am I the only one who doesn't understand why people get shit-faced every weekend? You KNOW what it's going to feel like later. Is it just because it leads to a higher chance of sex or being part of some social status?

"Step 1.  Get up.
Step 2.  Drink several glasses of ice cold water.
Step 3.  Go for an alcopoop or two.

 Repeat cycle until better."
"A pint of milk before bed, 2 pints of water next to bed (you'll wake up during sleep with a dry mouth and gulp them down, then fall asleep again). Then wake up properly (more sleep the better), take 2 or 3 paracetamols before a long hot shower (about 10 mins+), eggs and bacon with a sports drink or 2. 

Also, if you still have bad nausea and feel sick, then cut some ginger root up and eat it while sipping on an irn bru. (This step is rarely necessary, only for REAL bad hangovers)

That routine has cured every single hangover I've ever had, I've finely tuned it and it just nukes hangovers straight out of you! Its like a life cheat or soemthing"
"Depends on what I've been drinking. If it's vodka, I'll have to have liquids...so Mountain Dew and then some milk later on in the day.

Also, I have to dump a BP (Beer Poo) at some point. It smells like death but I feel like a new man after. "
A thing I always do would be to keep a bottle of water next to my bed, not a glass, a bottle, as in you drunken state you may go to grab it and spill it. But yeah, drink plenty of water. Also! a new thing my brother told me to do, pop a painkiller before you go to sleep. You wake up head ache free, trust me!
Bacon & Egg Biscuit, as greasy as possible, with a tall glass (x10) of water. Grease and eggs are miracle cures. Water is good.
Iced green tea has been my go-to since college.    A Bacon egg and cheese bagel from McDonald's is also invited to the couch party.

2) Full English Breakfast and a huge cup of tea

3) Shit

5) 2nd pint of water with a paracetamol if the hangover is really really bad"
Drink lots of water before bed, have a bottle waiting for you by your bedside for when you wake up. Eat greasy food for breakfast.
Irn Bru has never failed me yet. Plus you'll never have to worry about Malaria if you drink enough of it.
"Drink half of a 32oz gatorade before going to bed, preferably G2

Wake up an two hours before I have to actually be awake. That 3 tylenol, and brush my teeth. I don't really ever drink HFC beverages unless I goto a bar (nobody has diet 7up on the gun) and the aftertastes is gross.

Drink the rest of the gatorade whenever I wake up. I normally wake up 3-4 times a night. 

Eat something early in the day. Typically I can't stand breakfast, but eating really helps"
"The reason why you feel crappy after drinking is because the alcohol depletes your body of B vitamins. I always take 2 envelopes of ""emergenC"". and rehydrate. Korsakoff's syndrome is the result of alcoholism depletion of thiamine (b1) "
"A soft boiled egg, Marmite on toast, and a squeezed lemon wedge in iced water. 

Protein (egg), Vitamins C (lemon) & B12 (Marmite) and hydration (water).

Try to make each pint of water last 30 minutes or more, so you don't feel bloated, which will increase nausea. The B12 will help get rid of the ""oh no"" feelings of guilt & anxiety.

If you can't stand Marmite (especially when your mouth is drier than a nun's crutch), invest in a pot of Vitamin B Complex. Alcohol depletes your body's B12 reserves, which can eventually cause permanent brain damage, so it's always a Good Thing to get some B12 down your neck after a heavy session on the sauce.

McDonalds burger and fries with the largest coke possible. I do believe mcds coke has a property that cures hangovers. 
As a former bartender, a mild madras with a squeeze of hot sauce, worked every time for the staff and I, and there where a lot of times.
take a multivitamin and a bottle of water/gatorade BEFORE you pass out. it's fool proof for me assuming i wasn't too drunk to remember.
"I'm not a doctor, but...

Liquid:  Diet Coke.  The caffeine seems to help with the headache.

Food:  Pringles potato chips.  Salty and starchy, good for settling your stomach.

Aspirin:  Lots.


My personal go-to hangover cure is to swing by McDonald's and get a Filet-O-Fish sandwich.  For some reason, that (and a Diet Coke, and Aspirin) helps immensely."
I'm probably too late for this...but dragging my ass to the gym. Even 20m of light cardio and I feel 10 times better.

The minute you wake up, knock back that other Gatorade, and you're good.

When I drink I make sure every other is a glass of water or diet soda. If I get really ripped I always try to sober up at least a little before I go to sleep. The last part really helps...my personal rule is to never go to bed drunk.

"Not getting drunk. Simple.
Learn what drinks are more likely to give you a hangover and avoid them, I actually figured lager gave me hangovers so stopped drinking it, also, while drinking spirits with mixers, I only mix diet coke as it was actually the insane amount of sugar from the coke in a short period, coupled with the alcohol, which gave me bad hangovers, now I can get pretty fucked up on spirits (SoCo and dissarano are top 2) and wake up happy and lively the next day!

Water before going to bed, water when waking up the first time, water when waking up properly. Banana, orange juice, fry up doesn't matter too much.
"Greasy horrible breakfasts.  Makes the oncoming shits flow much more freely.  I remember going to some place called the streetcar cafe in new orleans after I'd gotten drunker than I've ever been.

This typically works for me and I tend to hit it pretty hard a few times a week and am in my lower 30s. Hangovers are a two day affair otherwise.

"L-cysteine. It's a non-essential amino acid that can be found in a few supplements. The most common one that comes to mind is NAC, or, N-acetyl-cysteine. When buying this you have to be careful because you can find it in two varieties: one WITH L-cysteine and one with just cysteine. You'll want the former. It can be found for fairly cheap online if you search for L-cysteine. Dosage should be 500-1000 mg every few hours starting with the first drink and finishing the night off with another dose. Water should also be consumed as it is necessary.

Here is a brief summary of why it works: Your body metabolizes alcohol into a carcinogen called acetaldehyde. This contributes to the feelings of nausea and a headache. L-cysteine has been found to not only react directly with the carcinogen to neutralize it and make it easy to remove from your body, but L-cysteine also asissts in the production of an enzyme called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase which also does the same thing.

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine#Reducing_toxic_effects_of_alcohol) is a link to a wikipedia summary to support my claims. I also did research on the energetics of this reaction and proposed a mechanism for which it takes place. I used peer reviewed journals found through the University of Washington library catalog. Unfortunately I do not have access to those anymore, so I cannot post those.

TL;DR: Take a supplement with L-cysteine in it to fix hangovers. "
I feel like a lot of people have old wives tales cures but I think the only realistic one is to drink a bottle of water before you go to bed, drink another one when you wake up, and then repeat as needed. Some tums and aspirin also help 
I have never had a hangover in my life. this might be because I never get shitfaced, but it also might be because I always have a glass of water next to my alcohol of choice. Dehydration is what makes you sick.

"In my so much less than humble opinion, if you do it right, you don't need a cure.

When you are drinking, also drink a bunch of water.  Not stupidly large amounts, we aren't looking to cause hyponatremia, but for a shot of hard liquor, you should have have an eight ounce or so glass of water (not sodas, tea, or coffees, as either the sugars, or some other aspect will cause them to help you dehydrate while hydrating you, reducing the effect.  Have some in addition, but, don't go after them as a primary source of water.)

I haven't found that eating makes THAT big a difference on whether I wake up hung over or not, though what I am drinking can make a difference.  Syrup like liqueurs are one of the things to avoid if you find that you get hung-over easily.  If your friend says that SoCo (Southern Comfort,) is a fantastic drink, sure, have a shot or two, but, don't make it your primary drink for the night.

Final bit, is try to learn your limits.  I may be happy stumbling drunk, but, I'm at home, in a controlled environment, etc, and I don't have the peer pressure of my friends around me saying ""Have another.""  If you reach the happy state, look at the time, and judge whether you really need one more drink, or if you should wait a bit and have a shot later for ""maintenance,"" rather than drinking more since ""Well, it took so long to get to this point, this shot should kick in later after the other shots wore off.""  Drinking doesn't work that way, same with your body recovering.

As for if you wake up hung-over, the only things I really can suggest is to baby yourself, and drink water regularly once more.  Feel free to drop by IHOP and order two of your favourite pancakes with bacon and an egg on the side, etc, just, be cautious, your body will possibly be more in the mood to ""get the poisons out,"" moreso than allowing nutrients in.  Listen to what your body is telling you."
"Weed.

But otherwise...I don't really have a hangover problem, my liver is top notch, but when I do need recovery it's all about V8 and ibuprofen. Ibuprofen for the immediate headache and V8 to replenish the part of your soul that almost died.

Also just drink water all night while drinking... That the only true prevention. We all know abstinence ain't gonna work

Edit: remember what you need to replenish is hydration, electrolytes (sodium, potassium), glucose and hopefully sleep."

"Eat **a lot** before you start drinking (keep ~2 hours between the eating and drinking). It works pretty well for anything stronger than beer

I'm still yet to experience a hang over, but when I'm feeling very drunk and heavy headed, I'll down a pint of water (or more) and munch through half a loaf of bread. That's probably not very healthy at all, but I always end up feeling pretty great afterwards so it works I guess.

Sleep, Advil and Gatorade. I find it works best if I take the Advil and drink a lot of Gatorade before I go to sleep. And never go to sleep drunk if you can help it.
"8 ounces of water (cold or warm, doesn't really matter) between every drink and after your last one.  The next morning, if you're still feeling it, eat a good meal and drink some gatorade, especially if you have the runs or constipation.

One of the biggest causes of the hangover is dehydration as alcohol dehydrates the hell out of you.  You can combat it by keeping hydrated during and after the drinking."
No. 1 thing for me is *lots* of water and a McDonalds Chicken McNugget meal from McDonalds. Hits the fucking spot, and cures my hangover.
My hangover cure is avoiding them in the first place. You can significantly minimize the chance of a hangover if you drink about 3 glasses of water throughout the night. Then before going to sleep drink something that has electrolytes such as coconut juice or gatorade. Then when you wake up have some more electrolytes. 85% of the time it works every time.
Drink a glass of water for every glass of beer you drink. Hangovers are caused my dehydration. Taking some vitamins helps too.
I know most people love grease when hungover but anything greasier than a slice of cheese makes me want to throw up the morning after. I usually go for subway and drink every ounce of water I can get my hands on. Then try to curl up and die.

Usually right before I'm about to call it a night, I'll take a multivitamin and some Super B-complex, and chug it down with a bottle or two of water. The best hangover cure is preventing the hangover. 
Okay first thing is to drink as much water as you can as slowly as possible and make sure it isn't cold water. If you drink too much cold water as soon as you wake up, you are almost guaranteed to throw it up. Get carbohydrate-like solid food in your stomache as soon as possible, drink Gatorade if possible and sometimes a redbull can help too. After about 3 hours after waking up from your hangover take 2 ibuprofen. If you are extremely hungover, try to sleep in or take a nap to sleep more in order to recover. Passing time is the only true hangover cure though.

I now realise that the reason why I don't get hangovers is my automatic tendency every time, to be woken up by my immeasurable thirst, and then inhale like 2L of water. Water at 4am after a heavy night of drinking is as good as sex in my book. 
2 vitamin B12's before any drinking takes place and I'm totally set for the next day. Drank tons of tequila after taking those vitamins and I was feeling awesome the next day.
On Brainiacs, they got their interns shitfaced and found a good greasy breakfast (preferably British) to be the most effective. I tend to agree.
If I know I'm going to be drinking, I'll set my alarm for about 8am. Because when I drink I'll know I'll be out till about 12pm. I'll set a powerade bottle with aspirin by my bed. When I wake up at 8 I'll go make myself throw up then take the meds and down the drink. Back to bed. When I wake up the second time I feel better than I deserve. Then I just east shit food all day
"I always try to have a friend who will force me to chug a bottle of water before I sleep and when I wake up usually a slice of pizza, garlic knots and a ginger ale followed by a trip to the bathroom does the trick.

Marijuana and Mexican Food, specifically Menudo. There's a reason they only sell it on Saturdays and Sundays: when you're that hungover, you don't care if you're eating sheeps intestine. You just want that fucking awful feeling to go away.
Life lesson learned in college: always smoke weed after drinking. I've gotten one hangover the entire year and it was because I fell asleep that night without smoking first. 
Scrambled eggs, toast, tomato juice and lots of water.  Get in the shower, dress and pretend you aren't hung over.
Bacon. 100%. Well, that and Bojangles for all my fellow southerners. I'm convinced the salt helps, although I know it doesn't. It's totally a placebo but if you convince yourself it works, it does.

Can't see half the shit at the top of this thread working, but that might just be my physiology. Bacon is suppose to be loaded with amino acids that somehow makes you feel better. I would swear by bacon every time.
"I don't get hangovers. Closest I've ever come is just waking up and not wanting to get out of my bed because I'm still tired from drinking until 5 a.m. and it's only 8:30. But hell, somebody has to cook breakfast.

If you wake up with a really bad hangover and don't have to work and or can't go back to sleep take a cap of nyquil the alcohol is enough to give you hair of the dog and the medicine knocks you out when you wake up again you should feel better.

When you get up to urinate, take a couple of ibuprofen with some extra water.
Also if you wake up at retarded AM and can't get back to sleep, carb load! Mac & cheese is the BEST but prep time is painful so just white bread or whatever you can find. Helps you get back to sleep.

Its called water or gatorade people because being hungover is mainly being dehydrated since booze is a diuretic you pee water causing dehydration so drink water or gatorade to make the hangover less painful
Two 500mg of aspirin, and three bottles of gatorade. Water works, too. Oh, and sleeping. Sleeping through the sensation of an icepick stabbing through your frontal lobe works wonders. 
Kratom. I guess it doesn't really cure the hang over but it gives me a little buzz and takes my mind off the hang over problems. Regardless of how much water and gatorade I drink or what I eat I always get that anxious shaky feeling the night after a hangover. It's my least favorite part of drinking. 
Grab a tall glass and fill it up 3/4s with Seltzer water. Cut a lemon in half and juice it out completely into the cup. add a decent amount of salt. stir it and you have a legit Colombian home remedy that works.

This post is a little old by this point, but hopefully someone sees this. A quick thing that works for me is the [Monster Rehab](http://www.monsterenergy.com/us/en/products/rehab/#!/products%3Agreen-tea) line of drinks, plus they have about 6 flavors of it. They are only 20 calories for the whole drink and have ~ 170 mg of caffeine. The real advantage though, is the tea and 'rehab' blend in the drinks. The blend is caffeine, milk thistle, glucose, black tea extract, L-carnitine, acai extract, concentrated coconut water, quercetin, guarana, inositol, glucuronolactone, goji berry extract, and mangosteen extract. I don't know why this works, but it really does for me! I frequently have hangovers as I get older and this usually does the trick.
"Drinking water after every drink.

Alternatively: Mixing Vodka with Gatorade. Get trashed on shitty vodka, and stay hydrated at the same time."
A Mexican drink known as a michelada always does the trick for me. It's basically a bloody Mary but with beer instead of vodka and a few other subtle differences. Combined with seafood it never fails to make me feel better.
Grab a gatorade,banana and take a bath for an hour or so. Not sure if you need to eat and drink in the tub but I choose to. It's helped every time I've tried it. 
Dont know if they have it outside of the UK but Barocca works incredibly well. Energy boost 2000% of your daily vitamins and it's disolved in water for hydration. Amazing stuff.
Always drink water. I glass per alcoholic beverage. Whenever I do get a hangover, I shower until the water gets too cold.
A long jog. The first few miles are awful, want to vomit every step. If I can make it to 5 miles though I'm golden.

The best way I've found, although it's bad for the liver,  is to drink a lot of water before bed.  Wake up to go pee, pop 2 paracetamol and then drink lots more water.  Wake up perfect.  However, alcohol and paracetamol together are baaaaddd for your liver. I stopped doing this now actually

I have a really great way of avoiding hangovers. My mother taught it to me, and honestly I can't remember the last time I had a hangover. I have a job that makes me work Saturdays sometimes, but usually on short notice, so I'll just be waking up when I get the call to come in to work. Needless to say, it's hard to have a good time knowing you may have to work the next day, so I used to really hold back. So anyway, the tip I use is more in preparing the drink than a after the fact kind of thing. If you ask a bartender they can make your drinks this way, at no more cost than a drink would normally be, it's really easy. Just don't drink anything with alcohol in it. Works every time, plus you won't register on breath detectors if you get pulled over! Certainly saved my bacon plenty of times.
Don't Drink :) If you do drink then I've been informed a fatty greasy breakfast always helps. It absorbs the alcohol.
Panda express, eat as much as you can until you get nauseous save it eat more 2 hours later still tastes amazing and cures the hangover every time!
I have one that you have to try to believe. But What we do is mix our drinks with Verve. It REALLY WORKS. I have like 10+ people vouch for this. Seriously though, If you want to get some pm me!
I know this is late, I'm sure its already been posted and I haven't read any of the other posts. More alcohol 
"Sounds about right. If you can even make it to one's couch. 

I often find staring at the spinning ceiling whilst reviewing my life's choices is a good start. "
I usually like to lie in the fetal position and think of the dumbest thing I did the night before, over and over again. It really helps my hungover self-esteem.
"the greatest part about this method is how happiness wells up from within like a blooming flower in the spring time after the hangover lifts.

Its like a new lease on life, twice a week!"
I hate those day long hangovers. I literally wont feel better until I fall asleep the next day and wake up.
Actually the complete opposite is the best thing you can do. I like to hit the gym while I'm still a little drunk. Get a good hard sweat going and pump the muscles for an hour or two, meanwhile chugging water from the fountain every 3 minutes and making all the girls give you stink-eye for smelling like a brewery at 9:00 AM. I'm usually feeling better a few hours later. If I just stay on the couch and watch netflix, I'll still be hungover well into monday/tuesday. 
This is what I do too but I would like to add one thing, if I may.  Have a jack.  If you can get up off the couch, go drop your load into the bathroom sink.  If not, just let it rip right there and worry about the clean-up when you're feeling better.
"Basically this, and forcing myself to vomit till I'm dry heaving.

Ideally keep your body hydrated throughout the night. Drink some water between each drink if possible. Then, yes, chug a shitload before bed. 
"This is the best advice so far.  Also add showering and liquid advil gels.

Your body absorbs water when you shower and that helps hydrate your body which helps cure your hangover.  Liquid advils are the best because your body and disgust them easier then tylenol."
All of this plus eat something and have a bowel movement before going back to sleep for 2 hours. I've done this without any water the night before and felt fine.
I recommend staying up until you pee out the first wave of Gatorade. You'll sleep a little better since you are going to bed a little less drunk, and probably won't need to pee again until the morning. 
This is close to the same process that usually works for me. Granted, if I've drank enough that night to warrant a hangover in the morning, I'm almost guaranteed to forget to drink all that water before I pass out.
And Ibuprofen before bed and when you wake up. While on vacation on a remote island I was trading my Advil Cold & Sinus straight up for Viagra with this old guy that couldnt keep up
"If I get really drunk I usually throw up the next morning. Literally anything that goes in, must come back up. So gatorade, water, anything. It sucks cos I tried gatorade after a bad experience with tequila and that is the last time I want to see that color vomit again.

"
Are you me?  I do this and have never had a hangover.  The symptoms of a hangover are those of dehydration.  Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.  I also take two tylenol with codeine and sleep in.  It has never failed me yet.  Even after getting blotto on a magnum of red wine.
I drink one coconut water before bed and two when I wake up. No hangover, ever. I spent three nights getting drunk in Vegas recently and on my last day there I chugged a few bottles of coconut water and was perfectly fine. My girlfriend, on the other hand, hates the stuff and suffered a massive hanger over.
Basically summarized to hydra yourself quickly. Gatorade/Powerade works the best I feel. Also, I like to take midnight walks and get some fresh air at one point in the night and that helps me sober up slightly before I go back to the party. 
The best advice is stop drinking at least two hours before sleep, massive fluid infusion and do it again as soon as you wake up.  Never fails.
That second pint of water after you wake up the first time; if you can pop two Alka-Seltzer in it and neck it before going back to sleep, you'll be right as rain when you wake up. But yeah, water is the answer to a hangover, both before and during.
an irishman taught me the importance of salty food consumption a few hours before drinking and occasional hydration during and for a few hours at night, you will retain water like crazy but wont get hung over.
this works everytime for me, if i understand correctly, being dehydrated is what causes you to be hungover so drinking a big glass of water before going to sleep is going to supply the hydration that your body needs over night. this remedy has helped me A LOT
This, plus a couple of aspirins before bed as well. Got me through my wedding day with flying colours :)
Even better, try to drink one glass of water for every drink you have during the night. It'll make you feel sooo much better the next day, especially if you stick to non-fruity drinks
"I finish the night off with a few rounds of  vodka and pedolight. Each round being less vodka.

It's disgusting, which is good as it makes you want to stop drinking at the end of the night. "

"This! I always make sure I chug about 3 glasses of water before I start drinking. Then while I'm drinking I'll chug one glass of water for every alcoholic drink ( I always drank liquor). Then I'd take 2 Tylenol and 2 Advil before I went to sleep. 

That being said, I haven't I haven't drank in over a year."
I just stick my head under the sink and drink as much water as I can. Try not to pass out while you do that. Almost lost a friend like that. 
I set my alarm to go off in 2-3 hour intervals with enough big glassses of water laid out in advance, before I start drinking.
"It's all about re-hydration and making sure your body doesn't shut down

* don't drink TOO much water"
"No no no, you need electrolytes.

I discovered that my hangovers weren't hangovers once, they were infact water intoxication, and that I'd given myself kidney damage.

Electrolytes will stop the mass of water rushing through and allow you to rehydrate."
"I have a note that lives next to my bed that reads ""drink this"" and I put a 1.5L water there before I go out."
"Don't drink Gatorade. It has a very high sodium(electrolyte) level and will dehydrate the fuck out of you.

"There was a quote on here the other day that went something like this:

""Tuesdays are the only day I can't justify drinking. Wednesdays I can because it's humpday and I need to make the week go by faster. Thursdays I can because it's almost the weekend and Fridays at work/school are a joke. Fridays because it's Friday and time to party. Saturday because it's the weekend. Sunday I can because I'm hungover and the next day is Monday. Monday I can because Mondays are terrible. But Tuesday, I can't justify drinking on a Tuesday."""
Due to having a lot of service industry friends, Mondays and Tuesdays are the hardest party nights of the week.
Do not underestimate a college kid's desire to drink. Tipsy Tuesdays, Wasted Wednesdays, Thirsty Thursdays, etc.
they had an article in the ny times magazine about some guy who set up hangover recovery centers and would get rich people to pay him like a 1000 bucks for a saline drip and a dark room.
"Yup! Your body has lost salt and water. This is why Gatorade and Pedialyte work so well. 

I've made salt water in the morning before. Don't forget that salt helps you RETAIN water. "
I have some friends who are... medics? coremen? in the navy, and they hooked me up with a saline drip one time after a harddddd night of partying. I'm talking we didn't go to bed until 7 or 8 and were back up by 11. I felt fantastic after!!! But I used their last one so there were about 2 people who felt great and about 10 who felt like shit... oh well!
My cousin is an EMT and brought a whole bunch of saline kits to spring break a few years back.  We hung them from the balcony above our room (we were ground floor) and worked miracles.
I have a buddy who's a Marine, he told me that the he and some other guys would sneak off base and go get shitfaced at the local bars, come back, and one of the docs would give them all a saline drip before they went to bed. Said it fixes you right up, but they kept the saline in a fridge so your body temp would drop a lot, said it was he coldest he has ever been in his life. 
I was a medic in the air force. we were doing training for a whole week, and every morning involved giving eachother IVs to get rid of our hangovers.  My personal favorite was Lactated Ringers.
Oh my god yes. Never had when hungover, but I've had two fairly bad stomach infections with nearly the same symptoms (just worse): headache, vomiting/nausea, weakness, etc. that were treated by saline drips. Amazing. Brings you right back to life. All you need is that salt water on the intravenous.
dude, I hate needles, veins and everything.... IVs freak me out, but once it's all hooked up, being hydrated intravenously feels damn good.
"My fiancé used to live in Las Vegas and his room mates were paramedics.

Yes, for the grease i always have half with bacon egg and cheese and the other half with cream cheese. it's worked every time.
My friends and I have a weekend tradition of getting pho at a really great pho place in our college town when we're really hungover...but it closed down a few months ago. :(

You can stop breathing if you mix opiates with alcohol so this is probably a bad idea. Unless you know you are not still drunk just hungover.
"Homemade milk of the poppy :

- Buy a bag of poppy seeds from the grocery store. Get the **unwashed ones**, the one that aren't all black but have bluish-white shit on the grains. This will be cheap, like less than $5 cheap.

- Take a flavorful drink, *but not your favorite one* or you may never want some again. Also, don't use something with a lot of stuff diluted in it, you need some ""solvent"" left. It could be plain water but it will taste bad tho...

- Put 1 cup of seeds in 2 cups of liquid and shake that shit like a madman for 5 minutes. (the bluish-white shit on the grains is what you want to be diluted in the liquid)

"Coconut water works for the same reason that gatorade works; it's all in the electrolytes.

Coconut water is isotonic (same salinity was  blood), so it will hydrate you in such a way that your body won't piss it all out when you drink a large amount at once (like when you're hungover).

Edit for fun fact:  Because coconut water is isotonic, it can actually be used as a plasma to replace lost blood (make sure you use the pulp-less varieties of coconut water :P)"
Coconut water is so disgusting, I don't understand how people can drink that stuff.  Different strokes I guess...
everyone hates it, but I live off that shit. It's best to drink it the day of an event you know you're going to get hammered at.

I live in Canada, and I'm always on the hunt for weird/new pops. I was in a sketchy grocery store the other day, and I saw bottles of Irn Bru for like 80 cents each. I picked up a few, and had one last night. I was pleasently surprised over how delicious it was... it was like a less intense, slightly spicy orange pop. 
Ha! Irn Bru; so much sugar, it'll melt your teeth :) I miss it. Living in the States the closest thing here is is Mountain Dew.
Wtf, wet socks!? Why would you inflict this pain on yourself? Wet socks are literally the bane of my existence.
5guys can go blow five guys. they use AMERICAN cheese on a $5+ burger and overcompensate with 47 servings of fries per order
Waaaay too much salt, that'll just dehydrate you further (especially if you eat *all* the fries, good lord).
"This works for me more than anything. 

When I'm really hungover, usually only thing in my stomach is either alcohol or bile (from throwing up EVERYTHING the night before). The ~~bad~~ worst part is I'm usually starving but the thought of food makes me nauseous.

Roll a blunt, smoke it and my appetite opens and the nausea disappears. I'll still be nursing a wicked headache but its better than a headache and nausea.  "
This actually send's my hangover into a worse state. Which is sad because I like to blaze everyday, and can't untill the night time after a night of drinking!
"Scientists have shown that there are chemicals in marijuana leaves that (potentially) help with hangovers.

Alternatively, if you don't wish or want to smoke weed (or eat weed) you can eat hemp. Hemp is relatively easy to find and contains no THC levels (What makes you high), but it does contain the chemical to help battle the hangover!"
I don't drink more than a couple of pints unless I know I have weed. I feel so sorry for people who drink alot AND don't smoke weed, that must fucking suck so hard.
"Why did I have to scroll this far down to find this?  This is be number one.

I'm not a big weed smoker, but I always keep some in the house just in case I have a hangover. Nothing works better.

I really don't buy into the ""weed=miracle drug"" line of thinking, but it honestly is amazing how well it wipes away my nausea."
"This is the most vital part of my process.

- Drink a glass of water before bed.
- Wake up early, drink another glass or 2 of water.
- Sleep for another couple hours.
- Wake up, have gatorade on deck.
- Smoke a joint (preferably indica as it fights nausea better).
- Make bacon and eggs."
My experience with weed as a hangover cure is that it can help the general shitty feeling overall but I have had times where it leaves me with the spins because the alcohol is still in my body. 
"Fat bowl, big glass of ice water, large dump, shower, a good wank, and a heaping helping of eggs. Extra points if you can pull it all off at the same time.

This is so true. It perks up your appetite and you don't feel like a piece of shit because you're stoned.
You shouldn't take acetominophen containing drugs after a night of heavy drinking. Your liver's already working overtime and acetominophen just makes it worse.

Pound a Gatorade when I wake up, then grab mcdonald's 10 piece nuggets combo when I get hungry.   All that grease is perfect for the hungover stomach."
They make seasick/car sick patches that go behind your ear.  If you can't stop puking that's the way to go.
I personally prefer pozole, because no tripe, but this right here. Its nice and greasy, gets rid of that nauseous stomach feeling.
I try to pretend but fail because I slur my words really badly when I'm hungover. It just takes so much damn effort to talk. 
"Actually this works awesome.  As soon as I start moving around and getting shit done, I instantly feel 10x better and forgot I was even hungover.  

Or you know, you could just lay around like a slob all day...  (NOT)."
No kidding on this. Pedialyte is a god send for hangovers. People always look at me weird when I tell them to stop by the wal-greens after an all night bender, but once they chug a quart and pop some ibuprofen they are automatically believers the next morning. It works better than gatorade because it has less sugar and is basically just water and a bunch of electrolytes. 
I worked for an NFL team and the players chugged Pedialytes all the time after practice, so it must be good.
Pedialyte... Basically Gatorade on steroids... drink this for pretty much everything- before sports, before drinking if I know its gonna be a long night, and every morning after drinking. 
i used to do this in college but then it translated into being completely useless all day instead of for half a day
"If you take any drug, you're going to feel better. I don't think this is very revolutionary or helpful to what you really need. ""I feel like shit, let me smoke up so being high masks my the legitimate needs of my body.""

If you're going to smoke up, at the very least drink a bunch of water so you don't start killing yourself slowly in a cycle of not taking care of yourself."
Weed makes my hangovers SOOO much worse. It makes my body so sensitive to being able to feel the shakes/muscle aches/ect.. Idk why. My friends all call me a weirdo for it but for whatever reason it makes a shitty day, a LOT shittier for me.
Yeah, is there a science behind this? In the past year, my hangovers have gotten so much worse. I'm mid 20s, and a hangover lasts all day now, instead of just the first couple hours. Is it just the slowing of your metabolism?
I forgot that I used to not get hangovers when I was younger until I took my lil brother out for his 21st. He woke up feeling dandy and I wanted to sleep all day.
Until that one night your friends push you over the edge.  Then you will almost always get them without fail.
Yeah, I've never had a hangover... Last time I drank I had 16 standard drinks over 4 hours and I woke up just fine. My fiancé constantly reminds me to stay hydrated, and always hands me a solo cup full of water after almost every drink. 
Unfortunately not true for everyone. I'm 18 and always get hangovers , even if I'm just tipsy the night before.
I think its because you have nothing to worry about, stress kills your stomach; so if you drink with an acid stomach you will probably die the next day. Plus your liver is not the same.
wait you don't get hangovers till your old? shit.. I thought i was gifted with the ability of not having hangovers.
"Before my cancer popped up I could get totally blasted and have no hangover.

I also drink a ton of water when I've been drinking a lot of alcohol though, so maybe that helps.  I tend to drink liquor, which makes me thirsty, and so drunk me seeks out non-alcoholic beverages.

This is problematic when there's nothing non-alcoholic though.  At that point I tend to fall back on cheap beer or just drinking whatever mixers people had with no liquor.  Sometimes I just keep drinking alcoholic stuff, which is bad news bears.

When I started getting sick I started reacting less well to alcohol, and after I was diagnosed I stopped drinking.  Looking forward to being able to drink once I'm done with chemo, being 21 and not being able to drink is kind of boring sometimes."

Vodka is the best alcohol for preventing a hangover. The lighter it is, the more distilled it is, and the purer form is less likely to give you a hangover. Vodka sodas (i.e., seltzer, not cola or other soft drinks) are the best mixed drink for this. Too bad they aren't the best tastewise.

FYI - Excedrine and Excedrine Migraine are exactly the same, just different marketing and higher price.  If you dont believe me, read the bottles.  
Underrated response. Pho is factually one of the best hangover cures because it restores both fluids and salts that you lose while drinking and sweating that shit out.
Gatorate 2 would probably do the same thing since it can be used instead of Pedialyte for stomach bugs, plus it's way cheaper, and tastes better.  But yeah, hydration is the key.
I don't know if I could manage squats, but there's definitely something to be said about exercising, if you can stomach it. I guess if you can't stomach it, you'll end up puking which will make you feel better too.

"Acetaminophen is down right deadly when taken with alcohol and can be bad even the next morning. Ibuprofen a risk isn't actually so much with the liver... It's more the risk of damage to the lining of your stomach. Ibuprofen is much easier on the liver but you are right that neither should be taken with alcohol in your system. Acetaminophen is much more dangerous though and I wouldn't even take it while hungover, ibuprofen is a much better choice in the morning.

And yeah, an IV drip is very fast cure because one of the main causes of a hangover is dehydration... You can only absorb so much water by drinking it, but an IV does not have that limitation... Direct injection of fluids."

What is it about a greasy, delicious breakfast that makes hangovers evaporate?  Scrambled eggs with cheese, homemade hash browns, and some sausage on the side always does it for me. 
Just curious, but why the adding of salt to the coffee? I mean I understand the body needs sodium, but the bacon might take care of that...
Yup, the right amount of water is always rather uncomfortable to drink, but it works. Sometimes, even though it is very late and I want to get in bed, I will still just goof around on the computer for a half hour or so *just* so I can drink more water.

This is similar to the Russian tradition of chasing vodka shots with a piece of pickle.  It led me to crave sauerkraut when at a certain point of drunkeness.  Good stuff.

Learned about pickle juice when I was a football manager in high school - we put it in the first aid kit for practice and games. Now if I can't eat anything else, I'll at least try to get a pickle down when hungover. 
makes sense. I always get a craving for stuff like a bacon sandwich, or even other gross greasy foods.
I used to drink tons of pickle juice before skateboarding for hours. I never knew until now why it worked so well.

used to drink moonshine and chase every shot with pickle juice. woke up like a champion. Pickle juice is delicious.
Gatorade is over-rated in terms of electrolytes but sometimes and athlete will need the sugar and will really not want to down a jug of pickle juice.  There are many things with more electrolytes including avocados and coconut milk.
But if that's true why do picklebacks make me want to kill myself in the morning? Oh, because they also grant me the accursed power of consuming 8+shots of Jameson in one hour without blinking. Right.
I've found that taking vitamins to make up for whatever it is that your body is missing helps a lot too.  Most of the hangover drinks they sell are just vitamins and caffeine anyhow.
"Mostly dehydration and if you wake up early it's because of a lack of sugar.

Always remember the water before bed and you'll wake up feeling good enough for the day.  Which means well enough to get up and get more water.

My other solution is to make sure to brush my teeth.  Once you get that horrid morning whiskey taste out of your mouth you'll fee better."
"Being drunk is dying from dehydration on a minor scale. That's why it's so helpful to drink water during (if you're responsible) and the day after you drink.

Also why people pass/black out - lack of water in addition to alcohol which absorbs what you've got left.

Also sugar! Drinking lots of sugary drinks results in a worse hangover while beer is mostly water, which helps with the dehydration (though don't count on it for all your water-y needs)"
yeah, there's been a few following-morning's where I've felt so shitty I couldn't force down too much water without puking, so I just flop in to the shower and sit there for a while. sometimes even taking a nap in there. my thought process was the same, absorbing water through your skin.
"I highly doubt that your body would absorb any significant amount of water through this method.  Do you have a source/citation for this?

Also, ibuprofen is a bad idea for anyone drinking or having recently drunk as it is a LOT harder on your liver than acetaminophen or acetylsalicylic acid. "
"most people don't know, you can get ""water poisoning"", but it does take some effort to accomplish. my standard (as a 6'4 210lb guy) is to drink at least 1.5 liters in the morning, and if I remember, like a 16-24 oz bottle of gatorade or 1 liter of water before passing out. basically, drink a bunch, but not enough to upset my tum-tum."
yeah, if I forgot I just have to make sure I drink extra when I wake up. when I pass out for the night, say at 1am, I'm a terrible sleeper. I wake up at like 6 or 7 feeling like shit. So I do the rest, but make sure to drink a little extra water or some juice and gatorade. then pass out, and still all good.

Yeah but retaining water isn't the most important reason you need it... Sodium is integral in electrical signals in our body. Used in the brain, nervous system and to contract muscles. It's fundamental to our chemical function. Potassium is it's counterpart.
Water alone is not as effective at hydration. Your body needs salt in order to be able to absorb water.

Poppy tea is essentially just team made by soaking the vegetative parts of a poppy flower in hot water after blending or chopping them up a bit, and has mild effects much the same as opium, as you are just consuming all the opiates in the flower orally.

Why? If you drink enough water before hitting the bed, you will wake up prematurely just because you have to pee (remember, alcohol makes you pee more often). Well, stumble to the toilet, pee, drink as much as you can from the tap and fall back into the bed. Easy as hell and has always worked for me.

It's the opposite for me. I always wake up early when I'm hungover and if I don't eat, drink some water, and get back to sleep, the hangover will stick around all day. The weed helps me do all of that, and the high is pretty much gone by the time I wake up the second time.

Its not that it makes you drunk faster but if you start out with something soft then end up drinking straight shots of tequila, well lets just say thats not good
I agree with this.  My brother came up with something called the gauntlet.  I drink a bottle of red wine followed by a 5th of whiskey while drink at least a six pack along side it.  As long as the whiskey isn't cheap shit I don't get anymore hung over than if I had just had whiskey alone.  I used to think that mixing drinks would bite you in the ass but after many years of experience I just don't think that's true.  Drinking too much is going to get you hungover no matter what it is.
"I think it's because with one alcohol, you can get tired of it and drink less. whereas with multiple alcohols, you get a new taste each time. 

Also you might be mixing alcohol strengths which can throw off your pacing. (""beer before liquor..."")"

The worst hangover I ever had was cured by pho.  It was really hard to eat it because I was so queasy.  I walked out of the restaurant a few times mid-meal expecting to lose it.  But after I ate enough and a little bit of time went by (20-30 mins) I felt almost normal.  It was insane.  And now pho is my go-to.

Seriously, try pho."
"In the uk. It's like our Gatorade, but it can be fizzy. Fizzy orange is best for hangovers and bangovers.

I hear it hydrates the shit out of you. I have no science to show you but I drank like 8 ounces of it when I had a massive hangover and fellt great in like 20 minutes. Downside is that it tastes terrible.

Well if we want to get TFM on the subject then lets add cocaine, slams and pledges to the mix of hangover cures. Nothing like having Toilet Seat pledge to make sure your toilet seat is warm in the morning for your early morning beer shits..
Oh I feel like I am dying every time. Afterwards, I'm feeling better and can be productive through out the rest of the day.
"Well, the exact mechanism isn't known. Ethanol and histamine share some of the same methabolic pathways, the effect may be through some form of interaction. It could also be a direct effect of antihistamines on the brain and stomach.

The symptoms of hangover was brilliantly explained by a (presumed) doctor somewhere else on this thread. On a molecular level, some symptoms occur, in part, due to histamine.

Histamine is an acute inflammatory molecule involved in allergy (as you probably know) and inflammation, but histamine receptors are found everywhere in the body, including the stomach and brain. (Many antiacids and sleeping aids act on various subtypes of histamine receptors). IN ADDITION certain alcoholic beverages (especially red wine, or certain grape species or citrous fruits) can act as histamine releasers, wich explain why some individuals get an instant headache after drinking wine (or even a rash- common with the malbec grape)

Long story short: the mechanism is unknown, but histamin is a player in hangover. Antagonizing histamine ameliorates (at least for me) hangover, probably by either interfering with alcohol metabolism or by blocking the effect of histamine released by (certain types of) alcohol or both.

"Your body can't absorb water without electrolytes, if it can't absorb it because of the electrolyte levels, the next option is to dump it as quickly as possible so that precious electrolytes aren't depleted causing your muscles (including your heart) to sieze up.

That is like secondary school science"
"A combination of your excretory system and hormones.  In normal excretion, a filter in your kidney is permeable to small things such as ions, water, and waste products. Well, as it goes through the kidney, water is reabsorbed through osmosis, and later ions are reabsorbed by the concentration gradient set up by the said osmosis.  This process of retention allows you to concentrate your urine with toxins and excess products.


When alcohol is in your system, it acts against vasopressin, or ADH.  This hormone is released by the posterior pituitary in your brain and is secreted when your blood volume is too low, or your blood pressure is too low, thus, causing water reabsorption.  Since alcohol represses this hormone, then you end up not retaining the water that your normally would, which explains why you pee more when you are drunk as well.  Since your urine has high water content, the ions follow.  

Electrolytes thus serve to allow more water to be reabsorbed by osmosis and diffusion.  This isn't a full explanation, but its basically along those lines..."

cheap beer is the WORST for hangovers.  a few years ago for new years, my friend and i split a case of clear creek ice (6,2% ice beer that sold for $12 for a 24 can cube and tasted terrible).  Since it was new years, i also mixed champagne and hard liquor. by far the worst hangover i have ever had.  After that night, i decided dirt cheap beer just wasn't worth it.

Try a handful of Tylenol or Aspirin then -- this was my point -- they don't attack your liver in the same manner as ibuprofen/Advil.
I usually take 2 or 3 tops, and spread out the dosage, maybe 1 or 2 more at least 4 hours later. Take too much at once and you can hear your living crying.
I believe ibuprofen would be safer though. But then again you're still alive so yeah. 3-4 times a year might not be that bad..

"Even though what you said makes sense based on osmosis and osmotic pressure, none of those Wikipedia articles say anything that directly supports your statement.

edit: I think osmotic pressure actually supports the opposite... if you have cells in 100% water, they'll absorb the water faster than if they were in 95% water. Something like that is why salt water actually dehydrates you. So when you add salts, there is less than 100% water, so it's not absorbed as well."

Either you're pretty young or you've never gotten to that .20 BAC type of drunk. Used to only get hangovers on the latter, now that I'm older pretty much any night of heavier drinking I won't be fully recovered until the next night or even a full day afterwards.

I feel that this is the case. When I was younger, I never got hangovers, but I also had a MUCH lower tolerance. I would only have 4-5 drinks in a night and be fairly drunk. Now I'll easily drink 10+ drinks and I get terrible day-long hangovers.

When I mix beer, liquor, and wine, even if its a relatively ""small"" amount considering it is spread out during a whole night, I **will** puke a **lot** the next morning.  

From direct experience, I've split a 30 case of Natty with a friend before.  Needless to say I was very close to blackout drunk, but just had a terrible headache the next day (and terrible beer shits).  Nothing some Alka Seltzer and tons of water can't fix before lunch. However, it was nothing in comparison to the morning after I had one Busch heavy, one shot of Jose, a glass of red Franzia, Absolut and cranberry, and an irish car bomb, all over the course of about 5 hours. Fuck me sideways; I could barely *move* the next morning without retching. I had to lay perfectly still very slowly sipping water out of a straw to get some fluids back in me.  Any quick movements (rolling from my side to my back) would make me puke 2 minutes later.  This happened later when mixing a similar batch of alcohol.  

Mixing plays a HUGE roll.  "
Yet everybody's body is different.  Anyone I know that has mixed different types of alcohol in the night has different results.
"Alcohol is alcohol.  The chemicals, sugars, different flavours etc they come in will all react differently.

Why is it that I am the most happy drunk ever(Rum, Vodka, Whiskey, Bourbon, Beer), but the moment I touch Gin, I want to sit in the corner and cry? 

I don't get severe hangovers, but when I'm drinking at home (usually a spirit) and then head to a bar to continue drinking all night (Beer), I will come home with a much more severe hangover than if I'd stayed at home drinking until the same time.

Studies Schmuddies.  I know my own body."
Probably true. But, in general if I get moderately drunk off just rum, I will feel a lot better in the morning than if I had rum, beer, wine, etc. all else being equal.
It's a bitch of a gamble. But sometimes I figure if I'm at work anyway, I can't sleep there so sometimes it's just worth it!

A coworker of mine sells jars of homemade pickles. Every couple of weeks, she comes in with a new batch and all of the sudden the entire office is drinking the juice right out of the jar. It's fucking weird but yes, I could see someone picking pickle juice over gatorade. 
I don't get hangovers dude(tte). Atleast not in the conventional sense. I just have this weird tummy feeling, but other than that I'm more fresh on a day after drinking than a usual work day. No headaches or anything. Therefore I don't need pickle juice or gatorade. Besides if gatorade is just brine, doesn't that do more harm than good? Just get those ORS sachets from a chemist or pharmacist. They're dirt cheap. Definately cheaper than Gatorade or buying pickles.
Your body can absorb the water, but it will dump as much of it to reduce damage if your electrolytes are low, which, if you drink a lot of water (even tap water) will be the case. Particularly if you downed it.

"No... Mixing does NOT play a huge role.

This myth has been long since debunked.

I noticed that the drinks you mentioned that gave you a hard hangover is very tannin-intensive; Jose (Anejo tequila has tannins), Franzia (Red wine is THE WORST for hangovers, because of it's tannin content), vodka cranberry (cranberry juice has lots of tannins, hence the bitter-astringent taste), irish car bomb (tannins are why guinness is so dark and bitter).  ALL of these are the kind of drinks that give the worst hangovers, so I'm not surprised you had a bad morning.  However, the fact that you were mixing your drinks played no role in your hangover.

That 30 case of Natural Light?  Yeah, not a tannin-rich beer... not going to be THAT bad of a hangover. "

I gotta be to work at 7, so I spend the next three hours trying to forget the fact my cats (also from the divorce) puked in the hallway and if I go clean it up I'll feel like they're watching and judging me, like I'm beneath them because when I come home from my 12 hour shift of kissing ass in a job that, in all honesty, needs to be eliminated due to uselessness, I'm going to come and those asshole cats will have puked in my chair. I'll spend the rest of the day after that on the internet pretending other Redditors give half a shit about what I have to say as if it's as valid replacement for social interaction even though it really isn't, all while I down just enough beer and liqour to knock myself out until 330 the next morning to repeat the cycle until one day, half an hour into my 45 minute commute to my shitty job, I just let go of the steering wheel and press on the gas, hoping that my piece of shit car won't stall out before it hits a tree at a speed that will ensure a quick and welcome death.

This is purely dependent on the amount of ice you put in. I prefer scotch on the rocks, but my idea of on the rocks is 3 small ice cubes. It doesn't make your pallet cold enough to numb your taste.

"Most people are saying drink water while you drink alcohol. That's true, that's your best option for hangover prevention. But since you asked about a cure once you already have a hangover, Pedialyte.

Pedialyte is the drink they give kids when they're sick and need to replenish electrolytes.

"You get hungover because you are dehydrated. If you start drinking at the start of the evening and you keep going until you get home at midnight-1-2-3am that's essentially a whole work shift worth of running around and going bar to bar and drinking alcohol while not drinking water, that alone is enough to dehydrate a person, not to mention the fact that while you were doing that you probably peed like 4-10 times, because as far as your body is concerned alcohol is a poison and it is trying to flush it from your system, which further dehydrates you. 

Simply drinking water during drinking, and before you go to bed, will be the most effective way to combat hangovers. Although once you are already hungover, that doesn't do much for you, so you best bet is to drink as much water as you can hold, you may throw up a few times, but once you can hold down some water, smoke a J or ideally a dab, that deals with the headache and nausea, and restores your appetite, now you can go grab some greasy breakfast food and then you should be back to 80-90% of normal functioning"
Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup). Order the rare steak kind prior to going out drinking so you have it at home already prepared so your drunk ass just has to microwave it.

"Asking how you can 'fix' a hangover is like [asking you how can fix a car that has run out of fuel](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3xezry/what_are_some_ways_to_fix_a_car_that_has_run_out/). The answer in the second case is obvious and the advice is always ""don't let it do that.""

The very simplified explanation is body processes alcohol in two steps. 
1) Use some stored chemicals to turn Alcohol into Ethanal (Ethanol => Ethanal) 
2) Used some different stored chemicals to turn Ethanal to Pee. (Ethanal => Acetates)

A hangover is what happens when your run of the stored chemicals in step 2. It's an empty gas tank.

Ethanal is a natural irritant. If you don't get rid of it quickly it starts to make you all puffy and bothered. Your liver can process it quickly unless it runs out of gas. In which case it sticks around and starts reking your day. 

So if you're out of gas, what do you do?

You can fill up the gas tank very, very quickly by going to a hospital and getting an IV drip with lactated Ringer's solution. Combined with some headache pills, vitamins, and electrolytes you can be back to functional in about 30 minutes and $200.

The other option is get your body to regenerate these chemicals naturally (time) or to prepare yourself beforehand by loading up on the chemicals before going out (putting more fuel in the tank). Water is one of those chemicals by the way.

For some [complex metabolic pathway](http://imgur.com/2bgKYp3) reasons, you can't get the chemical that breaks down Ethanal directly. You need to get the chemicals which your body uses to make the chemical which it uses to break down Ethanal. You can get these at Whole Foods for $5. There are a bunch of molecules that help break down Ethanal but in practice the ones you need are made using ""N-Acetyl Cysteine"" (NAC) and Glutathione. Take maybe 1000mg of ""NAC"" depending on body weight and make sure your body is hydrated. [You can cause liver damage if you wait until you are already hungover before taking those](http://sph.ahmu.edu.cn/toxicology/data/upfile/1/files/1208/1_12080910200318.pdf) so be careful and stay away from anything that is marketed as a 'hangover cure' that comes in a 5-hour energy style bottle. They're fine to have *before* you start drinking, not after.

Those same chemicals you use to process Ethanal are used to process sugar. If you drink sugary alcohol drinks you are essentially burning double. It's why people say they get worse hangovers from sugary drinks - it's because it uses up your bodies store of fuel faster and you run empty sooner. One sugary drink is like two normal drinks."

staying hydrated is the key, but you also piss out a lot of the salts your body needs so unless you are drinking gatorade or something similar during the night lick a little bit of salt, wash it down with some water. it helps to retain some of the lost salts in your body, works well for me, hardly ever get hangovers now that i started doing this.

"I have a secret recipe for hangovers that has never failed me: 

1. Before you go out drinking go to CVS or Walgrees or Wegmans or where ever the fuck you buy medicine and buy a liter of Pedialyte. (Grape flavor is the best) 

2. While you're at the pharmacy pick up a bottle of Alleve. Make sure it's Alleve. Don't get anything with Acetominphen in it because that shit can fuck up your liver permanently. If they don't have Alleve at your pharmacy then you need to find a new pharmacy. Once you get home put the Pedialyte in the fridge to chill. Unbox the Alleve and put the bottle right next to it so you don't have to go looking for it in the morning when you can only open one eye. 

3. Commence to drinking. Try to hydrate as you drink, a glass of water for every one or two beers/drinks. Also, don't buy cheap well alcohol or sweet mixed drinks. Those give you the worst hangovers.

3. Before bed try and drink another glass of water - at least 16 oz is helpful here (or a pint for you non-Americans). This may not always go over well, but give it a shot. 

5. Set your alarm for three hours before you have to get up. This is important. You're going to hate yourself when the alarm goes off, but the booze rooster will probably wake you up around the same time anyway, so just do it. 

6. When the alarm goes off stumble the fuck out of bed and drag your ass to the kitchen and crack the Pedialyte and down as much of it as you can. See those Alleve next to the Pedialyte? Take one or two with a few swigs. 

7. Smack your knees on the coffee table while stumbling back to bed, or step on the cat, or figure out who that is sleeping next to you. This step is optional, just make sure you get back in bed. 

8. Go back to sleep for three hours. 

When you wake up you're probably not going to feel like a million bucks, but you'll feel better than you would if you hadn't done any hangover prep at all. 

<<BONUS ROUND>> Find a Mexican food restaurant and order the spiciest breakfast you can and wash it down with a Coca-Cola.

"Benzos. Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Ativan, etc. Wake up in the middle of the night and chug pedialyte. When you wake up in the morning, chug more pedialyte and pop some Valium or something.

This actually works. If I had access to everything in the world, I'd treat hangovers with an IV saline drip, benzos, and pedialyte.

Why does this work so well? Because it's hair of the dog, without the dehydration and without the delayed hangover. Benzos are what hospitals give you for alcohol detox, as they work on the same receptors that alcohol does, but they don't dehydrate you at all. "
Can of sprite, two paracetamol (acetaminophen for you US folks) and a hearty breakfast. The most important is the can of sprite.
This [burrito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY2KxtF0LDE) is a miracle. Plus It's the only thing that my wife can cook that is actually not terrible.
Ibuprofen and copeous amounts of pedialite or Gatorade the night before. First choice though, especially the morning after is an IV.
First is water obvs. Or ice with your drink (some of you may disagree) but ice in your cider makes it last longer and you're getting water in. Also ice with your spirits like scotch or bourbon, no not in it you animal! Another glass with it to crush or suck on. For me though, Pears. Have always helped not sure why. Or I hear cocaine but I haven't tried that one so can't vow for it myself.
I try to have a bottle of Gatorade or something like it for the morning afterwards. Does the trick for me.
"Last weekend I discovered this. If available, shove some snow in your mouth.

I was so hungover every time I ate I threw it up. On the way home from the cabin we were at we had to stop so I could throw up in the blizzard.

I shoved snow my mouth, holy shit I was good as new. The water hydrated me, the cold cleared my sinuses and helped with the nausea. 10/10 wpuld frantically eat snow to heal my body."
Back in the tropics we got [King Coconut] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_coconut) the water in is really good and tastes good cure for hangovers.. Also i m in North America now, back during my clubbing days I used to drink gatorade once I got home after clubbing and drinking no hangovers in the morning..
I don't get hangovers from a typical drunken night. Only time I ever get them is if I have drunk adhd where I hop from whisky to gin to beer back to whisky then to a rum and coke and finishing my night with various different ipa's. When I get a hangover though pickle juice is the shit for knocking it the fuck out. 
"generally more sleep, I normally always wake up 3/4 hours after going to bed then can't get back to sleep but those days that I do. Generally some food and water sort me out
"
"The recipe for rehydration salts:

One liter of water, six teaspoons of sugar, half teaspoon of salt. 

Chug it after a night of drinking, no hangover, guaranteed."
"I always found pickles to be a great hangover cure.  They're salty to restore your electrolytes and help you retain water.  You ever notice how you feel like something salty/greasy in the morning, it's because you peed it all away. They're like 98% water themselves so they hydrate you as well.  They're low in calories, taste great and give your stomach a ""full"" feeling while being digested too."
EGGS! They're easy on your stomach and they have a substance called cysteine that breaks down the toxin acetaldehyde (which is part of what causes hangovers). This is a true life saver. [Sauce](http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/drugs-alcohol/hangover6.htm)
i usually just force myself to eat something nice and greasy and drink some water and/or gatorade. Also, drinking sprite or ginger ale when i am hungover usually makes me feel better.
I always drink pickle juice followed by a multi-vitamin. Take a big gulp of pickle juice right before bed and if you get up to use the bathroom during the night. A lot of the time when I'm drinking whiskey I'll take pickleback's: shot o' whiskey immediately followed with a pickle juice chaser. 
A little bit of alcohol. A doctor recently explained to me that a hangover is a symptom of mild withdrawal from alcohol. 
"NAC just before drinking. It's a precursor to glutathione which is the body's major antioxident. Drinking greatly reduces your body's supply, and this depletion is one of the core causes  behind that general feeling of shittness after drinking. NAC helps spike glutathione just before you deplete it.

about 1g of vitamin c before, and some activated charcoal after drinking also greatly reduces hangover. (don't use charcoal with NAC though, it fucks up its absorbtion)"
"Eggs. 

I cook 3 eggs before I go to bed, and chug 2 glasses of water. Whenever I have that combo, I wake up with only a mild headache at most. 

Just... Double check you turned the stove off.. And if you're way too drunk.. A shitty next day does not outweigh burning your house down.. So.. Fry more responsibly than you're drinking. "
Something that works wonders for me is that before I go to bed after a heavy night of drinking is to drink an entire bottle of water before I sleep and take two advils. You wake up hydrated which negates a lot of the hangover, if it doesn't already get rid of it completely. 
"Bananas and gatorade always work well.

But back in the day the best thing was to eat something super greasy when you wake up. It helped, always. No clue why this worked, we always figured it had something to do with the grease preventing the alcohol from actually touching your stomach lining (though in my old age that doesn't sound right). There's also a good chance greasy food is going to evacuate your body quicker, taking the alcohol with it."
More of a prophylactic, drink one of those electrolyte replacement pills at the start of the night, usually prevents throbbing headaches when you wake up. Great for people who drink a lot of whiskey.
The best way to treat a hangover is to prevent it. I always drink bottles of water while I'm drinking alcohol - reallllly helps.
Alka Seltzer works wonders for nausea and headache. Follow that up with gatorade and a little physical exertion (fast walk, moving some stuff around, etc) and you're golden.
Spending a few hours curled up in the fetal position on your couch, with constant fear that you're going to throw up, all while regretting your decisions from the previous night is my foolproof hangover cure.
"Banana Bag, straight to the vein.

Thats what we give patients anyway. It's just fluids, multivitamin, thiamin and folic acid. If you have those in pill form and can keep it all down.... you should be set."
Ginger, carrot and watermelon all blended up I was told by a wise man during my leavers/schoolies/graduation celebrations is the best cure for a hangover. Worked pretty well actually. 
There's a drink called Life Support that a lot of people I know swear by it. Never tried it since it's kind of expensive. $20 for 4 on Amazon.
anything fatty the next day does the trick... If your in the UK all day breakfast works a treat especially eggs and that stuff 
"Pedialyte, almost all electrolytes and the more you want it the better it tastes.

"Before bed: Liter of water

After waking up, in this order: Liter of water, 2 advil, multivitamin, masturbate, take shower, get dressed (dress like you'd be leaving the house, even if you don't have to), breakfast burrito, red bull/coffee, liter of water.

Good as new."
"soak your feet in warm water, then put on a wet pair of socks. over those put on a pair of dry wool socks and go to sleep. While you're sleeping your body will force circulation down to warm up your feet, kind of 'flushing' your body. This does not help with dehydration though, so yeah pedialyte.

Also have a light snack before you go to sleep, it can help absorb some alcohol and replace salt in your body.

In the morning, physical activity can help tremendously. I know its the last thing you want to do but going to the gym or even a brisk walk can help. Follow with a cold/hot shower and you're good to go!

When all else fails, weed food sleep."
"Damn i'm probably too late already and this may be a bit /r/halicorporate but I swear to you 5 hour energy is amazing when it comes to hangovers. Drink it just as you start partaking in the alcohol or roughly around 5 hours before you plan on going to bed.

Honestly I'm pretty sure its because of all the vitamins in that thing, but mostly vitamin B12. So alternately you could take a B12 pill with lots of water before bed that works for me as well."
Personally, I have a can of coconut water before bed, and in the morning. Has never not worked for me.
When you finish drinking for the night before you go to sleep take 4 Advil and drink an entire pint glass of water. You'll wake up feeling fine. 
"Run a 5k.  New Year's Eve one year I had a bit too much.  The next morning at 10AM I had a ""Resolution Run"" 5k.  I was very hungover (and still drunk) when I started the race.  When I finished 45 minutes later, I felt much better. "
I used to chug a beer first thing in the morning. Then throughout the day I used to chug water. It always seemed to help me. But then again I was once an alcoholic.... 
"My process:

- Start the night with a glass of whole milk

- Each time you have to pee, take a 10 second chug of water from the faucet

- Try to stick to beer and avoid sugary beverages

- Count your shots and plan on a glass of water per shot

- Chug a Gatorade before bed

- If you wake up to pee, chug water from the faucet

- Immediately upon waking, chug more Gatorade, brush your teeth, shower

- Eat within an hour of waking up and you're good to go; else, go back to sleep

- Or, fuck all this, do what you want, and wake up with some push-ups or a run till you vomit

Cheers."
"Prevention: Stay hydrated while drinking. 

Cure (based on my experiences): Coffee and a nice greasy meal such as a pizza, Chinese food, a burger, fries. Then a nap. Exercise. 
"
2 pints of water, one to down before you go to sleep. One for the bedside table. In the morning, bacon lettuce and tomato on very very well done toast. Force it down and follow it up with an ice cold lucozade. 
"Pedialyte, one of the best fixes ever.
Drink a glass before bed and you'll wake up feeilng 100% refreshed."
"When your body starts to dehydrate, it's REALLY important for your brain to maintain it's regular pressure and hydration, so your body produces amino acids to draw the usual amount of water into your brain and keep it happy. 

When you wake up the next morning and chug 3 glasses of water, these amino acids are still there and pull the water into your brain via osmosis and you get a nasty headache. 

Obviously the best cure is to drink water through the evening you drink so you don't become dehydrated, but if you forget, when you wake up it's best to reintroduce the water slowly to let the amino acids dissipate. 

At least, that's what one of my biology professors told me. I don't have a full source for it but biologically speaking it makes sense to me."
I'm currently in med school and when on tour (i.e. pretty much drinking for X number of days straight) with the hockey team (field not ice), the fourth and fifth year students have IV bags which they hook each other up with on the side of the pitch as a hangover is just a lack of fluid and electrolytes. Just remember to strap it to your back. 
Sausage, egg, and swiss cheese on a hard roll with mustard and worcestershire.  Halfway through you will take a monster shit and you'll be fine for the rest of the day. 
If you wake up and keep drinking you will delay your hangover. But you will eventually get something known as the fear. The fear is what I think minor withdrawal feels like. When you close your eyes you see faces, you sweat a lot and swap between being really hot and really cold. It's bad really really bad. But for a cure just drink water and try to sleep through it. 
Okay I know how to kick headaches after drinking, how do I cure the nasty stomach that comes after a night of drinking?
Hangovers seem to be triggered primarily by having an excessive amount of drinks that contain alcohol the prior evening.  Drinking beverages with a much lower or missing alcohol content tends to dramatically cut down on hangovers.
I think most people know these, it's implementing them that becomes the issue.  If you drink you are going to have a hangover, and the only cure is time.  You can do various things to help reduce the severity but overall you'll have to deal with feeling like shit for a little while.  I've found (as many have already stated) water while drinking and before bed is one of the best and then Pedialyte and a banana in the morning.  Eggs and home fries are also excellent, but it all depends on if my stomach wants them.  My eyes certainly do. 
"1. Gatorade/Water

2. Salty and fatty food and a litre of water before bed. (salted peanuts are my go to)

3. Pedialyte"
"Water and time.  Food(especially greasy food which makes it worse), pain relievers, and weed only distract you from the symptoms.  
When you get home after a long night, chug a bottle of water before crashing and chug another when you wake up.  Hydration is the name of the game. All the time."
Scrapple egg and cheese, on a donut with a quart of cool blue gatorade. Supper fucking greasy and it tastes damn good too.
"A bit late on the thread, but some people can suffer from mild hypoglycemia from drinking. Eating a bit of sugar before/after bed can help to counter nausea and restlessness.

"If you are positive about having a hangover the next day, take some ibuprofen and omeprazol right BEFORE you are going to sleep. Down it with a full glass of a drink with lots of sugar in it, for example, a big glass of coke. The next morning you'll still feel like crap but at least your head and stomach won't hurt.

Ive heard there is new hangover patches you put on your arm right before drinking, some people say they work wonders.
Switchel. It's a drink made from apple cider vinager, ginger, and a sweetener (honey, agave, etc.) Mountain men used to drink it because it's packed with nutrients and prevents dehydration. You can make it at home and it's amazing.
Nachos. A big plate of nachos the morning after has saved me from many a hangover, except the time it turned out my hangover was actually morning sickness and the nachos came back up. They tasted the same coming up as they did going down so that was a bonus.
An athletic performance supplement company named Advocare makes two products called spark and rehydrate I used for baseball. If you drink it when you wake up hungover, you feel almost 100% again in about 20 to 30 mins. It's the best I've found by far, way better than Pedialyte. 
Sunday afternoon golf. I throw that on, lay on the couch and enjoy my recovery. There is never anything loud, all soft spoken and light clapping at most. You can doze out for long period of time, wake back up and not feel like you missed anything.
Gatorade! No matter if during or after your drunk & feeling shitty, it'll have you up & around within 20 minutes of finishing one of their 32oz drinks. Has never failed me in all these years of boozing..
Honestly if you are doing the thing where you are throwing up the next day a fuck ton, if you walk outside and get some fresh air it helps immenseley
Coke from a fast food place, usually McDonald's or Subway. I don't even know why, but if I'm hungover I can easily chug a large Coke and it goes down a treat. I've recommended it to people and they have also agreed.
"Eat marmite (or equivalent) on toast. It contains vitamin B1, also known as thiamine:

Vitamin B1 or Thiamine: Thiamine helps prevent the buildup of glutarate in the brain, which may be associated with part of the headache associated with a hangover. Other B vitamins are depleted when you drink, so taking a B vitamin complex may be beneficial.

4. Drink a bottle of water
5. Profit."
"If you take two ibuprofen or aspirin before bed, your headaches shouldn't be as bad. Get a glass of water, take the pills.

Midol. I'm surprised no one has said this yet. When I feel like I've been hit by the whiskey train I ask my girlfriend for a dose. It's caffeine, muscle relaxant and painkiller. That plus water is a godsend.

Bacon/Egg/Cheese sandwich on toast with a cup of coffee then go for a walk. This cures to the highest degree possible except the debilitating, vomiting types.
Not really a cure, but more of a preventative measure. Drink nightly. A couple pints, or a bottle of wine with dinner, whatever you enjoy. Match to your tolerance level and build it up so it doesn't get you drunk. Then on a night when you exceed recommended daily intake, you'll barely notice the hang over. I used to get the worst ones when I was younger. Now through the miracle of constant low-level alcohol saturation, it is difficult to get drunk or hung over.  
I have a friend who is in med and they can hook up an IV to you the next day when you have a killer hangover. It works every time. 
"B12!!!!!      What the hell is going on in this thread?  I've read EVERY SINGLE COMMENT and only found ONE (half-assed) mention of B12!!!  B12 is soooooo much better than ANY of the remedies in the comments.  Get the kind of B12 that dissolves under your tongue, take 3-4 of those before bed.....you'll wake up feeling better than you can possibly imagine!  In fact, I usually wake up 2-3 hours earlier than normal and I'm ready to rock!
If you forget to take B-12 before bed, then your best bet in the morning is weed followed by greasy breakfast & some multi-vitamins, accompanied by ONE or TWO alcoholic beverages.

Dihydromyricetin is a type of flavonoid that had a lot of beneficial effects. It improves the effectiveness of the enzymes that breakdown acetaldehyde, a byproduct of alcohol breakdown that causes a lot of hangover symptoms. 

It also interferes with alcohols ability to interact with GABA in the brain, which means if you take it while drunk it will make you feel not drunk anymore (your blood alcohol level will not change), eliminating slurred speech, dizziness, and lack of motor coordination. Taken before bed it helps prevent the symptoms caused by lack of GABA and increased glutamate production, namely being able to fall asleep but not stay asleep or poor quality sleep. 

It is also hepatoprotective, it protects the liver from some of the damage of alcohol use. 

[This link explains DHM an its benefits in much greater depth including research study links.](http://hangovercure.org/dihydromyricetin/dihydromyricetin-ultimate-guide/)


TL;DR: Take DHM after a night a drinking to significantly reduce or even eliminate many of the symptoms of a hangover, plus it helps protect your liver.

"Taking a painkiller before you go to sleep prevents you from waking up with the initial headache. Combine this with hydralite (that's what we call it in Australia but it's what you take to replace electrolytes) essentially it's a more concentrated Gatorade.

Have some tonic water after or during your drinking especially if you are drinking on an empty stomach. I was so glad my dad used to be an alcoholic the first time i got really wasted. I was black out drunk on an empty stomach and thanks to this i woke up without even a minor headache and just threw up twice.
I usually do at least 2 glasses of water and 4 ibuprofen (800mg is basically what a doctor would prescribe). As far as after, Pho, eat Pho, that shit will cure anything.

Klonopin. It affects the same area of your brain as alcohol, so it's like hair of the dog without actually drinking more. Super helpful during the work week. 
A pint of water, with 2 solpadine, a dioralyte and a barocca. Drink it as quickly as possible, try not to puke it up, if you succeed you'll be brand new in 15 mins. Failing that, more booze really does help (short term).
"Hang overs are primarily the cause of two thing: dehydration and inflammation. Alcohol is an anti-antidiuretic hormone. Meaning it makes your pee out a lot more water than you normally would. So make sure you drink extra water while ""getting drunk"". If you make the water 0.86% NaCl (table salt) or lower you will retain the water better. The 2nd part is to take an *anti-inflammatory drug*, (over the counter headache medicine) as you go to bed. DO NOT take an blood thinner, alcohol is already a blood thinner. This is by far the best way to prevent a hangover. To get ride of one do the same thing, just add some kind of hearty food, like beef or eggs. "

"-Phase one of the hangover cure begins before you start drinking. Hydrate and eat carb heavy meals.  

-Phase two of the hangover prevention/cure occurs while you drink. Have a glass of water every few hours, or more frequently depending on how fast or long you are drinking.

-Phase three occurs when you are finished drinking for the night.  You want to drink another glass of water or gatorade or some hydrating beverage. 

-Phase four occurs when you wake up to piss at some random point in the morning.  Take excedrine and go back to sleep.

-Phase five occurs when you wake up for the day.  Take a multi vitamin, drink coffee, and drink water/hydrating beverage.  Bonus: smoke some weed to help your stomach out.  But don't be fooled by your new found well being, because it can go as quick as it came.  Don't immediately start doing a lot of stuff because the bowl you smoked has you feeling like you're fine.  You are not out of the woods and that hangover could come roaring back at any time.

Eat an avocado(Guac works) before you drink. It contains an antidiuretic hormone, and will cause you to retain water. When you wake up the next day you will feel better, because you won't be dehydrated.

L-theanine is an amino acid found in small amounts in green tea; however, you would need about 10 cups of green tea all at once to reach a worthwhile dose of theanine, so for the purposes of this post, I'll be referring to concentrated l-theanine pills. One thing that it does (I forget exactly how) is it increases the rate at which the body clears acetaldehyde, the most harmful byproduct of drinking created by the metabolism of ethanol. Acetaldehyde is actually the main cause of hangovers (I recently watched a BBC documentary that, in part, investigated what causes hangovers, and the conclusion was that acetaldehyde plays a *much* larger part in causing hangovers than dehydration; notice how hangovers get worse and last longer as you age? That's because your body gets slower at and less capable of removing acetaldehyde from your system when you get older.), so eliminating it more quickly will have you feeling better faster. Taking 100-200 mg at night after drinking (and as much in the morning if you still feel shitty) *will* remove the biochemical reason for your hangover. 

L-theanine is actually the closest thing to a miracle drug that I could think of. Its main purpose is to ameliorate the negative effects of caffeine (anxiety, jitters, etc.) while slightly boosting the positive ones (mood, focus, energy). It also reduces anxiety in general and relaxes the user without causing drowsiness. It has also been demonstrated (in a few select animal models) to increase BDNF, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is one of the substances used by the brain in growing new neurons and synapses between neurons. There is no known amount that would cause overdose, it is not toxic in large doses even over long periods of time, and it has virtually no side effects. (Taking a lot at once, like 600 mg or more, may lead to a bit of sleepiness, but that's it.)

If you're interested in purchasing theanine, I will give this warning for the millionth time: *do not* buy dietary, vitamin, or mineral supplements from major retailers. Due to a lack of FDA regulation on supplements, often the chemicals in the bottle are not what they should be. Buying supplements from a trusted source--Swanson is always who I recommend--is a much safer bet, because many of their products are third-party tested for purity and potency. In terms of l-theanine, there is a particular maker of it (""Suntheanine"") who is reliable. Any bottle of l-theanine with Suntheanine's name on it is a safe bet, no matter where you get it. 

Minor edit for clarity"
Sadly, in my experience, people dont know that if you hydrate and drink a lot of water, thats the best cure/prevention of a hangover. 
A cold can of Coke, must be exactly that temp, measurement and container. No more no less. It truly is my nuka cola for AP regeneration irl, oh an a joint with it is a nice perk.
If you wake up with a throbbing headache and nausea a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar will take the sick feeling away almost immediately. You can mix it with 8 oz of water to dilute it or take a straight shot. It works for me every time.
"Before bed - chug a glass of water and as much of a Gatorade as you can.  

When you wake up - finish the Gatorade and more water, then get some food into your stomach."
Drink water as you're drinking the alcohol. Learned this a few years back on New Years Eve. Being hungover is basically you being extremely dehydrated, so if you're chugging a glass/bottle of water every so often throughout the night, your body won't be dehydrated when you wake up, which will result in little to no hangover. Been doing this ever since and saves me every damn time.

Drink a glass of water and take an Aspirin before bed. Pain sensitizes the nerves and increases the pain, so fighting the pain before it even starts is the way to go.
I'm sure a lot of people do already know, but for those that don't: FUCKING COCONUT WATER. I don't really care for the taste, but wow will you feel a million times better. Also fried eggs on toast. Those three things combined are my go-to hangover breakfast.
Pretty sure Sprite or 7up is the best cure I know. I think I even read an article that stated it had some scientific basis that it reduced hangover symptoms.
"Drink a giant glass of water before bed and take a multivitamin.  Then in the morning, drink another giant glass of water.

Also, a bowl of spicy pho is the ultimate cure. "
As difficult as it can be to motivate yourself to do it in the first place, going to the gym often leaves me feeling very fresh afterwards. 
Prairie oyster: raw egg, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, salt and pepper. Sounds counterintuitive but it works sometimes  
If you out-drink your hydration:  EXERCISE! (while hydrating)  Whether that be hiking, having sex, going for a run, swimming in the ocean, snowboarding; Whatever you can!  The sweating and aerobics will turn your blood over faster and you'll start to feel better.  It's just matter of overcoming the initial painful inertia...  
raw chicken livers always did it for me. Soon as you stumble out of bed eat 2 of those and your good to go.
"Well other than not drinking yourself into a stupor.  Drink plenty of water whilst drinking alcohol.  Then the next day drink some gatorade/lucozade to help rehydrate you.

"
Just wake up at a reasonable time. It's going to suck but it's much better than ruining your sleep schedule / weekend.
"1. Wake up, drink glass of water. And brush teeth.
2. Shower.
3. Another glass of water followed by cup of coffee or a red bull."
"My preventative measures work pretty well:

- drink shitloads of water while drinking.

- eat a modest pre-bed meal that's high fat/protein and low carb.

- pound water before bed. 

- girls, do yourself a favor and take off your makeup. Seriously, waking up with last nights make up just makes everything feel worse. Wear comfy clothes to sleep if possible.

- in the morning: if you wake up DONT GO BACK TO SLEEP YET! You're most likely still sorta drunk, this is your time to strike! Get up, take a shower, pee, pound more water, pop an Advil/ibuprofen to combat the headache.

- now you may go back to sleep, and when you wake up again you'll start your day as if you didn't hate fuck your liver last night.

- eat something high fat/low carb again in be morning.
"
"Jesus Christ you all are so dumb just drink water WHILE drinking and you'll be fine. Lots of water! That's the only ""cure!"""
"N-A-C or N-acetyl cystine is a precursor to Glutathione the antioxidant responsible for breaking up the toxins that cause the hangover headache. When your glutathione levels drop so does your ability to break up acetaldehyde. This is solves the problem by giving your body the resources to produce more Glutathione through N-A-C.

So some N-A-C and some water works wonders. Don't have the cash to drop on Pedialyte as mentioned in this thread? Just put a pinch of sea salt in your water. Coconut water works too."
A buddy of mine chugs Pedialyte before bed, has for 10 years, swears by it... not the cheapest remedy though...
"Any type of canned soup or instant noodles. Way easy to prepare, and it provides you with water and sodium to rehydrate you.
Optional : Crack an egg into your instant noodles and bam, you got some protein to get you going."
"You really have to have a whole routine. 

1. Smoke weed.
2. If stomach still upset, drink carbonated beverage
3. Eat greasy breakfast
3. Take shower (this is important, opens up all the pores clogged with alcohol by products).
4. Nap"
Me and my friends swear by greasy food. I was skeptical at first and I didn't really feel like eating greasy food while hungover, the thought of it made me sick, but then I tried it. Wow felt like a whole new man. 
A lot of the effects are due to dehydration.  Get some water in you, preferably before you go to bed and you will either avoid the hangover entirely or make it a lot better.
"My dad, who I would describe as a professional drinker, told early on not to drink anything sweet, like rum and Coke or margaritas. I also stopped drinking any hard liquor and stick only to beer, and I drink water as well when I'm drinking more than usual. I pretty much never get hangovers, but I understand that beer drinking isn't what a lot of people mean by ""drinking."" 

Edit: My dad also told me to eat something reasonably heavy before drinking, something with some fat in it. "
"When I was a freshman in college (also before the days of absolutely debilitating hangovers), I would chug about a gallon of water and take 3 ibuprofen before passing out. If that didn't keep the hangover from happening, my follow up was to mix a Zip Fizz energy powder (they boasted 47000% daily value B12) with a Propel water.

Between the two I staved off the inevitable for years."
EmergenC packets...one before drinks and when u wake up to pee.  Its got more electrolytes than a gatoraid and vitamins too.  
if you have the worst hangover imaginable? ~180 pnds, 800mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, a hearty bowl of marijuana and a walk to the mcdonalds and the gas station down the street to get G2 gatorade and 1000 calorie breakfast. the walk back. 
"when i come home bombed i have my methods. They may not be dr approved but if i can drink a liter of Hennessy and rise like a phoenix there has to be some validity to this:
--------

i pan fry a steak in butter with onions. I love a ribeye but usually go for a sirloin. drink a glass of water as you prepare your steak. Upon time to eat, drink another glass of water with your meal. After eating, take 2 aspirin and 1-2 Benadryl depending on tolerance. If you're a weed smoker, roll up a joint/blunt/etc too. Being a drunk fucker kicks your REM cycle into immediate overdrive, often leaving you with 3-4 hours of sleep. The benadryl allows you to sleep through the night more soundly. (ALSO: try and piss twice in between this whole method. Pee as much as you can)


When you wake up, you should feel slightly groggy but overall well functioning. Immediately drink a glass of water to get your organs moving, and pop another aspirin if needed. Ramp it up on the weed the next day if you're truly struggling but the method should be succesful"
If you can get it, klonopin. I have it prescribed for a legitimate medical reason, but every now and then I have a terrible hangover and it knocks that stuff right out.
"Eat some active yeast (mix with yogurt), it will prevent you from getting too wasted.  

http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/a18609/how-not-to-get-drunk/?mag=pop&list=nl_pnl_news&src=nl&date=121815"
No joke - egg whites and fruit by the foot.  Fry it up in a little butter, spread it on toast, and hangover=gone.
Honestly, I've cured it by forcing myself to get up as early as I can, chugging a glass of water, and going back to sleep for a few hours. That seems to do it. It's kind of between a cure and prevention.
You'd think this is common sense, but taking a multi-vitamin in the early morning or in the middle of the night helps a ton. Drinking heavily all night deplenishes your body of nutrients, you have to replace them.
My university cafeteria has a stall where they do pork/chicken ramen with beansprouts cabbage and a spicy-as-fuck broth. The first sip pretty much cures my hangovers and leaves me ready for a day of lectures, its amazing.
Curse the day I was born, swear off wild turkey forever, experience crushing depression and sadness, then do the same thing all over again the next weekend.
"If you are so hung over you can't even keep water down, I recommend Dramamine, the extra drowsy kind.

Pop a couple of those and fall the fuck back to sleep.  Keep Gatorade or water nearby and take a couple of small sips whenever you wake up a little.  Having a friend wake you up every 45-60 mins for a couple of sips is even better.  4-6 hours later, you are a little more hydrated, less nauseous and have slept away the majority of your hangover. "
"I bake a greasy egg with lots of cheese and ham, eat it on a sandwich and drink a bottle of [Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(sports_drink)#United_States) with it. 
    
But what REALLY helps is working out. I'll feel like shit at first but when I step out of the gym (or whereever) the hangover is totally gone and I feel actually better than ever. "
"Prehydration before and during drinking (1 liter before you start and 16oz after every 3 drinks while drinking), rehydration in the morning (as much as you can get down), a b-complex vitamin, and about 600mg of gabapentin (neurontin) if you can get access to it. After you consume all of that, walk to the nearest place that serves a good (preferably greasy) breakfast meal and drink coffee/water. 

If you follow my recipe, you should be hangover symptom free by the time you finish your walk home. 

"
Coconut water sorts me out, but really no hangover cure has beat the effectiveness of just learning to pace myself. You don't have to choose between being a teetotaller or partying; just spread out the drinking. You'll maintain a steady buzz while actually remembering some of the fun shit you did, you'll maintain your energy, and feel better the next day. I rarely have hangovers these days if I just stick to a drink or two per hour with water in between. It's also had the nice side effect of helping me focus on finding more fun and interesting things to do while drinking, than just focusing on drinking as much as possible as the primary activity of the evening. 
"I'm 33 and for the entirety of my drinking life, my friends have always insisted on Bojangles breakfast bisquits the morning after shutting down a bar.
(I don't like bisquits tho, so I couldn't say from personal experience.)"
"I don't know how commonly known this is, but energy drinks seem to have been invented to help cure hangovers. I can go from ""barely able to move"" to ""ready to go"" after a Red Bull or a Monster."
"Here's my routine, and 100% of the time it works every time. It shares a lot of elements of others posted here, with one important addendum.

First, drink a tall glass of orange juice. While you're doing that, fry up some bacon. Then fry some eggs in the bacon grease. In the remaining grease, fry two slices of bread. Eat your breakfast sandwich with a cup of coffee. Then--and this is the important part--take a long, satisfying shit. You'll forget you ever drank.

I don't know why, but no matter what I do, I don't feel better until I've had a giant shit."
If you drink a ton of water before falling asleep, that'll usually prevent or at least lessen the hangover the next day. If you've already got the hangover though, I've found drinking Alka-Seltzer helps. So does weed if you've got it. I also try to eat something high in protein. Where I live, breakfast tacos are the go-to hangover cure; my fav is carne guisada with cheese. And get moving. Exercise if you're up for it; if not, just move around in general and drink lots of water. Help your body process that shit and get it out of your system.
"Hair of the dog is bullshit. 

Water, water, water. When you drink your fill in water, go and drink some more water. You think people would know that, but I have had to enlighten many on this. "
I normally get straight up drink a glass of water with a thiamine (vitamin b1) tablet and go for a swim, works like a treat. 
A few drops of milk thistle and emergen-C before you start drinking is a pretty good way to stop a hangover before it even starts. 
"Heres what I use

8oz coconut water
1 hard boiled egg
1 Banana 
1 Bagel (plane)
Lots of water

Works overtime for me"
Sprite. I go to the corner store, get half a cup of sprite and Powerade in huge cup. Burp then feel better. Sprite was tested by the Chinese to be the best cure
"I've got a pretty good system that nips it in the bud:

Immediately after waking up, chug at least 8oz of water.  Bonus points if you have the foresight to put a bottle of water by your bed [or the floor].  

Next, 2 multivitamins or a five-hour energy, 1-2 non-drowsy Dramamine pills, 2 chewable Pepto tabs.  Also I'd recommend a soft fruit, generally bananas or berries work well and they are easy on the stomach - your blood sugar is going to be very low, so you'll want to get that back up in a controlled manner.  I'd go with Bananas because of the Potassium.  Dose yourself with Ibuprofen if you've got a headache.     

Breakfast - should be eaten within an hour of waking up - ideally a Dunkin' Doughnut's Breakfast Sandwich and a small cup of coffee.  

After breakfast, 3-4 oz of pickle juice or a bloody mary, non-virgin if you're feeling really lousy.  If you can stomach it, go for the pickle juice as the preferable choice.  I happen to love pickles, so this is fine by me.  Pickled ginger or ginger tea will help settle your stomach if it's still a bit queasy.     

Throughout the day, plenty of fluids and some fruit.  Coconut water or Pedialyte are excellent choices.  You should graze on healthy snacks throughout the day and eat bigger meals when you feel up to it.  Don't overeat in one sitting - big spikes in your blood Glucose levels will make you feel worse.  For lunch, if you can get some good authentic ramen with some greens, there's nothing better.        

Really, the Dramamine is key here - combined with the Pepto, it should eliminate some or ALL of any subsequent nausea, and typically makes the spins (if you've got em) bearable or makes them vanish entirely.  

Finally, if you're 420 friendly, then you already know what else would tie a ribbon on this whole process.

"Haggis.

Last Friday I drank from 5pm-2am and didn't eat a damn thing during.  Dragged my ass to a faire in the morning and found some haggis to eat.  Turns out offals and raspberry lemonade is a great way to get back on your feet."
"Well, here's the SurelyDrunk Breakfast of Champagne-eons^^tm:

* 1 packet of Alka-Seltzer

* 1 large, greasy bacon-based sammich, with eggs if you got 'em

* 1 bottle of V8

* 1 bottle of orange juice

Preferably ingested in that order. I also recommend the hydration thing, but that's prevention, not cure. The bacon sammich has plenty carbs and a bit of protein to take the edge off, and the Alka-Seltzer calms the most urgent symptoms. The V8 is an awful tasting vitamin boost, and the orange juice is an apology for making you drink the V8, while dropping more vitamins and a ton of vitamin C into your system.

Make sure you drink plenty water the day after your terrible, terrible mistake, and you should be fine."
"I usually lay around and bitch all day to anyone who can hear it, 99.99% of the time ill be feeling better by the next morning.

**better**"
"Not the healthiest but this was my college cure. Wake up...
Smoke (weed)
Eat (fried greasy food)
Shit (that food)
Sleep (nap)
Wake up again
Shower


Back to normal"
If I know it's going to be a mad one, I put three big bottles of Lucozade in the freezer before I go out. The next day, when I'm anxious as hell and ready to pack it all in, I run a very hot bath but only halfway. The other half I fill with cold water. I then get in, making sure my body is submerged but my face is out, and drink all freezing cold bottles of lucozade. Works 80% of the time. 
"Powerade, Lucozade or any electrolyte based drink does absolute wonders for me. If I know I'm going to be getting totally trashed I will pre-purchase two or three bottles. Start drinking one when you get home and sip on it whenever you wake up feeling thirsty, then smash another one when you eventually get up. I've found that I don't get any hangover effect whatsoever.

Weirdly sometimes I can tell I'm still drunk but I dont have any of the groggy effects of a hangover. I feel I can functionally totally normally the next day as if nothing had happened the night before."
"Russian here.
Cold Brine from pickled cucumbers or tomatoes or patissons. 
Or 1/4 of guava juice, 1/4 lemon juice and 1/2 water or tonic(to your taste)

might be a little late but coconut water before bed hydrates the shit out of you and prevents hangovers very well.
Coconut water to rehydrate (more electrolytes by concentration than Gatorade, and has actually been used as IV solution when saline wasn't available), a Red Bull for B vitamins and caffeine, and a protein shake for some calories/easy to drink breakfast. 
"1. NAC - this one is key
2. Water - duh
3. Milk thistle -before, during, and after
4. Eating before you go to sleep (preferably a döner kebab)
5. Sleep - you will need more than usual since alcohol causes you to miss REM cycles 
6. Stick to non sugary drinks
7. Don't smoke cigarettes 
"
"Wake up the next morning and have 1 drink, take some motrin or tylenol and start drinking water. 

If a drink is out of the question, replace it with a heavy breakfast. Heavy as in eggs, bacon, etc... It doesn't sound appealing, but it clears me right up afterwards. "
And don't put your feet under the covers. Best when your room is coldish. Works like a charm! get's the blood pumping.
There's something about one of those 99 cent Arizona green teas. Those thinks always help me out when I have a particularly bad hangover.
"Why does everyone insist that drinking water cures hangovers? Dehydration is a *symptom* of hangovers, not the cause of it. All you did was hydrate yourself. If you honestly think water cures your hangovers, then either you have some physiological phenomenon going on, or you had 3 beers and are ""hungover"". Someone much smarter than me can elaborate on this, but hangovers are caused by toxic by-products created by your liver breaking down the alcohol compounds. Water doesn't negate that.

The closest thing to cure for a hangover (other than a saline IV) is a multivitamin, exercise and time."
No one is going to say weed? Or totally removes nausea and makes me headaches go away every them. Such a pick up.
While the best cure is prevention (food, sleep, WATER) in my experience, a big bowl of Pho really kills the hangover. Lots of salts+hydration+nutrients gets that job done
If we're talking serious hangover, Xanax and a nap. If you need to puke, take the Xanax after so it isn't wasted. 
"Pedialite.

Made to save children from diarrhea induced dehydration. Used by high-level athletes in weight-cutting sports such as boxing, MMA, wrestling."
"A medic in a unit I was in was stealing Saline from the aid station. He was running a ""Hangover Clinic"" out of the barracks (for a fee). Best hangover cure I know of that actually works."
At least 2 glasses of water before bed. You'll wake up perfectly fine regardless of how much you've been drinking. 
I drink at least a few cups of water throughout the night that I'm drinking and wake up feeling amazing
A bit late but a question: if you are hungover and go to the hospital and ask for a saline drip - do they give it to you (against payment of course)? 
"Not passing out right away when you stop drinking. The longer you stay up, the longer the body runs and does what it could to ""sober up."" When you go to sleep, the body doesn't work as hard to do so."
Cardio. Go on the treadmill or for a nice job and I promise you will feel 10x better afterwards. You definitely have to make sure you replenish afterwards but cardio instantly relieves my headache.
Green Tea. It has been by go to morning drink (with or without the morning hangover). It has caffeine to give you a boost and anti-oxidants to rid your body of whatever evil you consumed last night.
Sauerkraut. Discovered this when I was in high school working at a pizza place. I was making a Canadian bacon and sauerkraut pie and chomped down on a pinch of it. Started eating more and feeling much better. Must be the vinegar just like pickle juice. 
Consume a small amount of alcohol when you realize you have a hangover, your body is reacting to a chemical leaving the body, reintroducing a small amount of that same chemical lessens the effect.
I always drink a bottle of Powerade or another isotonic drink, replaces all the lost minerals apparently. And then I take some heart burn tablets. Eases my stomach. :)
"The first time you wake up: take 4 Advil with a glass of water (or as much water as you can handle), then try to sleep again

Then: order a dominos pizza immediately

Then: turn the shower on and lay down on the floor of the tub. Don't get up until the hot water runs out or the pizza shows up

Then: eat the whole pizza

Then: go back to bed."
Electrolyte pills... basically the same effects as gatorade or pedilyte but alot less liquid to drink (i tend to puke when i try to chug anything especially when hungover)
Some say it might be dangerous or not working but if you are moderately drunk then when you come home you can take one panadol or aspirin before you go to bed and your head won't hurt that much when you wake up.

"I have two cures.

1.   before binge drinking, buy two little ceasars pizzas.   eat one. eat the other slowly throughout the night.

2. pickle juice mixed with lemon juice.  "
On mornings where you're hungover but need to day drink (mardi gras for example) a mimosa will help cure your hangover and help get your drank on
Not really a cure, but I heard that eating dairy products BEFORE you begin drinking can greatly reduce your chances of any stomach upset or hangover problems, because the dairy will form a sort of protective coating in your stomach. My advice is to chow down on some pizza or mac-n-cheese before you start drinking, have a glass of water with every alcoholic beverage you consume, but above all, know your limits! You don't have to be the drunkest person at a party to have fun, and your body will thank you for taking care of it!
"Wouldn't know, never been hung over.
After I've had too much whiskey I cook myself a large flank steak, pan-fried in salted butter. I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks, and go to sleep."
Curing a hangover isn't black magic. Seriously, the cure to a hangover is not getting one. Drink gatorade BEFORE drinking. Drink water while drinking, before you go to bed, and immediately when you wake up. If that isn't enough to stop your hangover then you should check out your local Alcoholics Anonymous chapter because you have a problem.
"A hangover stems from the fact that in your body getting rid of alcohol a two step process for this example., first you break down the alcohol into acetaldehyde using a molecule of water, and then you have to break the acetaldehyde into acetic acid using another molecule of water. 

A hangover is a combination of a few things. 

If you drink hard, dont piss, and drink almost no water then you have a build up of acetaldehyde. This compound is the known cause of the shitty feeling associated with being hungover. You will be dehydrated as a consequence of your body using ~double the volume of liquor your drank last night to remove what it sees as a poison from your body. 

Hangover cures are always some variation on: hydrate so your body can metabolize acetaldehyde and get electrolytes into your body so you don't want up cramping and groggy. 

Also the symptoms caused by lots of acetaldehyde in the body can be lowered by taking NSAIDs. 

TLDR: Drink water, get some salty food in your body, take some aspirin, and then sleep. There is no magic cure, only variations on the same thing."
Insect patches you use for camping. Stick one on before drinking and leave it on till the next day. Drink without repercussions. You're welcome.
At the end of the night I drink a few glasses of water and eat a shitload of plain bread. I don't know the science behind it, but it works every time.
When I lived in Wisconsin, there was this chain of incredibly unhealthy greasy spoon diners called George Webb. I ate there all the time off of hangovers, and it worked wonders. I highly suggest eating some greasy food for breakfast.
Pure carrot juice. Or anything with an assload of vitamin A/beta carotene. Take non-drowsy dramamine, and advil. Nobody believes me, but seriously carrot juice and dramamine fix everything. 
IV fluids, a joint, Vicodin or Percocet, Sausage Egg & Cheese McMuffin, large iced coffee, and a really comfortable recliner.
When you first wake up, before the true terror sets in, drink water and take two aspirin. When you wake, make sure you look up at the sun. That has a way of forcing your clocks to set themselves. 
Anytime I drink alot and smoke weed the same night, I usually never have a hangover the next morning 
"As someone who drinks regularly and never gets a hangover I attribute it to my 32oz glass of water and emergen-c. I usually finish it when I get into my room before bed then I fill up with normal water to chug in the middle of the night.

is there a way to learn how to administer an IV to yourself? Don't want to be sticking needles in myself without proper training but don't want to go through nursing/medical training. 
4-6 ibuprofen and a full bottle of water before you go to sleep. You may have the hangover craps, but headache won't be there. And a full breakfast with bacon.
So...here's my cure. A zofran (have a running prescription), one cucumber melon Gatorade, and greasy food. Works 100% of time. Sometimes I throw black coffee in.
SHOWER BEER. As soon as you wake up. Crack that beer, get in the shower, wash your goddamn hair. If this doesn't help, go for SHOWER BEER #2. Yell at someone to bring you another beer, crack that beer, stay in the shower, turn on some music, drink the beer. It will work eventually. I've never had to go beyond SHOWER BEER #4.
Take a lot of vitamin B (complex) the night before along with plenty of water, and another first thing in the morning. It works wonders. I had a herbologist tell me to use Grapefruit Seed Extract pills along with the b vitamins. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't tried it. It works wonders. 
Charcoal pills before you go to bed, or even if the morning help.  You can buy them at any Walgreens or CVS and they're usually for gas, but they work wonders in clearing toxins out of your system.
Water with lots and lots of lemon wedges squeezed in. Showed this to someone and I think they fell in love with me for a second because if how well it worked. 
Tea works amazing for me chamomile before bed and green tea in the morning. I usually feel good enough to hit the gym 
The last time I had a bad hangover headache, I had a couple mouthfuls of olive brine (It was something my father used to tell me when I was growing up that I wanted to test. Still want to do it scientifically). To my surprise, it worked! Totally fucking disgusting and I felt like an animal (mentally at least) but it somehow shocked my brain into not being all hungover any longer.
A Russian friend of mine told me if you are going out for a night of drinking, eat a couple of well buttered pieces of bread first. The bread to absorb and the butter to line the stomach. 
This german herbal drink called Underberg. You drink one of those tiny bottles before going to bed and the next day you'll feel like you didn't drink at all.
"I can't believe no one has mentioned COCONUT WATER. Has the potassium and the hydration. Chug a bottle before bed after drinking too much and no problem in the AM. 

I have mixed rum with my coconut water before bed and it still worked. "
Vitamin B pill. I take one before I start, before I go to bed, and sometimes when I wake up. Makes yo' pee pee bright, too.
1 large cup of water, 1 cup of coffee, and 1 beer. If extra shitty add OJ, water, and/or one more beer. Works for me every time.
Powerade or gatorade, before sleeping and when you wake up. Hangovers are mostly dehydration and loss of electrolytes. Sports drinks solve that.
Don't smoke or mix drinks while you're out. Get something fatty with carbs to eat on your way home. Drink a pint of water before bed, take a paracetomol, and eat a BANANA. Wake up and have another few pints of water and a greasy breakfast. Top it all off with a Lucozade sport. 
I assume most people (as in the majority of people) don't smoke weed.  But ya, smoking weed.  Instantly pulls a 180 on all but the most horrendous hangovers.  Just make sure you drink a lot of water too, because it will dehydrate you which will worsen the problem in the long run.
"I'm a fitter/welder, when I was extremely hungover at work I'd just blast the oxy from an oxy acetylene torch in my face for a good 5 mins, made me feel a bit better.

 I don't believe there is a true cure for a hangover though, just wee tricks that ease the pain, I'm curious to know just how well the IV drip works."
I suffer from migraines and have a prescription for sumatriptan (Imitrex), and it also zaps my hangovers completely within about an hour. It is fucking incredible. 
Find an oxy-acetylene torch, take a big breath of just the oxygen side. It's nearly instant, just don't open the wrong valve.
"Eat a slice of lemon to get the ass-taste out of your mouth. Especially useful if you're one of those people who only smokes when they drink.

Added benefit of being quite a shock to the system and waking you up, as well as a decent vitamin c boost, you lush."
Ramen noodles has saved me several times.  I don't know why, but I've always felt much better after waking up with a hang over and then eating some ramen noodles.
It's simple, drink lots and lots of water. I usually forget while I'm chugging vodka but even the next day when you first wake up down like 2 or 3 large glasses and take a couple of headache medicine pills. A big cause of a hangover is your body is dehydrated.
I'll eat some pickles or olives and down some water before bed, or in the middle of the night if I wake up. I don't know why but I feel like this always helps me feel better
Seltzer water. It rehydrates you and helps with with your stomach. I always have some by my bed after a night of drinking. It works like magic after an hour.

HANDS DOWN, the best cure for a hangover is to take a regular dose of cold or headache medicine the night of, right before you go to bed. A Perfect 5/7.
"2x 500-750ml coconut water, banana, 2x 500ml sports / electrolyte drink, 750+ml water, teaspoon of salt added to small glass of water, ibuprofen.

Come home drunk, try and drink one bottle of coconut water and a pint of water. Wake up groggy, drink other coconut water, salt water, ibuprofen and another pint of water. Hour later eat banana and sip electrolyte drinks over the day. Red wine / cheap cider hangover lasts for about 2 hours next morning."
Pear juice! Drink like a litre of it before or during you start drinking, I haven't tried it too often but it always worked. 
If you can stomach it, live in the jurisdiction, and walk without falling over, a swim/struggle splash around in the ocean is terrific hangover cure
As a previous F/A-18 Engine Mechanic for the Marine Corps, we used LOX all the time. There is a shop that is designated to work only on he Environmental Control Systems which is what LOX falls under. LOX is short for liquid oxygen. It goes through this long process that I don't understand and turns into a form that is breathable for the pilots. Well, when we had a great night out and started the suffering of the great hangover, we would grab one of our buddies that worked with LOX and just take a couple breaths from that. Instant sober. Fucking lifesaver when you're about to go see your commanding officer. 
Running.  Now this is not for an ohmygodimgonnapuke type hangover, but if I am just a little hungover, a run helps me.  I get on the treadmill for about 10 minutes and feel a million times better.   
"First find someone else who is also hungover(preferably more so) and annoy the absolute shit out them..
Doesn't quite get rid of the hangover but certainly helps."
Taking a vitamin b pill and two aleve (not acetomenaphin based) will prevent a hangover every time. If I forget to do that before I go to bed, Monster rehab is designed to help hangovers 
Plenty of water (drink loads before you go to bed if you remember), carbs, fat and sugar plus some fruit/veg. I tend to go for ramen with some vegetables thrown in followed by a chocolate bar. I also keep a 2 litre bottle of water next to me and get it down as quickly as possible
Vitamins. Vitamin B12 before and after drinking. Multivitamins work as well. That, water every couple drinks, and some food as a base and you're solid. 
"Move over, ARTICHOKE is the real deal. Not juice because it tastes like shit (probably) but eat two of those, boiled, then soaked in lemon+salt.
Cure of gods. But water always helps too."
"- People have been drinking alcohol for hundreds of years
- Hangovers are largely caused by a metabolite of ethanol, acetaldehyde. It's toxic. Your liver breaks it down further into Acetate, which breaks down into carbon and water. This process takes time and is compounded by being dehydrated (if you are).
- This is a silly question - if there were actually effective ones they would be widely known, they are not, ergo they do not exist.
- PS for anyone about to call bullshit you have the confounding addition of your own physiology to take into account.

"Sex. 

I'm a huge fan of banging the morning after a bender. My girlfriend usually finds me disgusting then, but I can oftentimes wear down her will to resist. "
Thrive+. It's a pill you can buy online, completely safe and legal. Take 3 before bed and feel 80% better the next day. 
WATER. It really helps. A litre of cold water in between drinks and some before you go to sleep. Bam, you're cured. 
The cure: Breakfast Bagel BLT. Literally, the combination of greasy bacon and carbs in the bagel just soak up all the gross youre feeling. 
Ondansetron! It's a prescription drug but nothing crazy.. Is an anti-nausea pill and works an absolute treat in minutes!
"It will probably be too late for anyone to see, but Dramamine helps if you get a hangover that comes with nausea. It's motion sickness pills and it has been a miracle for me. 30 minutes after taking it I am able to keep food down and not feel like I'm going to vomit from scents alone.

Pedialyte for hydration and killing the headache."
That great feeling when you're still young enough to hit it hard until 5am. Grab a 3 hour sleep and then be up and good to go for work. 
"Preventative care is the way to go. Chug a glass of water and take 4 Advil (not Tylenol) and brush your teeth before going to bed. Works for me 9/10 times. 

If you were too drunk to remember the above, drink as much fluids as possible, take four Advil, long hot shower, take a shit, masturbate, nap, drink more fluids."
"If you can stomach it, a V8 and a tunafish sandwhich will work wonders.  Marijuana for the nausea.  Easier said than done on the tuna sandwich.

I'd be interested to see how well the peripheral IV cures the hangover.  Once.  I imagine it works wonderfully.  2L of D5 1/2 normal, some B vitamins, zofran or reglan for the nausea.  Might as well y-site a bag of vanco for the gash in my leg that I got from the fall as a result of my drunkenness.  Better hookup a bag of morphine too because my leg really hurts.  And you know what, why don't we just place a PICC line while I'm there and give me a pump and we'll get me some TPN so I don't have to eat, and I can go right back to drinking.  "
Most people don't know about what actually works to cure hangovers.  Fluids, fresh fruit (for the fiber), and light physical activity (the faster your blood supply filters through your liver the faster you'll recover)
[9 Supplements to Counteract The Negative Effects of Alcohol](http://www.nootropix.com/counteract-alcohol-negative-effects/) 
After you finish drinking alcohol, drink water and eat something a little salty or have sports drinks until bed time - don't go to bed drunk.
Here's something that works for me every time. I'm a skinny guy, around 125 lbs. Eat meat while drinking, chug a bottle of Gatorade before sleeping it off. When you wake up, a can or two of Bacchus (Korean energy drink).
When I was drinking, the most #1 thing that has ever helped me ever was pickles. Maybe it's because I really like pickles? I don't know honestly but salami, pickles, pepperoni, crackers, water. All super good drinking foods. As to what has always helped me with hangovers is chinese food sometimes. 
A great thing to do while hungover is to be active. Try exercise or go for a long walk. Mix this up with drinking a lot of water and your body will be healed.
don't mix your drinks. I know it can be hard to stick to but it is worth it. You still get pissed but without a hangover, only a temporary grogginess 
"I find that a triple fried egg chili chutney sandwich works best for me. 

It's like a cross between food and bowel surgery.

Personally I find it works, but you need to fry the 3 slices of bread as well as the eggs and use the spiciest chili sauce you can find."
Deep fried shrimp from and Chinese food restaurant. The fatty oils, absorbent batter and astaxanthinin (natural anti-inflammatory) in the shrimp works wonders!
"Anything that is for ""water replacement/hydration"" 


My pick is hydralyte rehydration - it's tasty and goes well before you go bed and when you wake up..... honestly THIS WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER"
"This is super going to get buried, but screw it.

The ultimate hangover cure I use when I spend the night with my man:


* good morning blowjob
* give him 1 naproxen and have him drink a bottle of water
* rub his back and play with his hair until he falls back asleep
* wake him up a second time with breakfast in bed (bacon is necessary - the scent is a natural alarm clock)
* shower / possibly shower sex depending on how he feels"
I don't know if people don't know this but it works for me all the time: just stay in bed and go back to sleep (if you have nothing else to do for the rest of the day).
I use white montmorillonite, never fails, gone in 30 minutes! Have fun and remember, AA is for quitters :) 
"This routine as served me well if you need to work the next day:

Before bed, drink 2 glasses of water, 300mg of aspirin, one dose of antacid.  Repeat this after breakfast and after lunch the next day.  Don't drink any alcohol until evening.

If you don't need to work or do anything, then just keep the fluids up and get bedrest."
What do you know about? Do you drink a couple of glasses of water after an evening of drinking alcohol? That works for me.
Drink some coke. I do not know how this works. Maybe it digests alcohol for you or something. Anyway. It works. Also when I have Gastroenteritis it is usually about the only thing my stomach can process. So if you feel nauseous, go for the coke!
masturbating and cumming in a shoe box makes for great relaxation and relief of a hangover. remember to leave it by the bed when resting.
Green tea. Antioxidants do wonders. Chug a bunch before bed, get up and take a real cloudy piss, feel like a million bucks. 
I know this sounds crazy, but an alcoholic drink. You don't need to go crazy but have a beer, then start with the water and normal things. Takes the edge off.
The best hangover cure is to be proactive while your drinking. Every few drinks have some water. Before you go to bed have more water. When you wake up have some water and get as much sleep as possible.
Going on a run in the morning helps get rid of a hangover very quickly. I don't remember exactly the reasoning but I think it has to do with getting rid of all the excess carbon dioxide or something. You will probably vomit though
Don't drink yourself stupid and you won't have a problem. Fuck, billions of years of evolution, and we lack basic common sense.

I used to have access to saline bags and IVs at work. My coworkers and I have definitely used them on ourselves after horrible hangovers...and apparently this is more common than I thought because several times nurses and students have mentioned it too. 
"If I lived somewhere touristy like Vegas, I would totally start this (am a nurse practitioner).  I heard about this company from my friends who live there.  They hydrate you with saline IV drip (or maybe a ""banana bag"" which is an IV with saline and vitamins in it), give you naproxen (anti-inflammatory), zofran for nausea, and I think even some oxygen if you want it.  "
I was too afraid to try this but I know people who did. While I was still drunk/hungover from drinking a bottle of vodka they were feeling 100% fine. I should have joined. 
God, I can't imagine the amount of money those businesses have to pay for insurance. Any sort of mobile medical service that caters to people who are possibly intoxicated just smells like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 
I was in Vegas like last month and in the MGM grand theres a place where you can get that. I think its called revive.
"There is a thing called a [Banana Bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_bag).  It's basically a yellow solution in an IV bag that people are given when they have a high dependency on alcohol (among other reasons).  

I once saw a guy who was completely incoherent, basically in and out of consciousness, BAC around .38%, given this solution through an IV and within about 10 minutes he was awake, alert, and functional.  It wasn't a cure, but it sure did work!"
I have a couple of friends who are paramedics who always have these on hand. It seems really odd, but you wake up feeling amazing.
I went to college with nursing students, and they would do IV drips the morning after a party. It apparently worked really good, and within an hour your hangover would be over. I don't like needles so I never opted to do it, but the people who did do it swore by it. 
"There is a place in Tampa called the hangIVer that offers this service. They offer different ""flavors"" of IV bags that you can choose from."
"exactly what the doctor ordered!  When I was a medic in the army, almost every weekend I'd have another soldier popping up at my barracks door so they could get an IV from me.

It was risky, performing an IV feed in the barracks was against the rules, so I charged 5 bucks for Normal Saline or 10 for Lactate Ringers.  Usually one bag was all it took, Normal Saline replaces the water volume you've lost while Lactate Ringers replaces the electrolytes you've lost.  I preferred the Lactate Ringers just because it got rid of all the symptoms.  The normal saline got rid of the headache but not the nausea."
When I was in the Marines, our Navy Corpsman would hog all the saline to cure himself of his hangovers.  Dick.
"This. Medics at the Army Base where I lived would come through the barracks on Saturday mornings with saline bags looking for volunteers. It gave them a good way to practice on hard-to-find veins.
"
"I'm a medic in the army, can't remember all the drunk iv's or hungover iv's i've given or taught people how to do.

Did this on my last day in Vegas. Soooo worth it. It's run by a doctor who studies at Cornell. Really cool dude. Even drove us back to our hotel. I just laid in a big comfy chair for an hour drinking Powerade. Life was beautiful. 
I have a friend who is an EMT who brought a bunch of saline drips over when he visited, and got us all hooked up after we went to the bars on a Friday night.  I have never felt so perfect in the morning after a night of drinking.
I live in New Orleans and know of a few places that offer stuff like this. It's pretty fantastic, although it can get rather expensive since insurance won't typically cover shit like that.
I was a Navy Hospital Corpsman and we used to hook each other up with post-bender IVs before work after a port call. 
this sounds like something you'd read in a not too distant sci fi story.  im glad to find out in this thread that the future is NOW!
There's a place in NYC that does it.  The comments section of the article on it was all wondering how they got away with using zofran, which is normally prescription, but the rest seemed on the up and up.
Company in Australia does it too. Costs you about 60 pounds to cure your hangover.... best cure I know is to just have another beer at 2 quid, Ill go for that, thank you.
"I don't know the name of the business, but I know what you're talking about. The local news stations have done reports on them before. Apparently they actually work really well.

There's a pretty simple product called NUUN that is probably cheaper than an IV drip haha. Its a hydration tablet you throw into water. If I know imma be fucked up, I usually make sure I have a glass of if available to drink that next morning. Usually crushes my hangover in less than an hour.

"Just make sure you actually get up to pee.

I also make sure to pre-hydrate by drinking lots of water before I even go out, if I know I have plans to drink, so that I'm starting at a surplus rather than a deficit. It helps.
Water before bed > Anything you consume in the morning. A friend taught me this and I've never looked back. Granted, you can still get a hang over, but it will be a fraction of the hangover you'll get without the water. 
"I always ask for a beer and a water at a bar. And they must both be gone before I get more.


I also pee a lot when I drink."
"I add magnesium to that last glass of water just before going to bed. They say you lose electrolytes along with all the water you lose when drinking so I like to refill it (in advance).I have never really had a bad hangover after doing it but I can't tell for sure if it's a causation or a coincidence."
I also recommended just acquiring a taste for straight liquor.  It's cheap beer and all the mixers that make you sick.  
"I've also noticed that on nights of heavy drinking you'll likely wake up early in the morning with a dry mouth. As much as you dread getting up, force yourself to and get a glass of water and go pee if you need to. It'll make a huge difference when you finally do get up versus laying in bed all night dehydrated. 

Your advice is the best though, staying hydrated while you drink can stave off a hangover completely. "
Along the same lines, if you're drinking mixed drinks or liquor on the rocks I've always made it a point to finish the ice in the glass before ordering my next one. Nothing too substantial, but it surprisingly helps cut back on issues the next morning.
Drinking some Gatorade or popping an electrolyte pill with that glass of water doesn't hurt either. But yea, water is really the best advice on this thread.
Can confirm this last night. I made sure to really hydrate because I get hungover easily. I drank 1 glass of water for every 2 drinks. Feel great today.
Every time i drink i usually chase a couple shots with a glass or two of water and wake up happy and not hung over at all!
"> you will have to get up and pee later

I've leaned that you don't have to **get up** to pee. Going to the bathroom will be necessary though"
Gatorade is even better for this. Every time I've drank a lot, I drink a full bottle of gatorade and a full bottle of water before going to bed. No hangover the next day.
"Usually when I reach my ""Alright that's enough."" Stage about an hour before I decide to sleep I just start drinking tons of water. Drink a lot of water and take an ibuprofen before going to sleep. Wake up perfectly fine "
I don't always drink alcohol to excess. But when I do, the water I drink is a tactical move to decrease acidity for when I eventually throw it all up to make space for drinking more alcohol.
Drinking water is the best advice and it goes hand in hand with not mixing drinks. If you started with wine stick with wine don't fucking hit the scotch!
Last time I got fucked up I drank 3 cups of water before going to bed. Never had to pee, didn't have a hangover. Being young is great. 
"It is absolutely true. Alchohol dehydrates you. My anatomy professor taught us that when you are dehydrated your brain sags and pulls on the membranes that connect it to the skull. This causes the headaches, nausea, etc so commonly found with hangovers. Drink water WHILE drinking and before going to bed. Voila, most of the symptoms are prevented. Read more here:

http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/drugs-alcohol/hangover2.htm"
Only one time while drunk have I remembered to drink water before bed. A friend handed me a 2L bottle and said drink this, so I did, and woke up in the morning with no hangover at all. And I'd drank a LOT. It is the miracle cure that nobody remembers to drink. I find it only works before bed though. If I try it while hungover I tend to just throw it back up.
Yep. This definitely has helped me plenty of times. Also, if you, for whatever reason, have one of *those* nights, or you don't drink as much water while drinking as you should, drink water before bed, and then whenever you get up to pee, drink some more water while you're up!
"Most of the reason this works is because you pee out all the beer.

Might as well drink less and call that a cure.

Water before bed is a good idea though."
"I live by the credo of Prehydrate, Dehydrate, Rehydrate.

Get a solid base layer of hydration in, drink, and then towards the end of the night start drinking water/gatorade while you are drinking, and then continue to hydrate before you go to sleep."
"In Sweden we have a saying, ""Varannan vatten"", which translates to ""Alternate with water"", i.e. you should alternate between alcohol and water (E.g. one beer, one glass of water, one akvavit, one glass of water, etc.).

It's because of that saying that we are able to drink copious amounts of alcohol the entire weekend and still work efficiently on Monday morning."
"If you're friends with a doctor ~~steal~~ acquire saline and some fresh cannulae!

It was interesting hanging around med students who were debating the merits of different brands..."
It's weird when I tell friends that and they look at me stupid, but then they wonder how I get shitfaced and wake up at 4-6am on the weekend to watch soccer and not feel like shit.
I had the longest piss freshman year because i did something similar. I still didnt want to get out of bed so i held everything in til 1 in the afternoon. I swear it was like something out of a cartoon.
This is really all you need. Yeah, an IV of saline and b vitamins and anti inflammatories would be better. but for those of us not in vegas, just drown your hangover. 
"I remember one time after a night out I realized I didnt drink much water. Grabbed a bottle and got in the shower. Just leaning on a wall thinking I need to drink this but I probably wont be able to drink this normally. Ao I uncap it, and just squeeze the water into my mouth. Good times.

Also eat some starchy food I think. I usually have a plate of nachos alongside drinking."
This is key. I like to drink red wine in the evening and try to include one big glass of water for every two glasses of wine. I just use my wine glass and the cold water from the fridge. When I don't remember to do this, it's always worse the next day. Even just one big glass of water makes a difference.
Doesn't work for me. I have at least one water per drink + 1. (Start with water, end with water, and water between drinks.) I also eat first and during, just moderate amounts. I still wake up dead.
I set alarms to wake up at hour intervals and chug water then fall back asleep before it makes me sick.
Yeah, this works, but sometimes when I do this, I'll get up in the middle of the night still blacked out, and piss somewhere I shouldn't. It's happened 4 times now. My friends are not pleased. I am not proud.
You can't just drink water. Of course your liver needs water to break it down but that's not all it uses. B vitamins and such also have to be in account 
"Here's my procedure:

Find a flavor of Gatorade that you like the taste of at room temperature. Leave a 32 oz bottle of it out somewhere that you'll see it when you come home. The point of having it be room temperature is that you can chug it a lot easier.

After chugging it, sit for 20-30 minutes (basically until you piss out the first wave of it). THEN go to bed.

When you fall asleep drunk, you're more passing out than properly falling asleep. By waiting up to piss out the first wave of it, you can fall asleep a little more sobered up and thus get better-quality sleep."
"yep! Alcohol dehydrates. Apparently you're a ""pussy"" for spacing your drinks out with water, though.

sorry I don't want a pounding headache all day tomorrow."
This is the correct answer. You feel shit when you're hungover because your body is dehydrated. Keep your fluid levels up and you'll still feel fine in the morning.
I drink at least half a gallon of water every time I drink (combined during and after), yet I still get the worst hangovers that last until I go to bed the next day. Even with ibuprofen. My body just doesn't work well lol.
My wind down routine from drinking is always three huge cups of water, and two excedrin extra strength. Hasn't failed me yet. 
"I do this all the time and I always hear ""drinking water just makes you throw up more"" every morning I wake up just fine and haven't thrown up. People need to learn how to listen and learn."
So true. Water while drinking and after and have Gatorade ready in the morning. I sincerely believe the hangover headaches are attributed to dehydration. 
This always work, also drink coconut water and eat 1 or 2 bananas in the morning does an amazing job.
That's my cure tall glass of water right before bed.  Maybe a couple preemptive advil just so I don't wake to a preheadache 
There has yet to be a time where I didn't do this and I always laugh when my friends complain about hangovers
 You forgot to add: when you wake up to pee drink a liter (4 cups of water or whatever you can stomach). This will make you wake up again to pee. Drink another 4 cups of water. 
I have this theory. People say that they never used to get hangovers when they where younger. I think this is because when you're younger and don't want your parents to catch you piss drunk you chug a bunch of water, hence reduced hangovers.
Even if you don't have water right along you can help things with the water at the end. I make myself chug water until it's uncomfortable. Then I wait a second and have some more. It make 1000% difference in how I feel in the morning.
When I first got a hangover I didn't drink much water at all.  Second time as well. Then I thought one day, since alcohol gets you dehydrated, what if I drink some water with it? Would it work? Tried it the next time I drank. No hangover. Just a slight headache. Seems like it worked. Now every time I drink a 12 Oz beer, I drink a pint of water. I also make sure that i drink electrolytes. No hangovers yet. And I get hydrated first before I go drinking. 
"I would say to chug more than just a glass of water before bed. Chug, chug like you've never chugged before. When you think, you have had enough, you stop right? NO, you chug some more. You're body telling you ""dude, I don't think I'm thirsty anymore, i think you are going waterboard-- i mean overboard"", you tell it to f off and that it is going to thank you in the morning so it better swallow all this water down its gullet."
Everyone should know this. You get hungover because your brain is dehydrated. Just drink some damn water while you're drinking, and you should be fine. 
"It mitigates it for me but it's more of a mild hangover than ""OH MY GOD I'M GOING TO DIE"" 3 days of constant pain a normal hangover is for me."
I remember being 18 and being able to go to the bar and just pound back beer after shot after beer after glass of wine and wake up the next day feeling right as rain. Now I have a couple ounces of hard alcohol and it feels like the hulk took a giant shit down my tbroaht. The only way I'm able to drink and feel okay the next day is coors light or vodka waters 
If you employ the strategy 1 glass of water for every drink you have, you should be ahead of your free water defecit. 
"This right here. I had many college benders in my earlier days and this has saved me from ever having a hangover.

I would add to take an Advil with the water at bedtime."
Interesting. Personally, I've never ever had headache after drinking, but while drunken, I wake up multiple times in the night to drank a *lot* of water. That's probably the reason for it.
I've never gotten any type of hangover. I usually drink water to alcohol at a 1:1 ratio. But breaking the seal occurs too soon.
I have been doing this for years and I can agree the peeing thing at 6am is not cool but waking up a 10am feeling like a champ is the best! 
This is why pickle back shots exists. A pickle back shot is a shot of Jameson with a pickle juice chaser 
I drank a jar of pickle juice once. Maybe a jar and a half. I had the worst diarrhea ever... There were waterfalls coming out of my ass. It was crazy. I can't imagine that not happening when drinking that much pickle juice. 
I'm not polish but in eastern europe this is common knowledge. Works like a charm every time. Trust us, we drink like fishes in that area...
Don't have the link to sources but some studies say it may be better than water to help with rehydration, which is essentially what a hangover is.

When hangover this taste heavenly. "
In Sebastopol you can get kimchi juice shots at the farmer's market and they're a real kick in the pants. It'll clear up a hangover, even if you didn't have one.
If I recall correctly, Polish pickles are naturally fermented, not vinegar-infused. The natural yeast on the pickle and the salt water make all sorts of magic microbes that make them sour, and then all the spices make it taste all polish. I used to work on a polish farm and the owner (my friend's granddad's uncle) made barrels of them that they swore were the best cure for pretty much anything but especially hangovers and hot days' work - AKA: dehydration. 
"I do this sometimes, it either works or makes you feel twice as worse.

It's a huge gamble.

Although the pickle juice, roll mops, beetroot and hard rye bread seems counter intuitive it can sort you out."
Confirming this. Just be sure you're not punch-drunk, gag-factor is formidable. Also, **don't** do this without bread.
just make sure it is polish style pickles, many of US types are way too vinegary, but yeah, it is notorious russian cure as well
I heard the same thing about coconut water. It's full of that good stuff that apparently cures hangovers. Can't stand it myself but apparently it works in the same way.
"Gatorade (specifically G2) is actually recommended by a lot of physicians for hydration if Pedialyte is not available.

In addition to electrolyte supplement, another reason these drinks work well is because one of the receptors that helps move water across the cell membrane in your body is facilitated by sodium ions and glucose (sugar) molecules. That's why Pedialyte and Gatorade are good at replenishing - they have both."
Anecdotal, but my wife and I keep Pedialyte stocked up in the house for hangovers. It takes an hour or two, but it has definitely helped us recover from some nasty hangovers in the past.
Yeah, you can get electrolyte tablets too. The nuun ones come in a ton of flavours and they come in tubes of 12. Just chuck one in some water and you're sorted. 
My doctor recommended we buy Gatorade and water it down instead of Pedialyte.  She said the resultant drink was the same, barring taste, but Gatorade is cheaper.
in a similar vein, I have an athletic buddy who swears on those energy gel things that marathon runners and long distance bikers use.
"+1 Pedialyte.  It's real.

For years I'd been a 3 drinks, then a water guy.  If I kept that ratio, I'd usually do OK.  Not so much any longer.  So, I kept doing that, plus added a 16oz Pedialyte before bed.  Then also chug a bit when I get up 4-5x time piss.  Magic.
"
POWERade or Gatorade works just as well. Check the amount of stuff innit. Source: parent for sick kids.
"That will only rehydrate you which is good but you also need to regain the vitamins your liver used up to break down the alcohol. Take some vitamin b supplements as well as drink that shit. 

To anyone who doesn't know pedialyte tastes like water with a small amount of milk in it for the after taste. "
"Generally accurate, one other thing I would add is that the other component of a hangover is thought to be buildup of an alcohol breakdown product called acetaldehyde. This is thought to be a generally nasty feeling compound. It's also thought to be what's responsible for ""asian glow"" which is actually acetaldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (deficiency of the enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde). Fun fact - if you type ""asian glow"" in Wikipedia it redirects you to acetaldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (at least it used to, I haven't tried it for a few years). "
Any kind of professional athlete the weighs in and had to dehydrate them selves will always us pedialyte to re-hydrate, it's common knowledge in those sports
"Yeah, I feel like people who give ""drink a lot of water while you drink"" advice have just never been out drinking properly. I mean, once you start drinking, you drink to get drunk and water is just gonna ruin all that. Why even drink in the first place then? For the taste?

But I come from Finland, a country full of alcoholics, probably one myself. So my words on the matter should not be taken as advice."
I heard they are going to start marketing it as a hangover cure as well as a childrens drink.  We shall see.
"Just finished my paediatrics rotation, can confirm.

There's also a [WHO homemade rehydration recipe](http://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm) that has saved tons of friends and an ex when hungover in several parties."
I did a six day bender in Mexico and spent about $100 on pedialyte while there. I downed that shit all the time. I survived. Can confirm this worked. 
Just drink propel. It's by the makers of Gatorade and is basically the same thing but just flavored water with electrolytes
Jason Isbell said that pedialyte was the thing that kept him playing shows during his alcoholic days. 
Well and alcohol essentially converts into a poison as it metabolizes. I can drink all the water in the world and I still feel terrible the next day. Used to be able to hit it hard. Now I have 3-4 beers and I feel it the next day. Getting old sucks
"Just did a quick ebay search for Pedialyte but all the listings are shipping from America.  Anyone know what the Australian equivalent of this is?

edit: [I'm guessing one or any of these products.](http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/Shop-Online/191/Electrolyte-Replacements)  anyone able to recommend one based on experience/knowledge so I can look into bulk buying"
Hydralyte for my Australian brethren. And it comes in an icypole if you're having trouble keeping things down. 
Been doing this for years (since my son was little).  If you're not down with the Pedialyte taste, I suggest the frozen popsicle version. Keep a box in your freezer and whenever you need some electrolytes and fluids, they are there for you. :) 
"Years and years ago Maxim magazine touted Pedialyte as ""Strippers #1 recommended hangover cure"". I've been using it every since. "
"I think juice is a good hangover drink. Alcohol is a poison your body tries to flush out, when drinking alcohol your body removes it along with water and other vitamins/minerals. Juice gives back these. The day after pills are mostly just vitamins and minerals anyway.  
   
If I'm wrong, kindly correct me on this."
Nothing like week long benders. Drink just enough between the day to stave off withdrawal. Good times...
"Ramen is a runner-up.

If your partying involves crashing in a hotel room (raves, conventions) and you feel too crappy to go out, break the ramen brick into a few chunks and put it in the coffee maker (sans coffee of course). "
I usually take Gravol and Advil as soon as I wake up feeling crappy, sleep for a couple more hours and I'm golden. 
"Ah, reminds me of a little jingle my friends and I used to sing after a heavy night of drinking:

♪ ♫ The best part of waking up, is cocaine in your nose! ♪ ♫"
Just because you mentioned puking, funnily enough throwing up before hitting the hen made my mornings like heaven. I discovered it on accident, but now every time I get belligerent enough to puke (I'm in college don't judge) I'm not scared of it, cause it's alcohol I won't have to process. Plus, it gives you that extra belly space for some more drinking ;)
I feel like this might work for someone who is so nauseous they can't keep fluids down (i.e. me, when I'm hungover). Will try.
This sounds cool, but I have heard that eating snow will dehydrate you. You use more water in the energy changing the snow to water than you gain from the water. 
I heard somewhere one time that snow does not hydrate you because it takes more water to produce the heat needed to bring it to body temperature than the snow can offer. This has something to do with the snow being about 1/3 dirt.
Are there any other good sources of Cysteine that don't involve cooking? I tend to be pretty lazy when I'm super hungover, and usually eggs wouldn't appeal
"my favorite hangover/powermeal is oatmeal. but not like you think...

* few drops of sesame oil
* bout a shotsworth of olive oil
* tamari
* two slightly undercooked fried eggs(break the yolks and let the hot oats cook the rest)
* avocado 
* kimchi
* toasted sesame, pumpkin, and sunflower seeds

usually turns to a bit of a soup at the end, but just wow is it powerful. hangover or not."
wouldn't the aldehyde already been broken down by the time you wake up? I don't think it's the alcohol (molecule) directly that makes you hungover. 
Yup my hangover cure is water between drinks, some sort of salty food during the act of drinking, a large glass of water, then in the morning, if im still hurting, i'll crawl over to the stove and boil some eggs for 8 minutes (for a medium type egg) then some salt and pepper for flavour, scarf em down, then go back to bed. works like a charm.
Now hold on, alcohol leaves the body in accordance of zero order kinetics; meaning a certain amount is metabolized every hour. The graph is linear, where as most drugs leave the body in a 1st order fashion. Explain how this egg scenario works.... With science

Yes, when you're hungover Callipos are *the shit.* Refreshing, full of sugar, and cold enough that you have to take a bit of time eating them so you aren't sick.

Prenatal vitamins tend to work better, and it's fun to keep them around to freak out your parents when they snoop around your cabinets
I have seriously been nauseated all fucking day and that's pretty much what I'm thinking at this point. 
"Came here to say this!! I discovered this after the worst fucking hangover of my entire life where I vowed I'd never been hungover like it again and I found this gem! 

Honestly folks this one's a major winner, and my liver takes a battering regularly cause I'm a student aha"
">If it actually worked because of the water, hangovers wouldn't exist when you drink lite beer. Most alcoholic drinks are more than half water.

You're neglecting the fact that alcohol is a diuretic."
"RIP your liver. 
Seriously, please don't do this. At least take something less liver toxic like naproxen sodium. "
"I had to search for this. Benadryl is similar to Benzos that are similar to alcohol, so for some people it relieves the short term withdrawal symptoms. 

Valerian Root is also a good but little known cure. *""The drug is also used to lessen the anxiety, agitation and tremors that occur during alcohol withdrawal.""*

Boom, 2 little known hangover cures that replace the ""hair of the dog"". I'd only recommend one or the other paired with Pedialyte. 

Also, 5 Hour energy shots. B vitamins help so goddamn much."
I'm mid-30s and if I'm hungover I will hop on my treadmill and try to get 4-5 miles in.  Sometimes  I just need to sweat it out (and I keep water with me of course while jogging) and then take a nice long, shower.  That usually cures it for me.
Oh man. This is the reason I want to live in a building with a pool. When i went to Oktoberfest in Munich, I woke up the 2nd day at 4:30 or 5 am to get ready. I was in a small hotel room with 8 other people that needed to shower. I walked down to the pool, swam for about 5 or ten minutes, jumped in the hot tub, and used the pool showers. Made standing in a line for 3 hours waiting for the tents to open easier than it was for my friends.
Something about the ocean is very healing and calming. Usually no matter how shit I feel, If I hop in the ocean for a few minutes, I feel way better.
I'd love to do that but swimming in the sea in my town this time of year is pretty much like taking a bath with the Kracken.
"I actually do feel less hungover if I get up and move around the next day.

I think this is how I survived my colleges homecoming weekend."
Yup. Running is my Saturday morning cure in the summertime. The first mile or two is completely punishment but sitting with a glass of ice water afterward is just what the doctor ordered. 
I think if you're mildly hungover, then a gym sess, feels good, like helps sweat out the toxins. However if I'm brutally hungover, it just does more damage than good, my heart rate goes to like 190, feel like I'm gonna have a fucking heat attack
"Ahh I have to disagree w this one. 

Was mildly hungover one time and was almost 100% again. Thought, ""hey! I'll go for a run! That'll wipe out the last little bit if hangover.""

Wrong. Started sweating, got further dehydrated, started feeling worse. Threw up on the side of the road, spent the rest of the day on the couch begging for death. 

2/10. Would not recommend. "
If I woke up hungover and groggy with a bucket of water next to my bed, I'm not sure I'd want to drink it.
"> Wake up, drink water, smoke a j, sleep for another bit, more water, more weed, food, water 

So basically get stoned and sleep it off all day? I feel like if you just spent the whole day and *time* was actually the cure"
I like your style. This is exactly what I do, drink water before you go to bed until you literally cannot drink anymore water.
"There have been many occasions where i wake up hungover and drink a ton of water then i end up puking. 

I have switched to slowly drinking water the next morning instead. Of course drinking water throughout the night is best but drunk people don't make the best decisions., "
I do agree that overloading on water before bed works, but be warned: on Thanksgiving this year I did that and pissed in my bed...
I added a 5 hour energy to my Gatorade /Alka seltzer drink. The B vitamins and caffiene were helpful. Sometimes a swig of Pepto Bismol if I had nausea symptoms. Good as new after a shower and some food.
Holy shit I thought I was the only person who knew about Goody's.  My uncle got them and I thought he just bought some random fuckin medicine from Ocean State Job Lot or something.
Beer has water in it I think.  So basically if I drink a beer between my beers I should be fine then right?
Disappointed to have to scroll so far to find this. Benzos completely annihilates the hangover. Stuff like Ambien (Zolpidem) and Imovane (Zopiclone) also works. Weed will just make it worse for me.
"This will work for the every now and then drinking fiesta, but if you're on a two week long country music festival bender, you're probably looking at some serious alcohol withdrawal that Mary Jane can't handle on it's own.

How early before your start drinking do you do this? I've had yogurt before and then proceeded to take a shot. I could literally feel the yogurt curdling in my stomach, and it did not feel good. 
Bakers yeast ferments sugars to alcohol, it doesn't affect alcohol itself. And I doubt yeast will ferment in the low pH-environment of the stomach. Yoghurt, though, might help settle your stomach as a probiotic.

It's in an episode of Scrubs. JD and Turk give themselves saline through an IV in a closet at work I think, after a long night out. That's where I first heard about it. I'd imagine it's a pretty common thing to do in healthcare.

The last time I was there we saw a billboard for a similar company who drove a tour bus up and down the strip that's set up like one of those portable blood banks you call the number they come pick you up and a while later your back on your feet.. my uncle tried it and now swears by it 
Last I heard it does exist in Vegas, but it's like a traveling bus. You get on it, ride around for a little bit getting fixed up then they drop you back off. 
back when i was an EMT, our CCT Nurse would hang a saline bag for us if we needed it. works nicely. always wanted to try a banana bag.
They're starting [this](http://www.ivmeaustralia.com.au/what-is-iv-therapy/how-it-works/) in my city, Sydney. Cheapest treatment is $149. You'd have to be pretty fucking hungover to fork out that much cash. Maybe Vegas will have some rich executives who might have an important meeting the next day, that would pay for this quick fix
After laying in bed with a hangover yesterday, I spent some time thinking about this too.. Obviously banana bag is the way to go if you have access.. But if not, I was trying to think about ideal IV fluid.. Would it be LR?  D5LR?  Or just D5 1/2NS without the multivitamin as a pseudo banana bag?
"This is one of those things that Reddit thinks is a good idea. And probably most freshmen business school kids

Yeah, they travel around, charge a couple hundred bucks, and get you out of there in 30 minutes feeling 100 times better. 
"I had an ex who was an alcoholic, he was admitted to hospital with stomach bleeding, they gave him two of the banana bags, one for four hours, 4 hours of saline and another one for four hours, then they asked me to take him home to get a drink because clearly this wasn't even making a dent on the withdrawal symptoms.

If you wake up hungover (nauseous but not feeling the need to vomit) have a few shots, drink water with your liquor, eat when the nausea goes away then when you sober up youll feel fine but tired so just take a nap. I never used to get hangovers but now that i do i just get a little drunk and do the shit i should have done the night before and take a nap. Works best on a weekend when you dont have shit to do. I dont recommend getting drunk before work.

If you're not too nauseous to keep food down, eat some Greek yogurt. Easier to eat than a lot of the ""conventional wisdom"" foods like greasy fried eggs/bacon/etc. because it's so mildly flavored and smoothly textured. But the protein kick really helps recover from both nausea and headaches."

A lot of people should drink more water in general. I'm convinced that a good portion of the population walks around mildly dehydrated all the time. 
"I was joking with a coworker about this the other day. In my college days, ""pregaming"" meant ""drinking at home to establish a buzz before going to the bar."" Now that I'm in my 30's, it means ""Eating a good-sized meal and drinking plenty of water before going out so I don't get a hangover."""
"Also make sure to drink something with electrolytes, as too much straight water will leach electrolytes from your body and make you feel worse. You can get small bottles of unflavored electrolyte supplements (basically a type of saline solution) cheaply at bike shops or sporting-goods stores; put a few drops in each glass of water when pre-hydrating and afterward, and it'll reduce the hangover even more.

Fun fact, most general hangover symptoms are due to dehydration, some with which I've had experience when riding a bike long distances in the summer. Learning to keep hydrated and electrolytically balanced when riding has helped me do the same when drinking."
I know this. The problem is actually remembering to drink water. I might remember the first glass or two but once I'm drunk the last thing I'm thinking about is water.
"I'm surprised how few people do this.  It may falter a little later in the evening, so I also make sure to go out pre-hydrated.  The other week I was doing this and the bartender commented on how many waters I was drinking.  I look around the bar and not one other person had water.  They may rely on the hair of the dog but I prefer to be productive on  some days.  

I do have to start to pee a ton after this and definitely wake up in the night once or twice but well worth it.  "
Make sure you premix that drink before drinking. Your drunk self may decide that [sodium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bAhCHedVB4) or [potassium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy1DC6Euqj4) would work *way* better for electrolytes.
"I dont think i could physically drink that much water. Im somewhere near 12-14 shots in this evening. A little drunk but still kicking some ass on CoD. Ill probably have another 8-10 shots before i go to bed. If i remember right a ""glass of water"" is 8oz. A bottle of water is roughly 16oz. I would need to drink 12 bottles of water between now and the time i go to bed (within the next 4-5 hours). Ill just do as i usually do. Ill drink a little water with my whiskey, drink a bottle of water before bed, and drinm water any time i get up to pee. 90% chance ill wake up fresh as a daisy (10% chance ill stay up late and drink more)."

I work for a fishing charter company and I went into work one day following a night of heavy drinking. Never had a hangover so bad that I wanted to throw up the next day until then. The feeling of wanting to vomit just wouldn't go away. A customer I had helped a week before brought me a couple jars of pickles from his farm to show his appreciation for something I did for him. One jar was labeled spicy, the other was not. I decided to sip on the spicy juice to try to make myself puke so I could hopefully feel a little better. As soon as I started swallowing it, I felt like the weight of the world was being lifted off my shoulders. In 10 minutes my hangover was gone.
A whiskey pickle. Better than it sounds. If you're not a big whiskey drinker the vinegar really cuts out the bite. 
A pickle back is a what the chaser is called. Coke back, soda back, water back, it all depends on the liquor

I have a freezer full of Pedialyte freeze pops. So good when you feel too hungover to even drink anything.
Maybe he's also an underground Olympic athlete. Ever think to ask him about that instead of assuming?
Coconut water and pedialyte are two essentials for post-raving recovery because you tend to sweat way too much and dehydrate quickly.
It is amazing for hangovers. It's definitely an acquired taste, but at this point, I always have a bottle in my fridge.
I did this as well. Would get a 16oz can of coconut water and whenever I was done drinking for the night would chug it before bed. Delicious and usually helped a lot with hangovers. 
It works best when drunk straight from a chilled green coconut, coupled with sweating some of the toxins out on the hot walk to the coconut stand, followed by a refreshing dip in the sea. I wish I could have all my hangovers in SE Asia. 
I heard *pear juice* is good. I've been trying it recently, I think it kinda of works, might just be a placebo though
Fun fact: latest (european) guidelines recommend to put avulsed tooth in coconut water for best reimplantation chances. It's that good for you.
But the osmolarity of pedialyte is better than coconut water. So I skip the coconut water and go straight to the pedialyte.
I used to buy coconut water but I felt that the high sugar content could make it worse on occasion. Idk

***COCONUT WATER: It's got what hangovers CRAVE!***"
"I have stomach issues, and after a day and a half of vomiting non stop i decided to go to the doctor. She told me not to drink water, but gatorade or pedialyte wouldn't hurt. But then she paused and got very serious and said, ""as long as its NOT the g2 kind of gatorade, that stuff is like poison."" I didn't ask anything because i was barely alive but she meant business."
You don't need Gatorade to get salt and sugar. Just add salt and sugar to water. Gatorade is useful in sports because it's isotonic. It doesn't replenish as much as keep you pissing and sweating out your salts.
I know that russians will *always* eat pickles while drinking vodka, and they're basically professionals so there has to be something to it
Huh. I used to have a Ukrainian coworker who insisted this worked but I thought he was trying to make me puke at work.
I'm somewhat of a pickle connoisseur, if I do say so myself. I would venture claussen has the best juice for this task. 
I think the freezer pops are better than the actual drink. When you're feeling barfy, drinking a lot of liquid always seems to make things worse.
"It has to do with alcohol suppressing the hormone that regulates hydration, which is called vasopressin IIRC. This is why alcohol makes you pee like crazy. The concept of ""breaking the seal"" too early is in fact a myth; peeing early on does not have an effect on the total amount you will pee throughout the night. You will just pee a lot if you drink, and consequently become dehydrated. This is why drinking a big glass of water for every alcoholic drink you consume will help prevent a hangover."
"It's definitely one of the causes as pointed out by another comment. Your body uses all available water to flush the alcohol out of your system. Other factors include electrolyte loss, conginers(toxins), and short term alcohol withdrawal. 

Pedialyte will rehydrate and restore electrolytes. Your body will need time to process conginers and those depend on the amount and what you drank(vodka has the least, dark liquor has more since they add to the flavor). Short term alcohol withdrawal can be waited out or you can do the ""hair of the dog"" cure and give yourself a dose of alcohol to stop the withdrawal symptoms. Benzos also work to eliminate withdrawals."
Tons of athletes drink pedialyte. Nearly everyone I know who cuts weight for combat sports drinks a bottle after weigh-ins.
"Unless you're drinking straight liquor, the ""that's sugar"" boat has pretty much sailed if you've been drinking all night."

"I think the sugar in the juice is just gonna give your liver another job to do, after it *already* had or has a job. 

Warm water with a squeeze of lemon is a better way to go."
Once I drank like 5 cups of orange juice in one sitting. Then I waited for 17 seconds and ran to the bathroom and puked it all back out. That was good juice too.
If you never stop drinking, you never get hungover, and when you die (likely of liver disease or alcohol poisoning), that means you win!

 interesting. Cocaine is not very suitable for ingestion because it breaks down in the stomach, so the primary uptake mechanism really is dissolution  on wet mucous membranes followed by diffusion into the veins.  The liquids you drink normally spend only a short time on your mucous membranes before they reach your stomach, meaning permanently fixating it on your nasal membranes is far more efficient. But perhaps because whiskey is a sipping drink, it would actually kind of work. 
Instantly better, or instantly worse.  You walk a certain line when you play hardball with a hangover.
Yes! I've often made myself blow chunks before bed because I knew it would be less alcohol for my body to process. Eases the future hangover quite a bit.
"Dude, don't hit the hen.

But seriously, I'll wake up on a saturday morning and be like ""How the fuck do I not feel like the living dead right now?"" and then I'll realize I threw up and be like ""Oh hell yeah!""."
"I usually do this too, but the night before, I was in bed with this girl. Throwing up was not an option. 

I am also in college, not judgement."
This Halloween I got extremely drunk. There's a solid hour of my life that I don't remember, which included falling down a flight of stairs. I spent half my night vomiting (and crying and bleeding) but was completely fine in the morning. Throwing up is a blessing sometimes.
"> throwing up before hitting the hen made my mornings like heaven.

I thought I was in a drinking thread until suddenly Chicken Sex!"
it's inadvisable to puke on purpose. it ruins your teeth, your oesophageal mucosa and I have seen this leading to people trying to force half-conscious drunks to puke, which is absolutely dangerous (aspiration).
i used to do this as well about four years ago when i was 18. stop doing it. that's pretty much the same as bulimia in that you will damage your esophagus over time. just be careful brah  
In this case, you either go out for breakfast or you make a more able-bodied friend go pick it up for you.  If your similarly hungover friend picks up breakfast for you, you are now friends for life.
I've never seen a more drunk human being than the time(s) I ran in to David Wells stumbling his way around Ocean Beach in San Diego. That man could party.
I get this but part of the cure for a hang over, at least from my experience, is forcing yourself make and eat breakfast. It sucks but it helps. 
You can make scrambled eggs in the microwave. They're not as good as making them on the stove but it's nice if you're in a hurry! 1 egg with a dash of milk, scramble, heat for 1 minute. I've done 2 and 3 on a minute and a half and it works out better than just doing one.
"Microwave. Whisk a couple of eggs in a measuring cup, add a little milk, whisk again, nuke for a minute or so.

You can also make bread in the microwave and have yourself an eggy little sandwich."
That's the worst. A huge greasy egg and bacon breakfast usually helps a ton. I hate when I wake up too hungover too make breakfast. So I either have to go buy food somewhere or just snack on little shit until I get the energy to make something.
Go to the nearest Vitamin Shoppe and buy a bottle of NAC (N-acetyl Cysteine) and take a few capsules.  You'll get way more cysteine alot faster.
"N-acetyl Cysteine tablets combined with b vitamins _before_ you drink. At least 200mg. More of a protective effect. Might help alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes keep up with the alcohols/aldehydes that build up... Nobody really knows. 

Can get them at health food shops. Smell pretty crap when you open the bottle. Gases with Sulphur in probably..."
Sounds pretty damned tasty.  I do a savory oatmeal as my regular morning breakfast (chicken, tamari, sriracha, chicken stock instead of water, and cracked black pepper).  I'll have to give your version a try.  Thanks!
"When you wake up feeling like a truck hit you, your body is soaked with the acetaldehyde.  Many people mistakenly think that its just dehydration, but its not.  Alot of the inflammation of the brain and other parts of the body is because of the acetaldehyde.  Its something like 10x more toxic than the ethanol.  

The guy with the NAC comment is correct and I can totally confirm it works.  "
Wow. I never thought of it. When I feel like I have drunk too much I eat sunflower seeds (for the salt)  drink water and take a multivitamin. Seems to work well for me. I never even thought about the cysteine also.

Ah, yes, how marvellous. Here we see the rare British redditor. Some say there are only hundreds of thousands of these creatures left. A tragedy, it must be said. 
50% of the time is about right, the other 50% it'll make me feel like crap for the rest of the day. Only do this if you are able to rest/sleep off your hangover all day. If you have to get up and do shit it's a baaaaad idea. 
Yup its a win win. Makes you hungry, so you eat / drink water which also furthers your cause of curing the hangover.  
For me it's about 50/50 whether the weed makes my headache better or worse, but it helps enough with the other symptoms that it's worth it regardless. Even an intensified headache becomes easier to cure when I have fewer other problems to deal with.
Not sure if you're being serious, but he means smoking weed, typically from a glass or ceramic smoking device
I don't get the joke, but morphine is the last thing you'd want for a bad hangover. Instant vomiting everywhere.
I think it has to be when you're kind of on the mend and just need that last little push to get to 100%.
"Are there any doctors here that can give some info on this? If you take it an hour before you need to get up chances are the alcohol is almost completely out of your system, and I thought advil was only supposed to be dangerous to the liver if you took them all the time?

Chances are this guy isn't trying to prevent hangovers 7 days a week. Is this actually dangerous?"
Dimenhydrinate also works for vomiting, it's found in the original Dramamine formula. Although it's been so long since I've needed these remedies I can't say which was the most effective.
Benadryl is a first generation antihistamine, only similar to benzodiazepines in their both having sedative effects in most people.
If you want to go swimming while hungover its not a real adult hangover. Thats just a college hangover. 
well my theory is that exercise speeds up your metabolism and gets your blood circulating, so your kidneys and liver do their thing and clean all the crap out of you faster. if you sit on your arse all day (like i have done today, also hungover), you'll just end up stewing in last night.
When I have a hangover, I'm liable to throw up from walking from my bedroom to the kitchen. I feel like running would get....messy. 
Yeah a nice 5-7km run is certain to banish the worst hangover. The first 10 or 15 minutes is usually brutal but you stop feeling the hangover once those endorphins start kicking in. I'll go running outside and I feel that just getting a lot of fresh air helps you feel better too.
it calms down the parasympathetic feedback loops and that usually calms the nerves. if you have the room spinning a cold shower will do the same thing.

Well, make sure you eat before taking that ibuoprofen, don't fuck around with NSAIDs, stomach ulcers are no joke.
It actually does not as much as what you are probably thinking of (acetaminophen). Taken in normal doses with excess water will reduce pressure/inflammation. Damage due to aspirin toxicity is a separate issue from the fatty or fibrotic liver changes from excess alcohol or obesity, for example. Plus, being I only get drunk about once a month I think I'll be ok. 
It doesn't make you more hungover, it gets you drunk for an extra hour or two, during which you can pump your body full of fluids and anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as some weed and a benzo if you're lucky.  This isn't rocket appliances bro.
It most definitely is.  Made friends with a corpsman...best decision of my life.  Nothing like waking up to an IV and a beer to start your day
Airforce Medic here: I can confirm this. When I worked in ER in Florida people came in for hangover issues. Gave them an IV and sent them on their way.
Can confirm, roommate in the navy was a corpsman. That dude saved me from miserable days at work many times.
Mad respect for nurses. Especially f they have the energy to still go out and party after working those insane shifts!! And it's not that uncommon. Hell, I think there are hangover spas on Vegas that will give you a saline IV. 
Depends on how bad the hangover is. I struggle with nausea with my hangovers. It would have me feeling pretty balanced almost instantly but sometimes I might struggle with nausea through the morning still, but by nearly as bad. It's a very chill (temp wise) and refreshing feeling once that saline gets pumping.

When my gf is gone sometimes I wont eat for 3-4 days and drink 2 bottles of vodka a day. Not because I can't cook I am just too lazy. By the time she gets back I am usually in pretty bad shape.
A common misconception about alcohol is that it goes through the digestive system. Alcohol is absorbed through the lining of your stomach and small intestines. That said, eating before you drink will slow that absorption as well as give you something to throw up. Not really sure about eating while hungover, but it makes sense to me
Sometimes I wake up with no nausea but then get hit with it hours later, like 12-14 hours after the last drink.  Anyone know what's up with that?
The old BRAT diet isn't so bad with something like Taco Bell in there someplace. Bowl of Chef-Boyardee spaghetti or ravioli and a Coke used to be a favorite. 
Eating multiple meals, drinking a lot of water? Where's the room for alcohol there though. I feel like you just don't get hangover because you don't have time to drink enough in the midst of all that water and eating.
The worst part was he got up, showered and slept the rest of the night on the couch; I was passed out (drunk as well) and he left me to marinate in it until I woke up that morning.
"I learned this from running track and cross country all through high school in the South. When it came time for practice in the middle of the afternoon and it was 90 degrees and 100% humidity, the chances of you passing out or not being able to run more than a mile were very high if you hadn't been consistently pounding water all day. Even if you had been you will still experience dehydration symptoms from running in those conditions for an hour or more.

I don't run in these conditions anymore, but to this day I feel uneasy if I do not have a way to continuously drink water all day. Being completely hydrated seriously does wonders for your cognitive and kinesthetic abilities. People who don't drink enough water are missing out."
I drink 32 ounces of water every few hours from a Nalgene at work and have to pee like every hour and my pee is clear is water. When I used to not drink as much water, it was a darker yellow which says you aren't hydrated enough (I think). That's what I use to see if I'm drinking enough.
Ive taken to trying to drink at least 64 fl oz of water while im at work. I have to piss a lot more but my body sure feels better. Plus i dont piss gold after a night of drinking.
Gatorade's a little too sweet—instead, get a bottle of cheap electrolyte supplement (basically a type of saline solution) from a bike shop or sporting goods stores and add a few drops to each glass of water. You probably won't taste it, but it will do wonders to help rehydrate and replenish lost electrolytes.
My local bar/lounge's waitresses all know me and my preference for a pitcher of water to start, as well as whatever I'm drinking that night.
Actually that's right. I don't have them laying around in their pure form right now but I might have some [Cesium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4pQz3TC0Jo) left so I'll try this next time I drink.
Actually, one of my favorite drinks is just Crown Royal with water. I get it, it sounds gross but everyone I've ever gave it to was surprised how great it actually tastes. Tastes good, not too expensive, keeps you hydrated, and is about as low cal as you can go for getting drunk.
"A bar near me is in an unincorporated area. They charge for water because they have bottled water. The have bottled water because their water source is well water, which in this place you absolutely do NOT want to drink.

If they didn't sell the water, people would just take a bunch as they were out the door."
Against the law in Canada, too. I remember it being in the Smart Serve course, you cannot charge for water, especially if someone has been drinking. In fact, you're pretty much told that you have to start substituting alcoholic beverages for water after a certain point.

Only if your problem is too little acid. The vinegar is what your body needs. If you have too much acid, alkaline is what you're after. A teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in a glass of water works wonders.
Isn't it just vinegar? Anything with that gives me heartburn. Holy shit though, I just googled pickle juice and most of the links told me I should be drinking it.
It's pretty delicious but most people find it disgusting. In my family is normal to drink it but some friends flip out when they see me do it. 
That's how my Russians taught me to shoot vodka. Pickles, potatoes and a bottle of vodka. What a night.

After drinking, your stomach lining is super sensitive. Consuming/drinking anything quickly can irritate it, causing you to throw up. Pops are def a good idea since you're eating it slowly and your stomach can acclimate a little. 
This is bullshit.  I drank like a fish for a few years, and I'm not saying that alcohol doesn't cause dehydration, but I cut weight for wrestling for nearly a decade and I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that the worst of a hangover isn't the dehydration.  Dehydration is miserable, but alcohol's effects on the nervous system can't be explained by a lack of fluids.  There's more to it than that.

If you cant handle menudo or eat around the tripe, just move to pozole instead.  Very similar but with better meat.

There were a couple of times in college where, after parties, I had to convince my boyfriend (now husband) to start trying *to* puke rather than trying *not* to puke, because I knew he'd have to puke eventually and he might as well get it all out now so we could go to bed. I think it did also help with the hangover the next day, too. 
Alcohol is really the only drug where you can discuss intentionally vomiting after binging in order to avoid feeling poisoned the next day, and people just take it as good advice. Out of context that sounds pretty fucked up.
The only bad thing is that if you didn't finish your bottle you can't drink it again without thinking about puking from it
I've tried this several times. Always better to get it out than to feel nauseous all morning. It's a 50/50 for me. Sometimes it works, sometimes I'll just feel like death and puke whatever I eat or drink all day.
It's definitely not religious... For example I only puked twice this semester. I'm just saying, if I get the feeling I never fight it cause I know some good can come out of it. But hell nah, I eat way too much shitty ass delicious food that I wanna keep in there, my beer baby needs a twin :)

Yep. This is why I quit smoking to cure my hangovers. I either felt great or felt even worse. Sometimes it would even make me feel drunk again.
Try drinking more water if the weed makes your headache worse. I smoke ridiculous amounts of weed and find that I usually only get a really bad headache if I need to drink more water and after drinking a glass or two it normally goes away. 
"He or she is thinking of Tylenol. And basically the risk there is that the liver is so preoccupied with handling alcohol that the Tylenol adds insult to injury.

My biology profs always said the best cure for a hangover is exercise. But I get what you mean, to have the energy required to go swimming while hungover is definitely a younger person thing.
I think so, too.  The exercising circulates fresh oxygen to your organs, which speeds up the metabolism of the alcohol byproducts.  I'm semi-hungover today and slept in too late to work out.  So here I sit at my desk doing nothing productive.  lol.  The only cure to this is my holiday party this afternoon where I will probably start drinking wine.
True.  My hangovers got way less nausea-inducing when I stopped drinking hard liquor.  In my early 20s, I thought nothing of drinking Jack and Cokes all night.  That all stopped when I started dry-heaving from it in the morning.  Now I stick with beer or a couple glasses of wine and the most I get is a headache and feeling tired/foggy all day.

"I have, but my first thought after waking up next to a bucket would be ""fuck, did I vomit in that last night?"""

In college I'd had two or three especially terrible hangovers which lasted into the next night. I'd spend the entire day in bed with a pounding headache and pulse of 130 trying to keep down water yet I would keep throwing it up hourly.

The conversation was so weird though, the doctor took me out and was like ""he shouldn't be released yet as he is still critical, but he will suffer more from withdrawal than he will from the stomach condition, so you need to get him home and give him whatever he normally drinks and then contact an alcohol addiction service urgently""

Really? From my experience they usually treat alcoholism with benzos like valium or xanax to prevent the serious side effects like the shaking or seizures. 
It does slow down a lot, though - I got gastritis from going to bed straight after eating quite a hot curry, and the doctor told me I was an idiot for not knowing that's a bad thing to do.
Of course alcohol goes through the digestive system. The mouth,  esophagus, stomach, and intestines are all part of the digestive system. 
"This was gross enough as is, but your use of the word ""marinate"" just brought the imagery and smell to another level"
I'm exactly the same way. I pound water before and after exercising and right after using the bathroom. And especially before I drink (alcohol) because I know I'm going to neglect hydrating once I'm buzzed. I'm also obsessive about the clearness of my pee and being near a water source at all times. 
I've started drinking a lot more water at work and found that I can focus better. Water is a simple magic that people need to drink more of
Best mistake I ever made was getting dehydrated. On a mission trip in Nicaragua where it's like 90 degrees with 100% humidity. We're working in the sun 8 hours digging water lines. I don't drink as much as I should (about 3 gallons a day). I started getting a headache and realized I'm not doing so well. But by then it was too late even though I started drinking more I started getting delirious and fatigued. I threw up later that day and about 8 more times that night. I hardly slept and was in bed for two days straight eating almost nothing but crackers. 
AFAIK it's acetaminophen/paracetamol that is bad for your liver, which is why it's not recommended as a hangover medicine because your liver is already stressed by the alcohol. Ibuprofen can be bad for your digestive system but is not nearly as dangerous. I'm too busy to find sources at the moment so somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.
I think the point of using Ibuprofen is that it is not deadly when mixed with alcohol, unlike Acetaminophen?

I think It is because the extra acidity can jolt your body into fixing the ph levels in your stomach. I drink pickle juice every day. Great for when drinking but I wouldn't exactly say a cure. Drinking water WHILE drinking is much more effective. Though pickle backs kick ass. 
Taste like liquid almonds to me; a really nutty flavor to it. It definitely isnt sweet like soda or Gatorade. 
As someone who pukes bile, drinking water before a puke is amazing and saves my throat and mouth from being digested by the enzimes.
"I had a raging hangover after my work Christmas party but I knew I had to get up and make it to the office the next day. I chugged a bottle of water from the fridge, got in the shower, and threw it all up. 

It was still cold. "
"[Congeners wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congener_(alcohol)) is more concise than I can put it. In short, they're toxins that make you feel like shit.

Things like good vodka have the least conginers because they're distilled to over 90% alcohol and the better ""cuts"" of a distillation run are taken and watered back down to drinking proof(protip, if a vodka is charcoal filtered it's probably not very good.) 

Whiskey uses cuts distilled between 40%-80% alcohol. Some congeners impart  flavor on the spirit but they contribute to hangovers. 

Any alcoholic beverage will have some amount of congeners. Also, alcohol itself will make you feel like shit, it's just the price of heavy drinking.

Short term withdrawal. It's exactly what it sounds like. Alcohol is physically addictive and 1 heavy use can lead to a withdrawal. This is the anxiety that you mentioned. The standard ""remedy"" is to have another drink. Valerian Root will calm those anxious withdrawal symptoms. It's an herbal sedative and handy for when you need to go to work and can't drink a beer or smoke a bowl. Benzos also work but are prescription drugs. Benadryl seems to work for some people, it'll at least make you less nauseous and help you go back to sleep."
"I've had DTing patients before. Holy shit can they be rough. 

What's probably worse though is when they have Wernicke's encephalopathy. I know it's possible to get it without excessive drinking but I've only ever had ones where it was from chronic etoh abuse. Basically you can drink yourself retarded (irreversible brain damage as a result of I believe B12 deficiency). "
Can confirm. My withdrawals included a lot of seizures. Seizures made my spine crush. Went to rehab immediately. It was fucking awful. Could have easily died.

Rereading it and realizing I just misread it, doesn't actually answer my question. What's a hash oil?
It gives you the cotton mouth to make you drink water, and makes you hungry enough you have to shove something greasy down your throat.
Well what's a night of drinking without coming home with food, smoking all your weed, then letting your food you've been craving get cold.
If I consciously know I'm gonna do it which is most times, ill try to chug a full glass of water just before, just to get it flowing ;)

"ibuprofen is also linked to stomach bleeding, ulcers, liver and renal failure; especially when combined with alcohol.  
It is actually possible to suffer an overdose from ibuprofen if your liver is weakened or decreased in function by heavy drinking, hepatitis, ect.

"Well, they're ""safer"" in that they don't have the habit forming risks like benzos. Hydroxyzine is what I use for nausea, vomiting, insomnia, anxiety as needed. It's basically just a stronger version of diphenhydramine (benadryl). Some people feel wired/panicked or just drugged from them though. Also they dehydrate you so drink plenty of water if you're also recovering from alcohol."
My friend would go for a run after a night of drinking. She was/is a bit of an alcohol addict and may have an eating disorder. She swore by running and bodyweight squats to cure hangovers.
Yeah, but by your late 20s you should realize that drinking games are dumb. I just drink at my own pace now. 
I feel your pain bro, I'm still currently working in retail and I deal with id10ts all day. One would assume a grown adult would behave rationally but I have been proven wrong so many times over
"Oh God, used to work retail. It was the worst for hangovers. I can go into my office today hung over, not too much of a problem. It's only bad if there's a meeting. 
"
I could totally see this being in my morning routine. Sitting at the table with my toast, peanut butter and apple, and a nice IV in my arm. Swearing at the news. 
You are, but I can attest to this. If I can muster the will power, I love hangover runs. They feel terrible but really help get the blood flowing. Granted, it's a light run, nothing too crazy.
Yes you're correct, benzos (mainly Ativan/Valium) are first line to manage agitation and seizures. Sometimes a barbiturate (phenobarbital) or propofol is added for refractory delirium tremens. However there's always been a six-pack of beer or bottle of Everclear locked up with the CII's in the hospital pharmacies I've been to, covered by a layer of dust. I'm always told it's for alcohol withdrawal patients but to be honest haven't actually seen it dispensed.
Hospitals kinda have this policy of not intentionally killing people, which is something alcohol withdrawal can do.

Can I raid the party host's pantry? My roommate only buys healthy food for our apartment, and I don't like kale when I'm drunk.
I cant eat much when im drunk. If i eat more than a little snack, im going to end up asleep on the couch within an hour. Alcohol plus food is a fast way to put my ass to sleep. Luckily im still just young enough to run on nothing but alcohol for a night without wanting to die in the morning.

As a former career black out drunk I can testify that pissing the bed (or in my case, just the corner of your room/the hamper) while hammered produces only that completely clear, odorless piss.  It isn't that big a deal to be soaked in it (obviously not the best)

"It's awesome. For lunch and dinner (just brunch on weekends), Uber has a menu of 5 things all from different restaurants, and they stock up their cars with everything when they start. Then, you just place an order on the app and they drive it over to you from wherever they are. It usually takes like 5-10 minutes.

It's usually $10 for lunch stuff and $11-13 for dinner, depending on the item and the restaurant it's from. They usually have cool discounts on the dinner items from the nicer restaurants in town. I'm a big fan, especially on a lazy, hungover weekend morning. They always have good breakfast sandwiches/omelettes/burritos. "
No, I rarely get hangovers as it is, but I usually have 2-3 cocktails (Manhattans lately) on a weekend night out before switching to 2-3 beers.
Apparently, even if you aren't an alcoholic, part of the shittiness of a hangover is your body going through withdrawal from alcohol, so a morning drink makes it feel better. Of course, that sounds like the recipe for actual alcoholism, so its not necessarily the best idea. 
No, they should get benzodiazepines instead of alcohol and not provided their vice while in the hospital.

Also - 3 years later and there is still an outline on the bare mattress of where the pee was (it's not as gross as you might think, it was aired out and cleaned but I refuse to buy a new mattress when this one is fine, especially considering I have a mattress pad and sheets over it)."
"I don't know whether or not to be ashamed that I can confirm this. Aw hell, here goes:

Can confirm, am blackout pisser."
"One time one of my friends in high school pissed himself and it somehow ended all on one of our other friends who was passed out on the floor next to him. The guy who took the brunt of the piss isn't known for being particularly bright. When we woke up his reaction was that he believed he must've ""sweat out all the alcohol"" because he was wet. Another time we all got baby drunk together, I woke up to see the guy who got pissed on standing up with his eyes closed with his dick just laying on a stool that was in the room. As soon as he started peeing I yelled at him and he just stopped and went back to sleep. This all happened in the same room. It was a fucking gross room unsurprisingly. "
"As a former roommate to a career black out drunk- fuck you, there is no way you're going to convince me that disgusting puddle under the fridge is somehow not that big of a deal. I hate you.

Edit- and if you try and blame it on my dog again I will train her to attack you, groin first, next time you have one of your ""accidents""."
Damn you sound like me. I used to be a career blackout drunk as well and if I had been drinking and pissing outside in the bushes all night, I would most likely end up pissing on the floor in the house or in the closet or some other stupid shit. I guess my brain would be on autopilot and thought I was still outside. 
"I'm going to have to disagree with your comment regarding odourless. 

I uh, have a friend who told me. "
Haha, I had a customer call in asking if we were still delivering (we've recently had a snowstorm) and when I said yes proceeded to say he'll order online then.
I don't have a gallbladder, so when I don't eat enough before drinking, I will keep vomiting every 15 minutes for about 4 hours the morning after. It's not from getting too drunk, but from my liver producing bile for my non-existing gall bladder. So rather than puke a couple of times, I will puke about 10-12 times. Not fun being naked on the bathroom floor hugging the toilet :-(.
It is. Please go, and I wish you well. My brother finally got it right on his about 10th try, and way too much damage to him. It's now 5 years later and he's been sober since. 
"Uh...i can't tell how serious you're being...do you genuinely believe a fucking *hospital* is stocking alcohol for the explicit means of ""giving an alcoholic their vice""?! Yeah, benzos definitely help with the symptoms of withdrawal, but going cold turkey off alcohol can be fatal. They wouldn't provide somebody with alcohol to placate them. It's so they don't fucking die.

Especially in the ED, they get their fair share of drunks and drug addicts, and are stingy as all hell with dispensing any sort of narcotic. The *only* reason they would keep alcohol on hand would be for medical purposes. So people don't, you know, *die.*

"I apologize if you think I'm being an asshole, but I think it would behoove you to educate yourself on the pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal. 

Alcohol is a depressant and as a compensatory mechanism the brain decreases inhibitory tone and increases excitatory tone.  When someone stops drinking, there is excess excitation. This is what causes symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The body doesn't need alcohol, it needs less excitation or more inhibition. Since it takes time for the body to decrease the excitatory tone, this is we give benzos to treat alcohol withdrawal. 

I am being serious. A hospital that is using alcohol to treat alcoholics are of the mindset that ""that patient is just going to go out and keep drinking so why not just give him a few beers to get him through whatever other care he needs here."" I absolutely disagree with using alcohol for treating alcohol withdrawal because I believe it causes the patient harm to not use a proven efficacious and safe drug over one with variable pharmacokinetics and narrow therapeutic window (i.e., alcohol). I'm not going to be part of continuing an addiction if there is an alternative, which in this case I do and is much better. We give smokers nicotine patches while in the hospital, you don't question that do you? "

"HowStuffWorks did a podcast on how hangovers work and the things your body needs when hungover are protein, potassium, and electrolytes.

The best combination of that I've found is my three P's: pedialyte, potato soup, and a protein shake.

To further add, chugging a bunch of water when you first get up on an empty stomach will just further nauseate you. If you don't have access to any pedialyte, try sipping on something carbonated like ginger ale to reduce nausea.

"A shower, fully clothed in the fetal position (not cold because I'm not a hard bastard),
left-over pizza from the night before (if you don't have any, then call around to all your neighbors and beg. It can't be a fresh pizza, you feel dirty so you must eat dirty),
Lots of pain-killers (borderline overdose),
When you wake up in hospital after someone discovers you frothing at the mouth and hypothermic from your wet clothes, hopefully enough time would have passed so you don't feel hungover.
Good luck and God speed."
"Pedialyte or similar products.  In Canada it's usually $10 for 500ml.  If you have the foresight to stock them ahead of time you can buy the freezer pops.  I like the icy cold feeling on the tongue, it seems to help a bit too.

It will usually be in the pharmacy aisle with other baby products.  It is used to hydrate infants that are having trouble retaining water.  It's quite effective for quickly rehydrating in situations like marathons, after cutting water weight to make a weight class, or after drinking."
Force yourself to get up and do something physical, even if you have barf a few times. You'll feel better once you're moving. Also, eat something hearty, like a fried breakfast.
All sorts of vitamins, 800mg ibuprofen, and a bottle or two of Pedialyte before going to bed.. Havent had a hangover in years.. 
I make myself drink as much water as possible before I go to bed and take an advil. Then in the morning I take a hot shower, drink some coffee, and keep drinking water.
"Hangovers are caused by the toxic metabolites of ethyl alcohol, acetaldehyde. This toxin is a free radical which oxidizes in the brain, causing pain.
The best solution to combat this is to take antioxidants to prevent oxidation and curing the hangover.

I like to take an antioxidant supplement which can be found at walmart. Some common antioxidants include vitamin a, c, and e. These vitamins can be found in most fruit. Also melatonin is a powerful antioxidant, which is why sleeping helps you feel better as your body produces melatonin before sleep; and finally, THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, is a very powerful antioxidant. This is why many people smoke weed to cure a hangover.
I also like to take amino acids which are found in protein. Although I don't know why, consuming protein seems to help, I recommend eating eggs and a protein shake."
The trick is to chug a glass of water, take two advil, smoke some marijuana, and try to sleep another hour.  By the time you wake up, you'll be chillin
Coke the soda not the drug. Drink some before drinking and after. I think the caffeine and water in it help. My fiancé does excedrin before bed but that made me throw up.
"I seem to have a problem the morning/afternoon after with vomiting. I don't know why, but I throw up for hours the following day. I've finally found that if I take activated charcoal pills before drinking, while drinking, and before bed, I will not feel sick the next day. With of course drinking water before bed too. I THINK the reason is because activated charcoal works to take out toxins from the body. When people drink too much and have to get their stomach pumped, they pump it with activated charcoal. So to me, trying activated charcoal seemed like a good idea. So far, it's worked wonders. It's cheap and you can buy them at any drugstore for cheap. You can find them in the gas and bloating section. 
This is for while drinking, not to cure an actual hangover, unfortunately."
Not sure if its all mental or in some way physical, but watermelon always makes me feel much better.  Hydration + some vitamins I guess.  Plus out of the fridge its nice and cold, which always helps me when Im feeling crappy.
Pedialyte. Or better yet BaNa. Rehydration salts work great too. And ibuprofen with caffeine. Do not take acetaminophen it's bad on the liver after drinking. Also foods high in glucose and potassium
Smoke some weed. Drink a beer. Eat something greasy. Go back to sleep. Chug water. You'll feel better eventually.

"After 15 years of exhaustive research employing different types of food, hydration techniques, exercise and herbal supplementation, I'm finally ready to roll over and accept the scientific community's viewpoint of ""Don't drink so much."" 

Seriously. ""Binge drinking"" (I hate that term, by the way. What's the point of drinking if you're not gonna have at least five) ends up giving you flu like symptoms because your gut is leaking all sorts of bacterial endotoxins into the rest of your system and your entire body is getting an autoimmune response. It's truly disgusting. You are literally poisoning yourself. If you absolutely must tie one on, you just gotta grin and bear the consequences. "
"Percocet.  Not only will the hangover go away, you'll feel pretty fucking awesome.

EDIT: okay, given the mixed concerned responses, I'm being partially serious, partially facetious.  Yes, as with any narcotic analgesic, you will feel some measure of euphoria (depending on the amount taken).  

If suddenly you find yourself wanting to cure *more* than just an incidental hangover, like maybe that feeling is so fantastic, it is *all* you wish to feel, you are likely a drug addict, and should look at one of the alternative hangover cures instead.

Yes, someone pointed out that after a night of hard drinking, probably not the wisest choice to load up the liver that's already taken a beating with Tylenol.  

Recent regulations as of last year, however, have mandated that narcotic formulations that contain Tylenol (acetaminophen, paracetamol etc) cannot have more than 325 mgs per pill precisely because of its effects on the liver.

1 even 2 at this dosage won't be an issue, even if your liver is essentially pickled from the night before."
Chug water. Sometimes it makes me puke and I feel better after. If I don't puke at least I'm getting hydrated and then I either take the hottest bath I can handle or eat ramen. I've heard that cucumber is good for a hangover? But when I tried I just puked it up

Easy way to prevent one is to drink a pint of water, and take a couple of painkillers. Failing that, I go into a shower and steadily make the water colder for like 30 minutes it works a charm, then go back to sleep cause I'm usually still tired as fuck. Also only eat half your takeaway and just leave the rest of it out in the open and eat that in the morning cold, a meaty pizza is the best for this.
"2 mg klonopin, diet Gatorade/Powerade over extra ice, instant ramen with extra broth. Wrap self in blankets and watch cartoons or something silly on Netflix to allay the anxiety I get from a hangover until the pills kick in, then I usually doze off for a bit if I'm lucky.


If I'm somewhere without my pills, or I can't afford to sleep in, things change a bit. Drink as much room temperature or slightly cold water as I can, hop in the shower if possible. Then a glass of coke zero or any diet soda pop with extra ice and I try my hardest not to sit down. If I keep walking and pacing or just standing it helps me get alert and get my brain moving, try to distract myself enough till I can fake it till I make it. 

I'm not someone who vomits in the morning after drinking, it would be much easier if I could. "

I stopped drinking so much, after going on the biggest bender of my life consuming enough alcohol that would kill most people I realized how stupid it is to get trashed because you can't function the next day, have some drinks just dont go overboard. 
Buy Gatorade at the same time you buy your alcohol. Drink a Gatorade after every two drinks (depending on your tolerance), and remember to eat before you start drinking. The best defense is a good offense!
"I stopped drinking overly sugary/fruity drinks. If I drink liquor it's usually bourbon or vodka soda. This has significantly cut down on the severity of my hangovers. I also stopped eating drunk.

Seriously, take a big swig of it after you quit drinking and before you go to sleep and it'll help immensely.  The salt and the acid help to counteract the effects of dehydration in a way water can't.  And if you can't keep it down at least you'll puke up a bunch of alcohol.
At least a pint of water and a fry up. Preferably though before sleeping  drink a couple pints of water, really minimises the effects.
"You haven't gotten any decent answers as far as I can tell. 

My go to - a big bottle of Gatorade, a bottle of V8, and some kind of savory breakfast - bacon egg and cheese works well, but ramen is also surprisingly effective. 

Something about electrolytes and sodium helping you retain water...  Or something. Dammit, I'm drinker, not a doctor. "
Gatorade and whatever greasy food I can get, with a preference towards a greasy diner breakfast. Gimme a plate full of hashbrowns and some biscuits and gravy.
Mine has worked for me just about every time. I wake up, and once I can stomach food I eat something with high sodium content. Instant ramen works well. After that I get really thirsty and I drink like half a gallon of water. Within an hour or two I'm just about back to normal. 
Water and advil before bed, sleep for as long as possible, water and advil as soon as i wake up, hot shower, greasy breakfast, blue powerade, Perrier water, immersive videogame. 
"Hangovers are mostly caused by dehydration, liquid is the answer. My cure uses five fluids to fight fierce fallouts from firewater. It's called The Quintet. 

A Water, a coffee, a beer, a ginger ale, and a bloody Mary. Water hydrates, coffee increases alertness, beer thins the blood and reduces aches and pains, ginger ale increases blood sugar and eases upset stomach, and the bloody Mary is pretty much liquid breakfast to get your day started. 

By the time you're done with all five, you're ready to start putting the pieces of your life back together. "
Drink two glasses of water before you sleep. Drink another 2 glasses when you wake up, coffee, and a BLT. If you're still feeling it, then pedialyte. 
Here is the the cure all hangover remedy that I will give to the world. Take some headache medicine any kind will usually work. The chug a red bull preferably a 16oz can of it. Then just drink some water 15-20mins and you'll be fine.
Surprised I haven't seen smoking pot in here. I usually try to drink a lot of water, maybe a coffee, then smoke a bowl and headache is all gone. 
Glass of water next to your bed before you fall asleep. You will wake up at some point, chug it, and fall back asleep. When you get out of bed: Sprite. Something greasy and salty like a burger and fries. Take a crap. Take an Advil. (Have had hundreds of hangovers).
No joke, freezer pops. The ones that slice your mouth open with the plastic. 5-10 of those, greasy sausage biscuit, and tons of water.
Drink some O.R.S before I go to sleep. It's actual tot prevent dehydration so it makes sense why it works.
Pedialyte. Most hangovers will be gone within 30 minutes of drinking half a bottle. Even my worst hangovers were taken care of by a full bottle.
I take a vitamin, drink lots of water and eat something greasy. That usually gets me functional in an hour or two
"Pint of water before bed. In the morning I have a ""mini-eng"" half pint of water with a Disprin and orange tablet in. Sweet tea/coffee. Muffin with egg and bacon.


Disprin settles stomach and head, Vit C, sugar and protien to give some energy, bread to soak up, bacon fat to break down remaining alcohol in your stomach."
Take a bath to rehydrate;  the epidermis is the body's largest organ, and will most quickly rehydrate you.
Drink water while you're drinking alcohol. Drink water after drinking alcohol. Keep water by the bed to drink during the night (or whichever part of the day you're half-dead through). Drink water immediately after waking up and regularly several hours after that. Don't eat sugary foods while hungover, they use up your water quickly. Don't drink too much water (a glass a time at most) or you'll throw up. That's it.
Darkness, climate control, and 2 days of rest/playing on my phone in bed. Then, I order food. Then, I take a shower, brush my teeth, drink some water, and go to bed. 
Take a shower, then get [Kebab](http://kebabemir.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/kebab1.jpg) and Powerade. Finish eating, second Powerade. Works like a charm for me.  
Toast! It takes away the nausea like magic. And it's basically the only thing to eat that won't make you retch, especially when you've just woken up.
I get a large beverage vessel. Not a cup, like a fucking jug or something. Half ginger ale, half orange juice, and enough butters to make the mix change from orange to a slight pink. Good to go in 30 minutes after drinking it. The taste is weird, but my lord that has crushed many hangovers. 
"Order a giant pile of combo fried rice. 

Pregame: 2 tums

The game: fried rice, Coke (for caffeine)

The post game: 2 aleve"
I usually fill a couple empty Gatorade bottles or water bottles (roughly 20 oz. each) in the sink and put them in the fridge. Gulp both directly before sleeping. Completely avoids the hangover every time.
"Go on a hike.

Exercise and/or light sounds terrible at the time, but something about moving around seems to work out all the icky."
Go to the steam room, followed by a cold shower.  Then drink a gatorade and take a multi vitamin.  The steam room will sweat out all of the alcohol and toxins, just remember to rehydrate afterwards.
B vitamins and Aleve before bed, with a big bottle of water. Maybe eat something. More like a preventative measure than a cure...haven't had a hangover in years.
"°pure unadulterated coconut water 

°vitamin B

°plenty of sleep

°either work out or go for a long walk the next day 

°hot shower or bath 

°a few bananas "
"Hangover eggs! Two things happen:
1) you throw them up and you feel a lot better.
2) you keep them down and feel way better.
3) you still feel like shit... What the fuck did you drink last night?"
If I have nothing really important to do that day, I'd prefer a good joint. Otherwise just some asprines with a lot of coffee.
Depending on how hungover you are. Eating something (Eggs, bacon and toast and berry juice) and smoking a bowl is key. If I can't stomach anything i'll make some ginger tea, really helps with the uneasy stomach part. I remember reading somewhere that berries have a lot of the vitamins that get depleted when your hungover.
I would swear by this back when I drank. I would get into college with a stinking hangover, head straight to the vending machine and grab an ice cold (has to be ice cold for some reason) Dr. Pepper. About 30 minutes after drinking it I started feeling better, not long after that, hangover was gone. My mates never believed me until they started trying it. 
Scrambled eggs (a little more salt than usual), hot coffe and mild orange juice. That and a long forest walk. Hangover gone in no time at all.
Pickle juice always does it for me. That and chicken noodle soup. Weed too. Take like, 2 gulps of pickle juice, smoke a bowl, eat some soup. 
If you feel like puking eat some antacids you'll feel better immediately. Learned this way too late in life.
1 piece of Bread and lots of water before I sleep. A bottle of red gatorade the next day (can always have more as well)
I just try to drink an equal amount of water while drinking. Tends to be a good preventative measure for me. After the fact? I've got nothing.
Cold shower, strong painkillers chased down with a double espresso, and a single cigarette. Works every time.
"I wake up. I go to the local convenience store and get a bottle of Gator/Powerade. Drink. Take an Uber to the local Vietnamese restaurant. Eat a large bowl of raw beef + tripe pho. Walk back home.  
  
That usually does the trick."
a nice greasy cheeseburger fixes me up every time. but really you just need to drink a lot of water before going to bed
Drink water throughout the night. A glass for every 2 drinks. Chug water before bed. Water first thing when you wake up. Oh and bacon. Anything with nitrates really.
Hydrate! My trick is to drink pedialite. It has more electrolytes in it than sports drinks. Also a good protein and carb filled meal and sleep. 
I usually go with Gatorade, a muffin, and a 3 hour epic of a movie. Pot helps too, but if you don't or can't it's optional.
"*Two asprin and a multivitamin before I go to sleep usually prevents it.
*There's this drink called Body Armor. It contains coconut water and vitamins to help with the dehydration and replenish electrolytes and nutrients. It works very well, if you can drink some before the nausea sets in (it doesn't taste great).
*I'm not really a weed smoker but I keep a joint around for these occasions. A few puffs can suppress the nausea and stimulate my appetite so that I can eat something nutritious and salty which usually helps.
"
Workout. Go for a run, a bike ride, a swift walk, whatever. The first 30 minutes will be hell, but once you sweat it out, it's gone for good.
"Exercise, more specifically cardio. It's hard to get yourself to do it when hungover but it blasts through a hangover. 

Source: Former Division 1 Athlete."
"The best way to prevent/treat a hangover is preparation.  BEFORE you go out drinking, place a bottle of gatorade, a glass of water, two Excedrin, and a multivitamin on your nightstand.  After you get home, go ahead and drink that water all the way down and take your vitamin.  The next morning, take your Excederin and wash it down with your gatorade.  Go back to sleep.  

After you wake up, take your ass to either Waffle House, Denny's, or IHOP (all depends on your preference), and get yourself lots of bacon, pancakes, eggs, and hashbrowns.  You COULD do this step yourself if you're not too bad, but usually if I am in need of this step, it's because I'm in a bad place and the effort of cooking is too much.  


Basically, you need to rehydrate (water and gatorade), replenish stripped nutrients (vitamin), restore your lipids (greasy ass foods), and stabilize your glucose levels (sugars from pancakes).  This should restore you to a state in which you can return mostly to normal in two hours or so.  

If you're not in the mood for breakfast foods, just about anything from Taco Bell is perfect.  When you get your drink, don't go for anything diet.  The boost of sugar will definitely help.

"
I've never had a hangover.  Then again, when I drink alcohol, I make sure that I am hydrated, I eat something and I don't drink until I pass out so that may be why.
Drinking Responsibly, But Usually An Ibuprofen with a glass of water before bed seems to help if you aren't to far gone to forget. As for the morning, Gatorade or anything to hydrate you back up.
"The Ocean.

If you can swim or surf, it rinses away the hangover. 60% of the time, it works everytime."
Pint of Diaoralyte electrolyte powder in a pint of cold water before bedtime to ward off alcohol-based dehydration. Then, if my head's still sore in the morning, I go for a hearty full Irish.
"Spanish frittata made the night before.

* fry onion, garlic, peppers, sausages together
* cover in potatoes
* cover in scrambled eggs
* layer tomatoes on top
* bake 350F for 1hr
* slice, serve with baked beans

Grease, salt, protein, and vitamins to help you recover, and it works wonders. Drink with a bloody mary to make it even better, because, my god, does hair of the dog work."
"Drink water while drinking. If you're already hungover, still drink water. 

Also, bloody Mary's without the vodka help a lot. "
"A Guinness, a bit of pot, and then going out for a good breakfast full of fat and protein.

A Guiness because it's light on the stomach and low alcohol and calories. (It feels good going down and will alleviate the alcohol withdrawl aspect of the hangover while providing a surprisingly decent kick of nutrients.)

Pot because it's awesome and just mixes great with the pint you just downed either right before the shower or during it...

And then leaving the house for a breakfast because you need eggs and some fat from sausage or weird hippy substitute. But if you're not too hungover to leave the house, a good walk will get the Guinness and pot flowing and the fresh air and views will do you well.

And if you're still feeling like shit then go ahead and go back home, smoke a bit more and maybe pop an Advil PM and nap it off, you've most likely had a longer night out than average."
Dual-wield all night. Main hand is liquor; off-hand holds water. Swi(n)g one, then the other. Maybe find some grub before you pass out. No need for a cure.
Put one of your thumbs in your mouth and the other in your ass,  switch every 30 seconds until hangover is gone.

Pho for sure.  Topo Chico.  When I lived in LA it was Ajarian Khachapuri... Look that up, I miss it so much.
After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, pan-seared in salted butter. I eat that, put on some wet socks and go to sleep.
"I discovered, back in my junkie days, that the definitive, absolutely best cure for a hang-over is burnt toast, black coffee, and heroin.

These days, a blunt, gatorade/freshly-squeezed orange juice, and a big greasy breakfast do wonders for the alcohol-throttled body."
Banana (potassium), Ginger beer (to settle the stomach), Gatorade (replace all those salts you pissed out). Then chicken wings, cause chicken wings are awesome
"Drink water between the alcohol. Drink water when you get home. Before you head out, place a filled water bottle beside your bed.

Walk for an hour to get home."
When I was in the military we used to let our docs practice giving IVs to us with saline.  Almost an instant hangover cure.
"As someone who has drank often for far too long, I have a few tricks I'm always sharing. 

First, if it's a night you know you're gonna get fuckered up, get the gatoraide series. They have the prime for before you're drinking, sip on the regular one as the night goes on, and leave the recovery one next to your bed for morning time. Boom golden. 

Impromptu shit show? Keep a bottle of b-12 at your place. Pretty cheap and does wonders. This plus a little greasy food you'll be bright eyed and bushy tailed in no time. 

Finally, if you have an awesome friend who's in the medical field, whether nurse or phlebotomist, someone who can safely stick you with a needle. Have them set you up with a banana bag. 15 min and boom let's start drinking again!"
After a long night of drinking I usually run a marathon the morning after. I throw up several times and it really clenses my entire body. Also I usually end up spending the rest of my afternoon in a ditch.
"It matters if it's a workday or not a work day.  If you are going to work, workout.  Get the heart racing.  You need at least 20 minutes, but a hour is even better.  Drink a lot of water.  If puking, don't fight it.  Cold shower.  If you still feel bad, hair of the dog and breath mints.  Try to avoid interacting with anyone at work.  Get a greasy breakfast.  

If it's not a workday, get some exercise, shower, and go back to sleep."
"Reefer, starchy food, water amd darkness.

My boy has a preventive measure that I've never tried and think to this day he's trying to trick me into something.....he chugs a big ass glass of MILK before sleeping on a night of heavy drinking. Anyone else heard of this?

It appears to work too, he always wakes up n starts his day while everyone else is laid out"
"It's cute when people that barely drink give advice ""just drink a glass of water before bed that will cure it"" LOL "
B vitamins and water. And some pho. And if you can get a salene drip do that. That hydrates you better than anything else. 
Stay constantly drunk. I'm honestly can't stop completely for fear that the cumulative hang over would kill me. 
Do not under any circumstances go to sleep until you are sober. You drink water the entire time as you wait to become sober and finish off with two advil right before you actually go to sleep. No hangover.
Big glass of gatorade and a multivitamin before sleep. If I forget that? I just take the multivitamin and chug gatorade all day. I usually feel better after eating a big greasy meal.
"It depends on the type of hangover.  If you're definitely going to be on the verge of puking the rest of the day, you might as well go to your closest fast food joint and load up on some ""hot garbage food"" as my old roommate would call it.  Chow down, wait half an hour, and then puke.  Followed by a toothbrush and coffee.  If possible, a swim in the surf completes the rejuvenation process.


If it's a minor hangover and it's just your head that hurts, I find that a little morning nookie (if possible, try to do it without either of you talking), then go eat an orange in the shower.


If none of that is possible, then Ramen noodles and a B vitamin work pretty well.
"
Throw up before bed. Never had a hangover but probably ruined my esophagus. Not recommended but works. 
"If you need to vomit, just vomit. You will feel instantly better.
Also, try to get up and moving as soon as possible. You will feel better if you just carry on"
Bojangles Cajun biscuit combo with cheese (egg optional). This also includes Cajun fries and a sweet tea
"Sprite. There was a study done that shows that it accelerates the breakdown of the compounds in your liver causing your hangover in the first place. I usually drink enough Sprite when I'm drunk to avoid a hangover all together the next morning. Typically 2 or 3 glasses of it. But also continue to drink water since Sprite isn't very good at keeping you hydrated.

Edit: [Here's an article talking about the study](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/sprite-hangover-cure_n_4071282.html)"
Drink water, sleep one more hour or so, take a good PWO get to the gym and get the toxins out and get some blood flowing. keep hydrated. If rly hungover, force puke, drink water and milk, take a walk. if rly rly rly hungover, puke, drink water and a shot vodka, shower, sleep.
A tylenol for the headache, a coconut water for the dehydration and then an orange to put some food in the tummy. If I'm really in a bad way I'll take a bath in the dark.
Lots of hydration. If it's a really bad hangover, you'll probably puke it up once or twice. Do it again, then take vitamins, then go for a light walk, then take a hot shower with a minty body wash. You might still feel like shit for most of the day, but you'll be functional.
Well, I just had a turkey sandwich with Wholly guacamole, pappadew havarti cheese, and romaine lettuce on Amish white bread, along with a can of Double Cola, and that seems to have worked wonders.
Gatorade, Tylenol, and some sort of greasy food. Usually Chinese, if I can find a decent place. I'm only 23 and feel like I get the hangovers of a person in their 30's. :/
"The best cure? Don't drink at all of course!

The best cure I've ever had was popping 3 percs, 4 muscle relaxers and a fat blunt. Fell asleep for the rest of the day, woke up completely brand new around 10pm at night, still blasted from the drugs."
Large Gatorade, four Advil, a big breakfast that I have to force myself eat slowly as to not get sick. 
Best thing is to prevent it... After you've reached the point of oblivion, you find your way to the closest giant greasy burger and devour it and wash it down with a huge Gatorade (or water).  Then when you wake up the next day you poop out your hangover
"LIQUID BUFFET! Coffee, juice, gatorade, soup, water, soda, red bull, more soup!
edit- and kirkland brand liquigels"
My cure starts before I go to bed. 2 Tylenol, 3 gummie  multivitamins, and WATER.  Then when I wake up I eat a decent breakfast.
"Drink so much water before going to bed that my stomach feels like its going to explode. Usually feel completely normal the next day except for being a bit tired.

I also put water next to my bed and drink it all in the morning as soon as I wake up and then pass out for another hour or so and feel great."
A couple of extra strength tylenol, then sleep. After you wake up, make a trip to a local fast food eatery to eat ALL the greasy things.
"The night before, you take 2 Motrins. Swallow it down with a full liter of V8. The next morning, V8 and a bagel with cream cheese and lox. Then you get in the shower. You start hot, then you slowly turn the temp down until the water is freezing cold and your nips are ready to cut glass. 
Then you have a cup of coffee. Done."
"Taco Bell. 
I don't even like Taco Bell that much but when I'm drunk/hungover it is the closest thing to heaven."
Eggs, coffee, excedrin, advil, gatorade, a shower, and walking my dog. No hangover can withstand all of that. 
Melatonin until I can wake up later and not be hungover. Literally skipping the entire day with naps if I have to. No I'm not sorry about it either.
"My very specific process that has gotten me back in the game for workdays starting at 6am (complete by 7am):

Turkey club w/ slightly burnt toast, bacon, heavy mayo, and cholula (can sub for a bacon/egg/cheese sandwich w/ same fixins)

2 purple vitamin waters (regenerate I think)

1 small espresso and >20oz dark, black coffee. 

3 ibuprofen chased with 12 oz water.

Force yourself to do some menial task (answer emails, etc) to keep the focus off your hangover and prevent self loathing/procrastination while listening to some upbeat music. To me this mental side is as important as the steps above.

"
If I'm *really* hungover I'll have a popsicle, lay on my side watching a movie or something and wait till I need to throw up. The most terrible thing during, but afterwards I feel so so much better.
water. before going to bed after a night of heavy drinking drink like 2L of water before going to bed. You'll wake up a couple hours later massive urge to piss. Piss drink another liter or more of water. You might wake up in the morning with a small head ache eat breakfast I usually eat eggs and bacon pop and Advil drink a bit more water and you'll be golden.
[Oral rehydration salts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_rehydration_therapy) dissolved in a glass of water, preferably before going to bed. Usually available at pharmacies or online.  We used to carry these in the desert to stave off heat exhaustion, but it turns out they kill a hangover just as effectively (just another kind of dehydration, right?).  The only downside is that they generally taste pretty terrible, but it's worth it.
Drink a lot of water and eat a slice of bread before you fall asleep. When you wake up, drink more water and add another slice of bread to your breakfast. This works for me every time.
"Lot's of water and a three mile run in layered clothing.

The run produces a fuckton of sweat and the endorphins help negate the hangover."
Take some Hydrodol tablets while you are drinking. It is supposed to stop you from getting dehydrated. 
"When i get home after a night out i get a big jug of water and put on a movie, crazy comedy or intence action to keep me alerted since boring parts risk me falling asleep. Works like a charm.  

Good movies: Tucker and dale vs evil, weekend at burnies, james bond (with timoty dalton or pierce brosnan), Aliens, Die hard, Taxi 2 (the french one), Terminator 2, Gone in 60 seconds...."
Eat ANYTHING, chug a bottle of water with excedrin, man up and take the dog for a walk, will feel 10x better by the time you get back.  The outside air always does the trick.
A hot shower, brush my teeth, then go to McDonald's. Cheeseburger (not a big Mac or anything, just the plain cheeseburger) and a large coke. You get protein, salt, sugar and caffeine. Perks you right up. I get fries too, but they don't help. I just really fucking like potatoes. 
When my buddies and i go on snowboarding trips, we get absolutely shitfaced. We pass around a 2 liter bottle of Pedialyte at the end of the night, and wake up firing on all cylinders even after 2 hours of sleep. Do this quite often during the snow season.
Milk thistle has been a miracle cure for me, I take it with a huge glass of water before passing out and then again when I wake up. Nothing else has been better.
Best solution is to stay hydrated either while drinking or before you go to sleep. I prefer to stay hydrated while drinking although that runs the risk of breaking the seal. I'd rather break the seal early than risk chugging a bunch of water before sleeping and somehow pissing the bed. Staying hydrated prevents hangovers. But usually I just eat some greasy ass food. 
"Drunkest i ever got - best cure was one of those banana shakes from booster juice. Felt better after literally minutes.

Mind you, this was after 3 days of hangover hell. Pretty sure i had actual alcohol poisoning. "
If I eat chips (fries) absolutely slathered in cheese and garlic sauce before I go to sleep I almost never have a hangover. 
Usually take half the dose of my multivitamin before bed with some water. Helps you get back some of the stuff that got diluted from all the drinking. Then Tylenol or whatever in the morning. And salty stuff.
"Go to a Thai restaurant. Order something that has the little chili pepper icon next to it. Ask them if they can make that ""Thai spicy"". Eat that and sweat out all the toxins. 

Other than that, mix your liquor with Gatorade when you drink. Cuts down on the dehydration factor, and can still be pretty tasty. "
I was told last night that chugging an Ensure before going to bed would prevent a hangover. Actually had some sitting around so I tried it, and I feel great today.
What I usually do is have a tall glass of water with a few aspirin right before I go to sleep, and the same when I wake up. Usually works like a charm. 
Drink a fuckton of Gatorade and then cardio/sweat it out. Yeah I know it fucking sucks, but you'll get all that shit out of you really quick if you can knock out a jog. It seems to cut my recovery time by several hours for reasons I can't explain 
"My wife put me into these. She has them wherever she is hungover but to me they are amazing when your stomach wants to send anything back up.

In the UK we can them wotsits. Cheesits in the US? The cheesy puff snacks that melt in your mouth. Because you can't stomach anything these dissolve and don't get put in the spew queue. You manage to eat and not spew. Helps a huge deal."
A bit of a different answer since everyone else here has said the usual cures already, but for me eating a nice fast food meal before going to bed drunk helps prevent hangovers.  My physique takes a hit but hey at least I don't feel like crap the next morning.
Bacon, eggs, fresh hash browns cooked in bacon grease.  Take b12, fish oil, magnesium, zinc, and kelp iodine.  Lots of water and green tea.  Dunno if this works for everyone, but this, a short jog to start sweating( it's miserable I know) then a cold shower and a 30 minute nap and I'm good to go all day.  
"Greasy Denny's ""Build your own grand slam"" meal. With extra food. Bunch of water, coffee, then a nap that occurs while trying to bang Miranda in Mass Effect. Duh."
The last two times I've drank heavily I had 5 ibueberophen and a few vitamin waters before going to sleep and haven't got a hangover. Last time I was hung over I drank a lot of water and had a five hour energy. That worked pretty well.
Sleep.  If I get drunk, sleeping works as a recovery for me.  However, it has to be uninterrupted sleep.  If I have to wake for anything other than zombie walking to the restroom to relieve my bladder, it won't work, I will still feel groggy.
pray. pray and sleep. and remember to take in about a gallon of water before you pass out.. and every time you wake up to pee, drink more water. I use saltine crackers and crying to melt the hangover away. neither are effective, but both make me feel less shitty.
When I get home I normally know if I will have a hangover in the morning. So I have this electrolyte powder that you dissolve in water and just drink. You will wake up in the morning like you didn't drink at all. Called elotrans and you get it in every pharmacy without a description. Thank me later. 
Antinausea medication, advil and gatorade.  Once those have played their part get some real food to balance things back out. 
"Salt + water + sugar + cup of coffee with sugar.

Coffee will force the body to shrink blood vessels that are slowly coming out of their widened state from the alcohol.  Water will rehydrate.  Salt and sugar replace what is lost when you begin to chug water as you realize what is happening."
I've woken up hungover in hospital a couple of times, first because I drank too much, the second time I drank too much and fell over. Both times an iv drip and the fear of my parent's reaction worked wonders. It's currently 2240 here and I'm still hanging from last night. Wish is read this this morning 
Bojangle's Cajun Filet biscuit with a large side of Bo Rounds.  For some reason, it really helps me with those rough mornings.
I know this won't help you now but maybe the next time you go drinking, it will help you out.  I don't have a hangover cure because I have never had a hangover.  When I come in after a night of drinking and before I go to bed, I drink a LOT of water.  At least 3 or 4 tall glasses, as much as you can possibly hold.  Take 2 acetaminophen with codeine and take another glass of water with you and put it by your bed.  If you wake up during the night, drink the water by your bed.  As soon as you wake up in the morning, drink more water.  A hangover is in large part caused by dehydration, if you can counter act it before it get hold, you can prevent a lot of suffering.
Our Saturday morning training ride, the paceline usually holds it mostly around 22 mph except for the sprints before the SAG at mile 31 and end at 44. 
Wake up, two extra strength advil, flat coke, and an hour long shower. Nap naked falling asleep to shitty movies. 
Drink water before you go to sleep, don't want it? doesn't matter, just drink it - as much as you can - keep a glass next to your bed so whenever you wake up you can drink more.  That stops the dehydration which is most of a hangover, other than that, if you feel sick then slowly eating a ginger biscuit or two.
"For me. Breakfast at Azuls. There's something about chips and salsa that starts the recovery process.
"
"Common misconception about hangovers is they're caused by dehydration... sorta ...

Breaking down [metabolizing] alcohol requires water in a multi stage process in your liver.  If you lack water alcohol is broken down into toxic substances and nothing more.  Excess alcohol is dumped straight into your blood unprocessed.

so if you drink too fast you get raw alcohol in your blood.  If you drink too heavy [over time] you get toxic byproducts in your blood.  Now, if you lack water your liver will give up a lot sooner but eventually your liver will give up during the night if you keep drinking regardless of water intake.

The easiest cure is to stop drinking after you get drunk or at the very least only have 1 or 2 more units at most beyond that point.

After that ya some water before bed will help but ultimately you'll get as sick as you have overdone it.  "
"First thing, huge glass of water and two or three Advil. Then I brush my teeth and take a quick shower. Then I have some yogurt and honey (for digestion) and bread or grains. Cereal, oatmeal, something that will soak up that crap in your stomach. Then another big glass of water. Finally, I go outside and get some fresh air. Just chill outside for ten minutes and drink some water.

By then I feel great, or at least halfway normal. If it's still lingering I'll try to take a nap at some point and by then I'm 100%."
"There is no cure. Drink lots of water and don't drink colored liqour such as whiskey or wine. Vodka is the good stuff.

That way it won't be as bad. Still gonna be pretty bad though."
Water, 6 eggs, a bagel and a banana. Then brush my teeth after that to get that taste out. 90% of the time it works every time.
Water and ibuprofen before bed then black coffee and greasy bacon for breakfast. When I worked at Sonic the steak and egg burrito was my go to if I had to work after drinking the night before. 
Prevention is better than cure! Have a litre of water when you get home, get as much sleep as physically possible (which may be very little if you're a student with morning labs or workshops like me) and if you do wake up with a hangover, get some Diaoralyte into you, followed by cheese on toast and a mug of tea. 
"Hydrolite, Asprin, Sleep. 

Try to start this when you're still drunk, like 4am and waking up to pee because you drank 7 steins last night drunk. Cancel any and all plans that don't involve hanging out with mates in a similar fragile condition. 

If you need to airtasker the hydrolite and aspirin component get them to buy you a pie and a latte too. 
"
udon noodle soup, or vietnamese pho without the beef. if it has to come back up, it's easy; the liquid helps rehydrate you and the salt and nutrients from the broth help sustain you. also coffee, no wank, definitely no wank, and hydrate hydrate hydrate. 
Not so much a cure, but I always go to the same  diner the next day once I get hungry and get a bacon cheeseburger with their fresh cut fries. It's fucking magic.
"Depends, sometimes my hangovers are physical other times they are mental, and sometimes a mix of both. Meaning, their are times that I cannot stop throwing up for 2-6 hours, and cannot even hold down a sip of water or food with intense stomach cramps/burning sensation. Throwing up to the point, where their is nothing left anymore. Slight shaking, getting real hot and cold, and sore muscles, foggy dreamlike state. 

Cure: Painkillers, whether the are opiates, or plain old ibuprofen, some caffeine, a good meal with a lot of protein, trying to stay occupied (But sometimes, I feel way too depressed to do anything but lay there). 

Mental hangovers- Feeling so depressed the following day(s) after drinking, but no physical symptoms. Other than a minor headache, mood swings, and feeling extra emotional and anxious more than normal. Worrying so much about things that don't worry me as much normally, feeling like something bad is going to happen. Feeling so depressed, and unable to enjoy doing anything. Going from real sad to normal to real sad to normal, and wanting to cry or think about a lot of sad painful memories

Cure: Exercise helps a lot, since it isn't a physical hangover, I can usually reduce some symptoms by working out, also if possible trying to keep myself occupied, drinking a lot of water, and just time.

It sucks."
"Before crashing: vitamin B and lots of water (really the water is the real saver) and Sealegs seasickness pills, especially as you get older.
"
Sleep, magnesium sulfate bath, water with electrolyte drips, and vegetable juice, Midol. All those things. Because fuck hangovers
"**Pre-Hangover Damage Control**  
No matter how drunk you are, try to ""re-establish some cognition"" before you go to bed - get yourself a nice big old glass of water, and drink it. And do it again. and again. Chug a lot of water until you can't take it anymore.  
Then, aim for 2 advil/tylennol - Then pass out. You should wake up feeling less like shit, but you may still feel uneasy.  
**If you can't do that then...**  
You're going to wake up feeling like you want to die. Drink a lot of water, coffee, and try to eat something (If you can get to McDonalds, do it).  
If you're lucky...make yourself puke. My god the amount of times I've felt great after puking 3 or 4 times...  
Then go about your day. "
Before going to sleep: 2 aspirins and 1 liter of water. You would be friggin amazed by how well it works!
"Alcohol: Glass of coffee, water, and orange juice. Then some biscuits and gravy.

Mushrooms: the biggest bottle of yellow Gatorade you can find."
"* 1x powerade
* 2x neurofen
* 1x shower
* 2x pieces of vegemite toast/plain chips/migoreng

Hydrate, headache control, shower = fresh feeling, salty food helps you absorb water. GG"
"Crying in the corner until it's over. 

That and a smoothie. If nothing is staying down you might as well through up something tasty. "
"Prairie oyster.

""A Prairie Oyster (or prairie cocktail) is a drink consisting of a raw egg, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, salt and ground black pepper."""
"Well, the first thing to go wrong with my body is ALWAYS a headache, so for me, hangovers = some of the worst non-migraine headaches of my life.

The only real way for relief is for me to sleep all day long, but when that's not possible, ibuprofen. There's nothing like the moment you realize you don't have a headache anymore; the absence of a headache is something you don't appreciate until you've just had one."
"A good shit is key.

Drink enough water that you can finally pee again.

I also find that the more I can sleep the better I feel. Catnapping after first waking up and taking care of the above usually leaves me pretty solid by mid/late afternoon."
"Alka-seltzer. I discovered this when I was so hungover and had to go to my company's Christmas party that night, and I have the ""Anything I eat will reappear in smoothie form twenty minutes later"" type of hangover. I had the weird thought that I always saw hungover people drinking Alka-seltzer in the older movies I sometimes watch, and thought, ""What the hell, might as well try it.""

It. Is. Awesome. It's now my insta-cure. "
Prevention. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. I do this whenever I drink, and have never gotten a hangover.
"I drink 26 ounces of water before bed. 26 ounces when I awake, then eat eggs, toast and bacon.

If I forgot to drink water, I go to the store purchases a few G2s and head to subway. "
Yogi fries, large greasy burger, water and something caffeinated. Also not waking up before noon if I can help it.
I don't fall asleep super drunk. I stay up and drink water til I feel mostly normal, and eat something if I'm not too full. 
"Sweat, self-loathing, cringing at past behaviors are my usual hangover symptoms, but now I can't tell if I'm just always hungover or just sweaty, self-loathing, and embarrassing to be around in general. 

Here's the Texas10-80 recommendation: Large, sealable bottle of slightly iced water, some bud, a dog. When your legs work, go outside, absolutely POUND as much water as you can until you throw up. Since you haven't eaten yet it'll be quite a pleasant purging. Then, chicken and waffles with a side of water. Go outside or to an outdoor range, put on lots ear protection, and target shoot. You won't have to exert yourself and it takes your mind off of being hungover. 

TL;DR: Maybe guns, probably just outdoor, low-impact, satisfying, repetitive tasks.

EDIT: My girlfriend just mentioned that my TL;DR may be symptoms of autism. Scheduling an appointment now.

1 Goody's powder, 2 benadryl, 1 hot ass shower, tale a poop, then greasy food and a good half gallon of liquids
I don't have anything to cure a hangover because I've never had one. But to avoid one always overhydrate before you drink so just drink a ton of water then every once in a while as you're drinking down some more water. You will still get drunk, on the 4th of July my friends and I got absolutely shit faced and zero hangover.
Pound water the night before. Breakfast and coffee until the need to shit followed by a shower and finally Excedrin and more water.
Walk down to the beach and get in the water for a bit. Afterwards go home, have a long shower and a good meal.
Lay in bed hating myself as long as possible. Then I sit in the shower and let the water run over me.
"Coke from the fountain with lots of ice.
If available, a can of Campbell's Tomato soup with a shot of vodka poured in. Serve that up with the greasiest grilled cheese you can make...all is right with the world. "
More a preventative than cure: Chocolate milk before bed and, if you can stomach it, when you wake up. 
"Join the military in a job that has combat medics attached, most combat arms roles will have them in abundance. Have that little freak practice setting an IV with a damn saline pack. 

After the first few times you'll stop drinking as much and you'll remember to drink water before bed.

Jk doc Herrera, love you bro.

In all honesty, if they set the IV right, you'll be golden within the hour. Also works for PT tests and such that you may cramp up during. Docs are worth more than their weight in gold."
4 to 5 crackers  before bed, large glass of water, next morning; two aleve, one large glass of milk, one piece of toast with  butter, one luke warm shower. Wash face with cold water.
Waffle House hash browns smothered and covered (cheese and onions on top) shitty Chinese take out and copious amounts of lemon lime gatorade 
20 oz. Powerade of choice mixed with 12 oz. can of caffeinated beverage of choice. Chase with water, vitamin, and a Tylenol Extra Strength, hangover shades, and more water.
Somehow a glass of water and 500mg of magnesium citrate gives me zero hangover, does anyone know why?
Water, bacon, and a vitamin c pill. Works better if you take a vit c pill before you fall asleep that night too
"When I drink, almost no matter how fucking drunk I am, I keep a gallon of water next to my bed. I always eat at least something (go to for me is a turkey sandwich) and take a few extra strength Tylenol. 

If I forget, I sleep as long as possible. I try and eat something really greasy, for whatever reason it makes me feel better. Water, rest, Tylenol. Blow jobs. For some reason blowing a load makes me feel not so hungover."
Taking a shit helps. Alcohol is absorbed through your large intestines when it absorbs with water. Getting the poison out with a good shit will be beneficial. Drink salty stuff. Pickle juice is hangover miracle potion. Osmolarity in you blood with the excess sodium will help with headaches. And of course, aspirin. 
Pre-emptive action is best. Mix a little lime juice, salt, and sugar with a lot of water and drink it as soon as you realize you're a little more drunk than you intended. The lime juice and salt replenish nutrients/electrolytes, the water rehydrates you, and the sugar makes it more palatable. Probably also useful after the fact, but best done before the hangover starts.
I've done the Gatorade, the pedialyte, the water, the showers, pain killers, and energy drinks. All of it. Greasy food tastes great during a hangover but the one thing that's actually helped me is one small cheap ass can of beer first thing in the morning. I never want it and it sickens me just before but I force myself to drink it and within 10 minutes I'm totally fine.  No headache, no fog, and not drunk. Perfect. 
"Chin a pint of water and 2 slices of buttery toast before bed, then have a room temperature irn-bru when you wake up. 

I used to keep the glass of water and two (covered) slices of bread by my bed so that I wouldn't forget to have them."
"Water before bed, Sleep, Gatorade, Sleep, Sleep, Wake up for dinner the next night, have something easy (fast food works too... preferably delivered) to eat, sleep, eat breakfast the following morning. Hope everything has stopped hurting.  

I wish I was in my early 20's again, where all it took was some greasy meal and an energy drink the morning of, rather than a whole lost day to sleep and feeling sorry for myself."
Big glass of water and 2 multivitamins. Then some toast, ham, bacon and eggs, tea (maybe with 12 sugars in it as per your taste). Then a good wank before you fall back asleep.
"There is no one size fits all, everyone is different as is every hangover depending on the factors behind the drinking session.  The best solution is not to drink to excess or at all (ahhahahaha), but generally speaking stay hydrated while you're drinking and line your stomach (with food) beforehand. Before I go to sleep, I try and get lots of water into myself and if possible, a Kebab or late night Maccas.

Of course, that doesn't always happen, so I always keep a bottle of Powerade handy to take the edge off and there are usually bananas in the house. After that, shower and walk up to the shops for an egg and bacon roll with coffee.

Drunk me is also a fan of what I call ""The Roman Maneuver"" - basically if I've drunk too much and have something to do in the morning I will *willingly empty the contents of my stomach* before going to sleep. I've only done this a handful of times, not because I felt sick or needed but rather because I had work in the morning, need to be fit to drive, and so made the conscious decision to kneel before porcelain altar.

I would not recommend this method."
Water before bed, followed by sprite when i wake up. Once its lunch time i go eat Pho and by then i feel great. 
2 eggs, whipped and cooked into an omelet type thing with fried onion and banana pepper rings and a slice of American cheese folded into a neat little pocket to fit onto a heavily buttered and toasted kaiser roll with two breakfast sausage patties. On the side is some really crispy corned beef hash with some Sriracha mixed in and combined half and half with cheese grits. 
Bottle of water before I go to sleep. Gatorade, a hearty breakfast and two multivitamins in the morning. Perhaps an advil if I'm feeling a headache coming on. Works like a charm.
Excedrin, or equivalent. I just buy the generic brand. 2 is usually enough, and more than likely the morning after. If I'm lucky, I'll wake up around 5-6 to piss, take a few then, and go back to sleep for a bit. Within 45 minutes, headache is mostly gone. I swear by it! Then a big old plate of eggs and bacon isn't bad. And a greyhound.
"Pickled sausages in vinegar [Uopenci] (http://www.czechcookbook.com/pickled-sausage-recipe-utopenci/) (you can eat this all day.

Lots and lots of water. A glutathione supplement. Carbohydrates like brown rice with maybe some eggs. A shower. Brushing my teeth. More water, and maybe some tea. Works like a charm. 
My mother works as a nurse in the hospital. Her cure after a long work party is to hook up a few IVs stolen from work. 
Steam room and a lot of water while I'm steaming. It also helps if your gym has a sauna, a whirlpool, and a swimming pool for a cold water plunge after you're over heated. 
"There's no instant cure ya know. But to bring relief much faster, I have two.
A very hot-as-you-can-stand shower, and then switch the water suddenly to as cold as you can stand it like almost all the way cold, stay under that for a few minutes, then hot again, then cold again, I get out feeling better already. The sudden change in body temp reverses the hangover or something. 
Drink green tea! I get it cold from a fast food place, a gas station, or anywhere. It doesn't matter the brand. Drink a while bunch right away, it's ok if it gets thrown up. Just keep drinking it!"
Water and Tylenol. The Tylenol is tough on your liver who is already having a bad day though, so use sparingly.
Not getting them. I've done lots of binge drinking and the worst I've gotten the next morning is a bit of dizziness
"Hot bath with a shitload of ground ginger, baking soda, and apple cider vinegar. Soak for at least 30-45 mins.

You'll start to sweat your ass off after about 10 minutes. This is normal. For best results, keep adding hot water when needed.

Probably drink water or pedialyte while you're in there too. Stand up slow, or you could pass out. Put on CLEAN sweatpants and a shirt, and lay down for about a half hour. You'll feel exhausted, but clean and pure. It's truly an amazing feeling.

Just DON'T put lotion or anything on your skin after the bath, because your pores are wide open."
Well, we've seen the British answer, now allow me to present my Canadian answer. During winter, you go outside for a 20-30 minute walk on a -20C day. By the time you get back, you've not only forgotten that you have a headache, but you also forget why you subjected yourself to that in the first place and you quite likely need another beer.
Bacon sandwich. Bonus points for being on a bagel or having hot sauce on it. Followed by a few large glasses of water/Gatorade, a few Advil, and a hot shower 
I am 99% certain that I am partially or completely immune to hangovers.  I have drank myself almost blackout drunk more than 1 time and never had even a sign of a hangover.
As someone who was frequently hungover, I - besides sipping water or Gatorade - always felt mentally better by just showering and putting some normal, non-sleeping, clothes on. No matter how much I just wanted to lay there and wallow, the simple act of a shower made me feel a ton better. Plus if you puke, you're right in the shower.
"A sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich on a roll, a ginger ale, and a green gatorade. Then a shower, brushing your teeth while in the shower, and a nap. Works every time.

Unless you're throwing up. Then laying on the bathroom floor for a few hours and wondering if you're dying usually does the trick. "
pickle juice before bed, take a few advil in the middle of the night, wake up and drink a redbull. Never have one when i do this
My key is what I do the night before.  Drink a ton of water before I go to bed and try my best to be as sober as possible before I drift off.  A little coconut water doesn't hurt either.
"I just tried out those ""hangover cure"" shots they sell in liquor stores, shit worked wonders

Other options: chilaquiles breakfast and getting up & moving around  "
I take vitamin B and Aleve before I go out as a pre-emptive strike. Before I go to bed I take them again if I remember. Then again when I wake up. Lots of water and an ice pack that I alternate between my forehead and the back of my neck. I seem to crave tomato based products so I'll usually do scrambled eggs with salsa if I'm functional enough to cook or tomato juice if I'm not.
Drink as much Gatorade as physically possible the night of before bed. Wake up and pick up McDonald's hash browns and egg sandwich and an Xl gatorade. Wash 3 excedrin down with said gatorade. Proceed to binge watch Netflix in bed.
"I take two Advil gel caps with at least 8oz of water just before bed. If I don't exceed my limit of 4 drinks, this makes for a great sleep and very little hangover in the morning. First thing the next day, I get up and take two more Advil, and drink buckets of water until breakfast, which is usually greasy and accompanied by ~4 cups of coffee.

(Obligatory responsible adult disclaimer: if you drink a lot, taking Advil before bed might not be your best option. Please be careful when ingesting any medication without the advice of a medical professional, and drink responsibly.)"
I have a question myself.  Why is it that after a night of drinking I rarely get a headache, but feel quesy instead?
I drink a warm mug of chicken broth, the salt helps you stay hydrated and refuels your electrolytes. 
I read somewhere that breakfast foods like sausage and eggs are good. I like to get a sausage/egg/cheese bagel from Wawa
Water, and some sort of physical activity.  Gotta get the blood flowing (just as long as it isn't running, pushups or climbing is good).
"Don't think on an empty stomach and have water between drinks, or mix your drinks with water instead of soda. 

The best cure is don't get one. "
If you forget to drink water the night before, the following morning the best solution is Gatorade, Tagamet, and 2 Advil.  The Gatorade is to restore the electrolites, Tagamet is to settle your stomach, and the advil is for the pounding in your head. It works miracles.  A nice nap helps too! 
Take a multivitamin before drinking, or before you pass out if you're coherent enough. Drink water before you pass out. Take an Advil the next morning. Worked every time.
I just load up on carbs while drinking, works for whatever reason. I can probably count on my fingers the amount of times I've had a really bad hangover
Agreed. Ghetto Fabulous, at that. They don't serve fries. Del Taco makes the best fries. This situation is just messed up. 
"go for a mile run. it hurts like hell, but, run, get back, eat food, drink water, take a nap. You're back in business. Your body just needs a swift kick to get going.

i learned this after my old method of wake up and smoke cigarettes wasn't getting me anywhere."
"Just went through a miserable hangover after drinking wine last week. 

Said, ""I'll know, i'll make a 3-way with some skyline, that should settle things"".


I was in for a fucking surprise. After 2 hours of feeling like puking i managed to shamble to the kitchen and make some alka-seltzer. Took a drink and immediately ran to the bathroom and puked my guts out.

Then I went to my go to hangover cure: fetal position in my bed, as dark as the room can get and wishing for death. 

tl;dr: fetal position can go a long way."
A bowl of juanitas menudo in a can, or Walmart fried chicken...I don't know why they work. They just do 
Drink as close to twice the amount of water as you do alcohol while you're drinking. I heard my dad talking to his friend about this when I was a kid and have never had a hangover. 
"1. Drink as much water as I can stomach before passing out 

2. While drinking the water, take 2 aspirin BEFORE bed 

3. Roll out of bed and shower

4. Drink some coffee 

Step 2 is key for me"
"Oxygen - Used to work as a lifeguard and we had emergency oxygen that we would be required to ""check"" regularly and refill the cylinder if it dropped below 75%. Which seemed to happen a lot because..

Breathing straight oxygen for a couple of minutes cures a hangover."
"If I have school/work; Amaretto(yes, more alcohol), some sports drink, and tea.

If it's just the night after a party, I put on my lounge trousers, a large hoodie, my noise cancelling headphones with Chopin playing and make myself the best damn breakfast burrito possible with whatever I have in my freezer"
Drink an EmergenC right before you fall asleep. Friends thought it was just my myth. Every single one of them does it now. Doesn't matter how drunk you are.
"Grapefruit juice, preferably before bed (if the bitterness/acidity won't make you puke), but the morning is fine too. None of the from concentrate shit either. Doesn't work. 

Why? Cause you're dehydrated as fuck and grapefruit is super good for your liver. 

Try it. Now. Seriously, go buy a bottle of whisky and grapefruit juice, get wasted and then drink the grapefruit juice.

Not because you're an alcoholic, but for science. "
Fried egg on English muffin, one spicy V8, one Gatorade G2 lemon lime. If that doesn't work, BC Powder is magic. If you still feel like shit after all that, you're pretty much fucked and should just go back to sleep forever.
I am a life-long sufferer of chronic migraines. As such, I have a continual prescription for the migraine drug sumatriptan (aka Imitrex/Imigran/Treximet). Shit works wonders for my migraines, but took me 20 years to ask the doctor about it. Anyway, turns out, shit knocks out a hangover completely in about an hour - it's fuckin' awesome. Highly recommend for either affliction. 
Try to hold down bile and liquor, throw up, somehow manage to make bacon and hashbrowns or some other greasy mess, drink a cup of water, then go back to sleep. I mean, fast food and some electrolyte-rich drinks would be ideal but I'm not getting up and driving when I'm hungover. Also in my experience, if you drink water in between shots or drinks, you can wake up feeling fine. And drink a cup of water before sleeping the night of.
This may not be of help to you right now, but next time, take a Tylenol pm before you go to sleep. You'll get good sleep and no headache. It's my drinking go-to!
Pho.  It's a surefire relief of even the worst hangover.  This is after the essential brushing of your teeth and taking a shower of course..
Three ibuprofen, meatball sub, and strawberry Eegees. You get the painkillers, meat, bread, and a ton of sugar and ice. 
I know it's too late to be preventative, but... bottle of water and some OJ before falling asleep. I'm not sure why the OJ works so well, but it's the key for me. 
My father told me to rub onions on your testicles... This works if you're blacked out drunk... My dad and his friends were in Cancun and one of his friends drank too much. He was about to pass out drunk... So my dad went to the hotels restaurant and asked for an onion and he cut them up and told his friend to rub them all over the nuts. 10 minutes later he felt just fine.
"The best hangover cure is to not get one in the first place.

Drink a good litre to 2 litres of water before you go to sleep and you won't get nearly as bad of a hangover. I remember being extremely drunk to the point I could barely even walk. I was walking down the dorm hallway and had to use the wall. Before I went to sleep though, I remembered to drink a whole bunch of water. When you're crazy drunk ""A whole lot of water"" is like an obscene amount. I filled up a 1L bottle twice and chugged it all then stumbled to bed.

When I woke up I had a mild headache and that was it. Drink plenty of water and get enough sleep = best hangover deterrent."
Milk. I drink a couple glasses of milk and my headache is gone or not as severe and my nasea is gone.
Not to be this guy, but drink plenty of water and get tons of rest. That's about all you can do. Make sure you eat before you drink and are hydrated. You can also drink water between drinks or right before you go to bed.
"Some water. Tylenol. Pepsi Max (caffeine to help wake up). and a 1-a-day multi-vitamin.    But honestly what do I know. I'm reading in here looking for ideas.  

I try to drink some water before bed."
"Gatorade right after drinking is done. Salty greasy comfort food. Take a piss, even if you dont feel it; then more gatorade just before bed. Aim for 6 hrs minimum sleep. 

 Substitute electrolyte drink of your choice if need be. 

"
30 oz of water before bed roughly, and take advil before bed if you think it might be really bad. usually though i just wake up and take 2 or 3 advil liquid gels and lay in bed and try to sleep. youll zone out and in about 30-45 mintues relief floods my body. Those liquid gel advils work amazing.
Gatorade mixed drinks the night before. Saved me tons of times. Especially when making jungle juice for college parties.
"Drink about 2-3 glasses of water after I get home. Then a giant bottle of Gatorade right before bed. Wake up, greasy food. 

Edit: Can substitute pedialyte for Gatorade, it's a lot lower in sugar. "
"In Spain we often say drinking another beer in the morning will kill the hangover.

Never tried it though. I usually have bread and Powerade"
"I know I'm late to the party here, but I've gotten pretty good at the whole hangover prevention game. My friends call me the hangover fairy! 

Prevention is really key here though so if you're already hungover, this stuff helps but is not as effective. 

-HYDRATE! Throughout the night and before bed and again when you wake up. 
-EAT! A big greasy meal is super effective at coating your stomach and breaking down alcohol. 
-TUMS! Coat the lining of your stomach before drinking with a couple Tums to reduce acid.
-PRETOXX! This shit's the real miracle. They're vitamins you take before drinking that contains milk thistle. It's amazing. Similar to other hangover pills but this is the one I've tried that works the best (although it's not cheap, but they do have a coupon on their website.) If you don't have that, an emergen-C or multivitamin is better than nothing.
-GET DRUNK! That part is easy 
HYDRATE, REMEMBER?! A one to one ratio with your drinks if you can! 
-EAT AGAIN! Eat something before bed.

When you wake up you'll be 10 times better off than if you did none of these things. Make sure to keep hydrating, take more vitamins, and continue eating comfort foods. I have a great Ramen bar nearby :) 


"
In order: two Advil,  a large Gatorade made from way too much powder, drank with a straw so you get all the goodness at the bottom. Once you're half to 3/4 of the way done with that, 2 tums. But your stomach still hurts, you're hungry but you're nauseous. Big glass of whole milk to top off the cure. It gives you back all those nutrients,gives you a little protein to keep your stomach digesting, and settles everything down. 15-30mins to normal.
"I used to employ a strategy of lying around audibly moaning for a few hours while trying to fall back asleep. Sometimes the best thing is to just get up and get moving. Sitting in the shower letting the water pour over you, in a sense washing away the filth of the night before goes a long way.



Now I swear by a supplement I found that claimed to prevent hangovers (you take one with your first drink of the night) and so far they haven't let me down.


You still can wake up feeling a little off, but nothing compared to the jackhammer against the skull, kill me now, hangovers I used to experience. "
"Passion shaken ice tea lemonade (sweetened) from Starbucks. 

It is what Jesus would drink if he were hungover. "
Not a cure but a vaccine, when you are ready to pass out, chug all the water you can fit, hangovers are mostly dehydration.
I have some toast with vegemite, a big coffee and a tub of yogurt. By the time I'm finished I feel fine.
"Sex, then a beef burrito from this place at the local markets...that closed down a few months ago. 

Now I just have sex. "
"Well it USED TO BE subway breakfast. Back when they had the sausage patty things. That and cheese and tomato cured my hangovers. My god the s,ell alone cured them. 

Then subway got rid of the sausage patty things :("
"Bottle of smart water with a sachet of dioralyte or your favourite rehydration powder mixed in there so you don't taste it. Get that down your neck. I shower if I can, brush my teeth, take 2 migraine pills then get straight back to bed and sleep. 
"
"I have never been able to cure a hangover - even when I was a teenager and hangovers weren't too bad.

Mostly mine last around 2 days. I partied way too hard and damaged my liver so on the odd occassion I do drink heavily now my hangovers hit me into the ground like a tent peg.

Usually it's at least 3 pints of water or squash and an electrolyte supplement before bed.

Wake up, shudder at how much life sucks, have a piss the colour of katie price, peel my crusted up eyes back.

More water, coffee, porridge, banana, paracetemol, hot shower. Then I might have a monster rehab if I have one (that helps a little) and try and keep moving/ keep active. I can't stomach a Full English in the morning at the best of times although I do love them.

I tend to find if I sit still the hangover sinks in, if I move around and don't stop it's painful but it's not as bad, it's tolerable. So I'll go do housework, I'll do some maintenance on the bike, tend to the garden, go dig the allotment, bake, cook. I basically keep myself as busy as possible.

I also avoid screens of all kinds, pc screens in particular amplify my hangovers. TV does if I watch it too early.

At regular intervals I drink plenty of fluids and eat something to keep hydration and blood sugar levels up or life does really begin to suck.

Day two is mostly about keeping hydrated, if I let it drop I get horrific headaches."
eggs and bacon, cycle through a glass of water, a bloody mary, a coffee, in that order, until you feel better. 
"I stopped having hangovers little over 6 months ago, I don't know why and I don't care but it's awesome. The only thing which gives me a hangover is unfiltered beer and I avoid drinking it when I know I want to get drunk.

But the best cure is just drink water during drinking or before going to bed."
"Water and bread before you go to bed. bread to soak it up, water to stop the headache. Wake up take a paracetamol and chug more water. Have a coffee or a tea with sugar (or a sugary drink if neither of those tickle your fancy) protip: if you have access to irn bru just get one they're literally made for hangovers.
Then get breakfast, bacon butty is best butty, then have a shower, clean your teeth. And an hour later you'll feel right as rain. 

Also if you feel a bit sick just make yourself sick. Better to get it all up than let it process all night so you just wake up feeling even more shit."
One antacid, one raddler, two ibuprofen, one 5 hour energy, one multivitamin, and a long, hot shower.  It's enough to get you through a day of work, but you'll crash HARD when it all wears off.  Time and water are your best long term solutions.  Fried chicken helps me too.
Eating regularly and drinking enough water while drinking and after drinking so that I don't get the hangover in the first place. 
New England clam chowder, Gatorade, vitamins, and coffee. The hangover is gone in an hour or two every time.
Water, Lucozade, tea and beige food. Sleep if possible. Put off showering for a few hours as it always makes me feel worse. 
I'll start with Pedialyte and Advil, then have something greasy like scrambled eggs, hash browns, and cheddar cheese on sourdough grilled in the same pan the hash browns were cooked in and make a breakfast sandwich. After that, do as little as possible and drink a lot of water and sleep. 
NAC before drinking; eat food before hand, vitamin B complex with food before drinking if possible. Lots of water before, during, after. Vitamin C before bed. Electrolyte drink powder when I wake, and a vitamin B with food. I have not had more than a very mild hangover in 15 years. Works for me.
In college, drink a bottle of gatorade when i woke up, go back to sleep, drink another when i wake up.  Now, a full Irish breakfast.
"For me, it's water all the way, baby.

Even though I'm 21, I will get awful hangovers. Although less so when I drink cider...I do not know why.

But when I'm feeling proper drunk, I'll start asking for water in between each drink I consume; down a pint of water, then your drink...rinse repeat, then have another pint before bed. THEN, two pints when you wake up...it sounds like a lot, but if you're on a heavy night, it works wonders...

Compared to the times I haven't drunk any water, holy shit."
A fry! Bacon, sausage, 2 fried eggs, Black pudding and lots and lots of toast! all washed down with a cup of strong barrys tea!!
"I have found nothing will magically cure it, there is little that can be done the night before either. Partly as the more drunk you are, the worse the hangover and the less likely you are to take vitamins or swap every other drink for water. 

I usually wake up really restless and feeling terrible quite early, so I force myself to get up. I have a few (soft) drinks, eat something (even if it means forcing it), take a shower and generally sort my head out. Then go back to bed and sleep it off. 

A lot of people saying hangovers get worse as you get older. I find they have got better if anything. Once you have kids and nights out become few and far between and you are used to lack of sleep, feeling like shit at 5am is quite normal. "
Eat a large flank steak, pan-fried in salted butter. Then I put on a pair of wet socks and go to sleep. 
Honestly, when I have a hangover, but shouldn't (like only drank two or three beers) I just take an Aleeve and it gets rid of it. However, when i've really fucked up and drank like 24 beers, I take nothing and deal with the pain.  I do this to remember how much it hurts the next time I drink so that I won't drink so much. Usually,  this type of negative reinforcement works pretty well. I only forget my lesson every year or two and get a painful reminder.
2 pints of water as soon as I get in from a night out, plus one to take to bed. Then a run in the morning when I get up. Nothing clears the head like some cold air and sweat
Water, aspirin, some food, light exercise/activity, shower and brushed teeth. Exercise can be really really mild, you just need to get up and move around. For instance yesterday I cleaned my apartment and my hangover was gone. Yoga works really well too. Just find a yoga thing on youtube and follow along.
"This is Dr. Burke from Hangover Heaven.  I read through a bunch of the posts in this thread and there is a lot of good information here.  In the end, it is much easier to prevent hangovers than to deal with them the next morning.  Dehydration is one component of hangovers, but the two bigger issues are oxidative stress and inflammation.  These two issues become more problematic once you hit age 30.  It is just harder to recover from anything once you are about 30 years old.  Recovering from a marathon, hangover, sprained ankle or whatever is harder.  

Oxygen helps the headache a bit, as well as the ""fuzziness.""  

The best thing is to take something before you start drinking or, at least before you go to bed.  In a pinch, take 2 multivitamins and some advil.  Pedialyte helps as well.  Antioxidants, such as milk thistle, taurine, and N-acetyl cysteine are good ideas also.  "
"Mine is http://noonelikesahangover.com .

i have been doing great since having it. no more sober days."
Don't pound water like these assholes recommend, you'll be up all night pissing. Set your alarm for 6am, take a Vitamin B Pill, and Two Asprin with some water. Go back to sleep for an hour or so, you'll feel fine when you wake up.
Drink a lot of water and exercise. You're trying to flush alcohol out of the body, and that can only be done by speeding up all metabolic processes.
Rhodiola Rosea, Ashwagandha, l-theanine, some scrambled eggs with hot sauce and toast with plenty of water.
Surprised no one said cocaine. A little bump of that medicine and you're back to normal in no time. Better than normal in fact. 
"Cocaine or more booze. And to lessen the come down of the coke you use booze or more coke.

Yay crippling depression!"
Berocca followed by ibuprofen and lots of water.  Also calling in sick and sleeping in a dark, quiet room.
"Step one: Chug bottle of water & take 3 ibuprofen.

Step two: Double Bacon Biscuit from a fast food establishment. 

Step three: Hot Coffee or Energy Drink of your choice.

Step Four: 1 Gatorade/1 Coconut Water/ 2 Bottles of Water

--

This process has never failed me. The best thing I do now when I know I'm gonna run a gauntlet of poor decisions the night before is, right before I go to bed, I take 3 ibuprofen and chug a bottle of water."
"1 shower + 1 jug full of water + 1 big fucking bowl of maggi = best breakfast/hangover cure



Also, having friends over to discuss the goings on of last night as well as a TV to watch as background noise while your brain un-fries is a nice addition"
Dulse. Its a type of seaweed that is purple and harvested in New Brunswick and Maine among other places. Its got all the electrolytes. So you drink a few litres of water and eat up some Dulse. 
"The correct answer is preventing it from happening but that's never what you want to hear.

Try to go back to sleep. Depending on how bad it is, you might not be able to hold food or even water down, you'll be all shaky and shit and life will be pain and you can't focus on anything but the throbbing. Try as hard as you can to fall asleep. There is no hangover in dreams. Just a little time machine to move things along faster. You'll have trouble getting to sleep but if you *can* keep food down, just eat a big fucking meal, preferably with red meat and let the food coma cradle you in it's sweet sweet arms."
"Sceintifically, just chug a 1L bottle of water before you pass out. Dehydration is the big cause of hangover headaches and nausea. That or drink Gatorade while you're drinking. 

Personally, I love a good bowl of menudo with lots of jalapeño and onion. "
"Glass of water before bed. Followed by pouring a glass of water for later. Wake up an hour later to pee then drink the already poured glass of water then eat a banana.

No hangover when you wake up."
64oz of iced tea or coffee and going for a gentle walk. The walk works best for me if it's a sunny day but the sunlight isn't direct. 
A pint of water when you come in after a night out. Then pop a couple of paracetamols the next morning followed by a strong coffee. Also if your still feeling rough halfway through the day, a cup of green tea should sort you out 
"worked at a bar and club and etc. so i've seen all the solutions, but this is what worked best for me:

DRINK WATER.

To delve into a bit more detail:
I come home from a crazy night out, and I try to stay up at least 30 minutes so I can drink a good 3 cups of water before going to bed. Being hydrated is so godamn important to not getting a hangover the next day.

I try to wake up relatively early the next day. i take a piss, i drink another glass of water and i go for a quick jog. i come home, take a shower, take another glass of water, jump into bed, surf the web a little bit and go back to bed for about 2-3 hours. by the time i wake up its around noon and i feel fucking great."
A glass of chocolate milk followed by a glass of orange juice. It sounds weird, but it really works. 
"Lots of water followed by a glass of sweet tea and a plate of fettuccine alfredo works for me every time.  As others have said, if you drink a lot of water the night before, no ""cures"" are needed."
Have a single migraine and then get that hangovers really aren't that bad.  Once that happens, they're quite manageable.
"I got room spinning, I'm just gonna lie down here on the floor for a few hours drunk after a bottle of wine and a jacuzzi at a party.

The next day unplug the phone, cancel my appointments headache/hangover was all the cure I needed.  Have never gotten hungover since."
"Hot shower, vitamins, thistle milk and a cup of builder's tea.  If you can face food, go for it!

Another cure is a Bloody Mary, trust me on this.

[](/GNU Terry Pratchett)"
"Average alcohol hangovers: Advil, redbull, pedialyte, and some food (usually mexican or pho)

If my skull feels like it's separating I'll include smoking weed and get In n Out with a chocolate shake."
Bacon, water, coffee.  It's my Sunday tradition. Can't smoke dope anymore personally, but a bowl definitely helped me back when I could. 
"Hydration with electrolytes (AA drink/gatorade).

Or if you're up for a challenge: Sweat it out somehow. I have an IR sauna at home and with 45 minutes of hell (you don't want to be in there at that point) you've discarded the majority of what makes you feel so bad and you'll feel good within the hour again.


Or just get another beer and get a bit tipsy. Your body will go back on processing the alcohol rather then the other nasties."
Best cure is more booze. Sounds like the worst idea ever, but it works. Also diet coke or come zero seems to help a little. Only thing scientifically proven to stop a hangover? Prickly pear juice. Go figure.
Try to be preventative with drinking tons of water before passing out. If you don't, when you wake up: 1. Get up and throw up/take a dump 2. Smoke a bowl 3. Drink at least a 8 oz glass of water with a couple of advil 4. Go back to bed... when you wake up you'll feel much better and will be ready to eat. 
"Ive had some very nasty hangovers in  my college days and I can tell you the best way to get through it. 

First off. Prevention. Before you pass out try to force a couple of glasses of water down and try to eat some food. This should eliminate most of the symptoms. However if you don't do this do the following:

1. Smoke weed as soon as you wake up 

2. The weed will stimulate your appetite then you need to eat some food. 

3. After you got some food in you system, go to the gym and squat. I am not kidding. Just squat. Then squat some more. If you are a lifter don't worry about any big weight, just squat something. 

4. Go in the steam room at your gym/ or a hot shower if you dont have access. 

5. You are no longer hungover. "
"If I know I had too much, and will regret doing so, I take one ibuprofen and as much water as I can stomach, then go pass out in something soft (preferably my bed). This takes care of the worst of it.

Once I wake up, eat something meaty and greasy, bacon and eggs will do, or just a sandwich with some delicious meat on top, maybe some cheese, just something nice and delicious. Then once I start to feel better, eat a proper meal and it's usually gone by then.

EDIT: Also, if I don't plan on driving, a good morning beer helps a lot. "
Beer, shower, showerbeer, more beer, then some greasy food. Sex if possible. Spend the next day in bed.
"Choose any two of the following. 
1) chug water and coffee
2) start drinking again
3) physically engaging work, i.e. yard work."
Water before bed, water/electrolytes/fresh juice when you wake up, roll a blunt and then eat something spicy as hell or something with a lot of bread. 
"Bloody Caesar, the clamato hydrates, gives you some nutrients, and the vodka acts as ""hair of the dog"""
"First off, water. Chug water like a mofo.

Food. Even though greasy, fried food is what you crave most during a hangover, something more healthy and less food-coma inducing is actually better. If you like, have a coffee for a little bit of energy.

Then, go run or work out or something semi-physical. (Obviously keep it fairly light or you'll be yakking in the bushes). It fucking sucks, and getting the motivation to do so when hungover is hard as hell, but nothing beats a hangover like sweating it out.

Then shower and nap. Or maybe a bit of a bloody mary."
A little bit of hair from the dog that bit you. Wake up hungover as hell. Pound some water and have a drink of what you were on last night. Re hydrate and your buzz will help you deal with the pain until the water kicks in. Also good fatty food
Monster Rehab and a cigaret followed by a salad pizza after my stomach has settled down. Plus tons of water and 4 or 5 paracetamol in one go. 
"I bite my toenails.     
I bite my toenails and save them in a mason jar.     


Once the jar gets somewhat full I take a few out to chew, or I just rummage my fingers through it.     
Once it is completely full I blend them into a powder and put the powder into a smaller jar and start  filling the large one again. I lick my finger and dip it in the toenail dust and eat it like a dip stick.          


I've taken some of the coarser powder and mixed it with shower gel for the abrasive properties, but once it's been sitting for a while they lose their roughness. 
I once mixed fine powder with toothpaste to see if it would act as a sort of fine sandpaper, it was too messy to try more than once and frankly, I thought it was a bit too weird. "
I just get up drink water and go on with my normal routine. And try not to bitch about it. And keep drinking water. Once i work up a sweat I'm good
Shower followed by; plain aspirin, lemon lime soda, marijuana. With the last one it's important to remember that you aren't trying to get messed up just enough to help settle your stomach, help with aches and pains, and increase your appetite so that you can manage to put some greasy food on your stomach. And of course after all of this drink lots and lots of water. W
"I engage in medical science to cure my hangovers.

A hangover has 3 main components.

1. Dehydration, alcohol is diuretic and makes you dehydrated. The fact drunk me sleeps with mouth wide open doesn't help any either. 

2. Low blood sugar. This causes the body to crash and feel shitty and weak. 

3. The worst, hangover withdrawal. The shakes, the sweats and the stench. 

Therefore the best cure because science is.... Hair of the dog. A breakfast of a  Vodka and Irn Bru (or any other mixer) tackles all the issues; it hydrates, it gives you a sugar fix and ot cures the withdrawal symptoms. 

TL:DR Drink more booze. 
"
"Avoid it. Smoke weed instead of drinking. 

Smoke weed after drinking the next day when you feel like shit."
Without a doubt, the [Caesar](http://cocktails.about.com/od/vodkadrinkrecipes/r/bloody_caesar.htm). Or if you don't want to get back on the booze wagon, chugging a bunch of gatorade and forcing a few more hours' sleep.
"weed. I would wake up feeling like shit and smoke a bowl. 10-15 minutes later I'd be all like ""did I feel like shit a few minutes ago? lol""

also, you can totally avoid hangovers by smoking weed instead of drinking in the first place. but to each their own."
"Before bed: 1 multivitamin, 2 Tylenol, at least 32oz of water.

Morning: 2 Tylenol, more water, and then greasy fast food once you are able to walk around and feel your stomach can take it. Or, if you're in the position to do so....weed."
Usually a pint or 3 does the trick... just don't overdo it cause if you just spend the day drinking and double-off the hangover til the next day you'll be in a world of hurt.
gatorade all day before i drink big then if i get a hangover after that just gotta chill out with some smoke.
"BC Powder, shotgun a beer (or drink a Bloody Mary), and chug 2 bottles of water.  Instantly 5x better.

Then go spend an hour on the toilet to rid your body of all that PBR, ya hipster. "
"Ahh, the four S's. Shit, Shower, Sandwich (or any food), Smoke (I like pot to cure the headache and any nausea). Also drink tons of water and gatorade. There is no actual ""cure"" but those do help make you not feel as shitty."
"- Drink a glass of water before sleeping. Smoke some weed before sleeping.

- Drink a bigger glass of water in the morning when you wake up. Smoke some weed when you wake up. Don't smoke weed around the general public, especially children. Do not smoke weed unless you are legally recommended or allowed to smoke recreational

- Avoid orange juice or milk, drink more water and open a window then cook/eat a hearty breakfast with eggs avoiding more potato/bread/sugar carbs. Recommend an Egg Soy Chorizo breakfast burrito, cheese if you digest cheese well. 

- If you wan't a flavored drink, try some Jamaican Ginger Beer with as much fresh ginger as possible. 

- Eat a gummy vitamin with breakfast. Eat 2 if you are a good at staying hydrated and maybe didn't eat something balanced

- Avoid cigarettes (Shouldn't be smoking those anyways. Try one of those new vapes at 7/11, way less harsh and stinky.

- Avoid any stressors/worry/negative thinking

- Avoid tablets and cell phones, avoid driving. Avoid walking too far in the sun, but do try to get some fresh air (open windows, hanging out on the porch or backyard)

- Avoid Metal, EDM, Trap, Club Jazz, any Wu-Tang song with a serious title or reference to Kung-Fu or Sun Tzu in the title and any other high energy music with pronounced Bass and Treble or heavy Lyrics. Opt for some original cut Bob Marley on low volume, some Luther VanDross, John Legend or acoustic music. Lower volume is key. To the point of not deciphering the lyrics is also key. 

- Wear sunglasses indoors. 
Avoid TV, light and people talking. Grumble.

- Avoid hokey hangover cures like ""hair of the dog"" (drinking in the morning after a hangover), bloody mary's (those are for drinking in the AM with brunch, not to cure a hangover, don't get a hangover and then you can enjoy one) chugging egg whites with tobasco and summoning Papa Legba, Haitian Voodoo diety. Shit don't work, shit makes the shit worse, yo.

- Roll a joint, smoke it with a buddy or 3 and put the thing out with 1/3 left. Blunts might give a slight headache afterwords. Recommend Joint or Bubbler operations.
 
- Eat some light (vegetarian preferred unless you are a sushi boss) sushi maybe with some avocado but definitely definitely with some **pickled ginger**, or **fresh ginger** if you know a good place. Ask for the low sodium Soy Sauce, and use it as a mix with ginger to give it more kick. **Eat all the ginger they give you**, and your friend's ginger. **Drink more water** and 2 cups green tea tops. Finish smoking that 1/3 roach you have. If more than 1 of you are following this formulae, knife-fight for the ginger and order more ginger. Don't fight if you smoked and/or are sane. Don't fight.

You don't have to do all the steps, but the more you do, the more likely you will be hangoverless. Water, rest, nutrients and easing the senses are key.

Don't smoke weed? Well smoke a tiny bit, it will do wonders. Can't/still don't smoke weed/have weed to smoke? Add more ginger and maybe take a Tylenol with the meals. 

Final Notes:

- Don't drink as much as you did. Be Responsible in all subjects. Take a Rideshare App or Taxi. Don't drive. DD up.

Water, Marijuana, Food, Coffee, and ibuprofen in roughly that order and I am completely back to 100%.
1.5 oz. of Jameson's, then water and mild exercise.

1 ibuprofen, 1 gatorade before I pass out, after I puke. Sometimes the gatorade comes back up. If that happens then tomorrow will be hell.

You forgot the part where you eat something, preferably bacon, but yeah this is the sure fire cure. Get yourself cleaned, hydrated, caffienated, fed, and masturbated. Once you've achieved all these things it will be about time to crack open some tinnies anyway.
"I always wank like crazy when I'm hung over, it gives me a 20 minute boost or something.

I can bosh out 8 on a sunday if I've been drinking the night before."
If I wanted while hungover, the rise in blood pressure would increase my headache by an order of magnitude.
I wouldn't say rubbing one out helps, but it feels damn good before the the blood rushes back to your *other* head
"Similar to my friend's Dad's cure, the triple S: shit, shower and a shave.

Edit: actually, that might have just been morning routine. I think that was it."
Isn't jerking off super bad for a hangover, since it fucks with your blood pressure even more. Every time I went for it my headache got worse. 
Recent convert.  Shit is magic.  And I'm well north of 50 so I can assure you hangovers are real at my age.  Drink 1/3 as much; suffer 3x. 
"Works miracles. The company that makes it (Abbott Labs) also owns the brand EAS, and they make this powder actually called ""Hydrate"" It's like pedialyte but athlete strength.  "
Just had a friend show me this 2 weeks ago. The stuff really works. And it always makes me take a nice nap afterwords. 
I'll knock back the pedialyte when I'm going to bed and since I'm usually restless and need to piss two or three hours before I get up in the morning, I'll knock back another with a vicodin. Once I'm up, goody's headache powder and coffee with some sort of carbs
I brush my teeth a lot when I'm hung over, it's refreshing and keeps that nasty hangover taste that makes me nauseous out of my mouth 
Pho is one of those things that always gets my mouth watering at the very mention of it. Not sure if it's the spiciness or what. Definitely trying this next time a hangover comes
Should try to avoid taking NSAIDs while there may still be alcohol being processed by your liver. The Gatorade is spot on though. In my experience, the major pains come from electrolyte imbalances from the peeing and peeing and peeing that alcohol prompts. 
Before you brush your teeth, gargle with water and baking soda. Does a WAY better job of getting the taste out than brushing does.
Don't take excedrin. Aspirin is really hard on the stomach and combined with alcohol could cause stomach bleeding and ulcers; I found this out the hard way. Ibuprofen on the other hand is the way to go 
Game Grumps playlist is uaully it for me. Take away food because the high fat helps and I cant face leaving my house. I usually dont smoke on hangover days either, so my appetite goes a bit mad.
"There's an entire budding industry ran mostly by young physicians where they will hook you up to an IV, give fluids, give oxygen, and some food and you are ""cured"" from your hangover in ~5 minutes. They will even travel to you if you pay them enough. "
I know you aren't supposed to but, I will turn on the oxygen valve on my cutting torch at work and just take some deep breaths. Helps a lot. 
Dude no bullshit pure oxygen is amazing for clearing your head. Can I get a scientist over here to explain it for me? 
I've got two big canisters of oxygen for cluster headaches, never thought about using it for hangovers.
Went to an oxygen bar in Vegas one morning (needless to say I did not feel spectacular). That was the best 20 bucks I've ever spent in my life. I felt amazing afterwards and could continue drinking immediately. 
I bought some bottled oxygen online for this purpose but it doesn't work... I think I need something that can give me more than one breath (this is meant for high altitude hiking), like a medical setup. Do you need a prescription for that?
I grew up with two boys that became physicians. They OWN a tank just for this purpose! Okay, that's just plain scary... True story. 
The paramedic version is they prevent the handover entirely by putting in IV's while they're drinking. Never get dehydrated that way. 
"Have hemophilia and flush my veins with saline after an infusion. Love being able to shoot 10cc's of saline flush and feel better within 20min 

This and a nice bowl of cannabis seems to do the trick. "
When my sister was in med school, they used to hook themselves up after a night out so they would wake up miraculously refreshed and ready for their shift. Until one person was too drunk to hang their bag properly and instead woke up a pint or two of blood down, with what I imagine was the worst hangover of their life.
The feel when the saline drip starts is fantastic. That said I'd rather not do it too often as it usually only happens after I've broken a bone.
">That's the last time I'm drinking whisky. 

This is possibly the most common lie ever spewed from the mouth of man. "
Why would they sell it in such big bottles if you aren't meant to drink the whole thing? No one drinks half a beer and puts the cap back on to save for later.
"> greasy hamburger.

At the risk of sounding absolutely disgusting... How do you do this? The thought of eating anything greasy while hungover just makes me shit myself."
To add on this, I've had great success drinking water throughout the evening as well as right before bed. I generally try to chug some water right after I piss. It's easier to at house parties and such, and if you don't give a fuck about asking for a glass of water at a bar then you're golden. My active hangover prevention has saved me countless times throughout a drinking career that has spanned almost 10 years (am 25 now). Best of luck next time. 
"I second this. Chug a ton of water and grab a bite to eat before going to sleep. If you still wake up hungover light up and drink some Gatorade. 
I also really like to eat pho the next day...that always does the trick! "
"Drink something like Aquarius or some other sports drink (no caffeine) if you can

Dehydration is the reason for hangovers but you lose much more than water alone. You piss out a shit load of elektrolites and vitamins and what not.

Sport drink have that stuff which helps, plus a vitamin pill can help especially vitamin b iirc

In the morning eat noodle soup, they actually researched it and this contains most of what you need in salts etc to cure your hangover. Plus it's easy to make"
"Actually it's only partially accurate. Alcohol is a diuretic, making you void more often than normal. When you void you loose a lot of sodium, as this is the natural way to keep a balance in your system. Otherwise our bodies would be overloaded with the amounts of salt in everything. 

Electrolytes found in Gatorade & other similar drinks help replenish this imbalance. That's also why people tend to eat greasy foods the day after and start to feel better. Lots of sodium in those types of food. "
"Pop a multivitamin or two before drinking. And try to have 1 glass of water for each drink you take. And also drink water before going to bed.

I can't remember the last time I was truly hung over."
I would always pound like 2 bottles of watee before sleeping still always feel at least some hangiver symptoms. Last couple times I started drinking a bottle of gatorade and then a bottle of water and i feel a looooot better then just water
"I drink at least a pint of water near the end of the party. Usually smoke a doob which keeps the party going but then keeps me away from the drink for the last hour or two before bed. 

And then in the morning... Pear Picking Porkys"
Weed is good, but be careful with too much water. I've been known to pee myself when drunk and drinking too much water.
I believe they are mostly due to depolarisation of your cells, alcohol removes K ions from your cell membrane which makes you hyperreactive(? I hope that is the word) to any stimulant. Also C2H5OH will turn into toxic CH3CHO during dehydrogenation in your liver. As far as i know water barely helps, try tomato juice if you need something liquid. I'm not an expert tho just few things i remember from HS classes.
"Did that once. Woke up wondering why I was wet. Got a flashback of me stumbling and pissing in my room (which was located in my parents house who didn't know I drank under age). 

Conclusion: Don't"
Also take a multi before you go to sleep along with the water. It's dehydration + a deficit in vitamins and minerals http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2039990_2039991_2040040,00.html
"The herb also improves appetite when hungover. Therefore, you can fill your body with some nutrition when blitzed that you weren't previously hungry for when feeling like alcohol endused death. Repeat these steps please.

1) wake up hungover.

2) smoke herb. ingest herb. whichever works best for you.

3) drink coconut water with a few ibuprofen.

4) the herb buzz will kick in soon, so turn on a television or get near a computer to pass the time while stoned and eating.

5) eat. preferably some eggs, fruit, bacon, plenty of coconut water or water.

6) fap.

7) shower.

8) get ready for the next hangover boys and girls!"
"Hope someone sees this cause I've always wondered. 

If I drink a shitload of water while drunk, but then hold my pee in because I don't feel like moving or getting out of bed, does the pee in the bladder still affect the hangover? You know how sometimes your urine smells like straight beer/whiskey...I've always wondered if the alcohol can still soak in while it's in the bladder, delaying feeling better. 

Sounds stupid, but I'm curious. "
And you can eat something. That helps a shit ton to have some kind of appetite. Gotta put somethin in your stomach.
"Drink loads of water that my body won't process properly and just sit in my stomach to vomit straight out in the morning? No thanks. 

My hangovers consist of one symptom: nausea. This is made way worse by drinking too much water.

The best thing for me is to make sure I've eaten plenty BEFORE drinking and then have a sensible amount of water and a hydrating drink (eg Gatorade) throughout the night."
On a side note about smoking, make sure you have reached the hangover stage.  Have woken up drunk and smoked, made everything worse.
Not *just* before you go to sleep. Drink water through the night too, or drink drinks with a lot of water in them. 
I dunno about drinking a bunch of water before going to sleep. If I do this while I'm drinking then I usually have to wake up in 3 or 4 hours to puke everything out again. If I don't chug water before I go to sleep then I'm usually fine.
I'm sure this is in the responses somewhere but thought you were talking about Juwanna Man, the movie, and was wondering how it would get you high 
"Hangovers are due to the extremely high rate at which alcohol is metabolized. Your body, on drugs, begins to compensate for the molecular invasion. Due to the rate at which alcohol is metabolized (a few hours), the body is left in overdrive and takes a little while to readjust. During this time, the overdrive is what causes the shitty feeling. In comparison, THC, the active component in marijuana, takes a few weeks to leave the body which allows the body to gradually readjust, preventing any sort of hangover feeling. Dehydration just makes a hangover last longer. 

If you want a good hangover cure, drink a bloody Mary. A small amount of alcohol will give your body in overdrive something to do besides attack itself, and the tomato and celery will provide an energy boost and water. "
"If you wake up to a hangover drinking lots of water as soon as you get up is very helpful. It's not unusual to vomit the water plus a bunch of mucous back up almost as soon as you drink it. It's like rebooting your digestive system. Then avoid all food and drink till lunchtime, and have something very basic. 

By the time that hits your stomach you'll be good as new."
You *really* should specify that this is not something you would treat like water and do *while* you're drunk. You can get the spins *bad* drinking and smoking. 
"I tend to wake up around 4-5AM after a night of drinking. I make sure I've got water right next to my bed, because I am extremely thirsty and dehydrated at that point. I usually drink around two glasses, then fall back asleep and wake up feeling fine. 

My body just sort of naturally looks out for me by waking me up before a hangover can set it, and then sleeping off any I might have in the next few hours :)"
This is the move. If you drink some before you start boozing and if you can manage to drink some before bed your next day will be a hell of a lot better 
I've got electrolyte capsules from a cycling nutrition company. Same thing, more portable, cheaper and virtually endless shelf life. Chug water and a couple of those.
"Sleep.

Wake up, curse from pain, curse from memories coming back. Try sleeping. Get up. Pee. Drink water.

Sleep.

Watch TV for few hours in bed / have a steam room and sauna sesh.

Bed.

After writing off an entire day, magically your hangover is cured. Works like 95% of the time."
Surprised to see this so far down. When you drink a lot you wash out all the electrolytes from your system, which is much the reason for the hangover. Chugging large amounts of water just furthers that. Better to drink some gatorade before sleeping, and also eat if you can.
I got really drunk Saturday night, came home and ate chicken wings. Fresh as a daisy the next day. Normally I would have been hold up in bed all day
Cherry Coke after a night full of liquor will make me throw up with out fail, then after that, I feel fine
I always used to hide in the toilets. Flat Coke though helllll no! Watermelon is the best!! A cold one.
PLUS while you're at the hospital they'll probably put you on a saline drip for your dehydration. That is the key.
"We used to always joke that Breakfast was ""chest pizza"". You wake up all ""oh gross, I fucking fell asleep with slice of pizza on my chest"" but then, fuck it its pizza right? "
"This. The last hangover I had that I wanted to kill myself, I drank about six ounces of Pedialyte and my world changed in less than five minutes. Still a bit woozy, (no deep sleep when you're drunk) but the ""please kill me"" feeling vanished almost instantly."
"Yesss! If I know I'm going out to get sloshed that night, I'll grab a big Pedialyte, throw it in the fridge and I'm good to go for the next day. I find the flavored Pedialyte a lot better than the ""unflavored."" Only thing that works for me really.... "
One time I took around 4 25mg adderall xr caps when I was drinking... I came to in the water at the beach surfing on a 50 degree windy day. Then I was hungover for three days but couldn't sleep. I'm pretty sure I took more than 4 when I was blacked out.
"For me it's not that the headache goes away, just that you aren't thinking about it / don't care. If I think, ""Do I still have a headache?"" I would answer yes, but being high hides it in a way. That's my experience anyway haha"
Yes! My job involves a lot of walking, and as much as I hate it when I'm hungover, I always recover much faster than if I just laid around the house. 
"When I do go too far and manage to get hungover, a fried breakfast is what works wonders. Bacon, eggs, and toast. 

It's funny, a breakfast like that normally makes me feel like crap for the rest of the day. Hungover? I can accomplish anything for the rest of the day. "
Gotta be a glass bottle, otherwise it just isn't proper. Gotta make sure the mushrooms are done right as well otherwise they're just disappointing.
Yeah something tells me that advil + alcohol at the same time isn't exactly the best thing for your liver.
You just killed me, damn it! I moved to Portland, OR in March and there is not a Del Taco. What the fuck am I supposed to do without Del Taco, for Christ's sake? 
Alka seltzer is where its at. If you have the packets with two tablets in them, take the first one in a pint of water before you sleep then set up a pint of water and the next tablet for first thing when you wake up. Amazeballs 
taking any painkiller during or right after drinking just gives your liver even more work, it's really, really bad for you. 
Back in the day I used to take some Ativan or Xanax and smoke some weed.  Between that and staying hydrated I felt 1000x better.
Coconut water has even been used in emergencies as an IV fluid to replenish electrolytes. It's the best source of electrolytes for the human body.
"Activated charcoal will absolutely work. The problem is that it only works when the toxin is in your stomach. It defeats the purpose of drinking if I alternate beer and charcoal. 

Edit: Still won't do it, but charcoal pills (like you said) are an option. I was thinking of the liquid suspension I'm used to giving to people that overdose on edibles."
I had a michelada at Mexican brunch once. I spat it back into the glass and threw back my mimosa to rinse the taste out. My friend who told me to try hers was kinda pissed. 
"Seriously. Even if you hate pickle juice. One shot glass worth of pickle juice has 100x more electrolytes than a whole bottle of Gatorade. Follow it with a glass or two of water and some tums and you're gucci. 
"
Exercise always does it for me. Hydrate before, and do something you enjoy doing because it's going to make you miserable for a while. I think it helps, for me at least, because if I was up late drinking, the exercise helps burn off the residual alcohol that's still giving me the dizzy feeling. If I remember, I think blood alcohol level decreases faster with a higher respiration rate, so some kind of cardio probably helps get the rest of it out of your system in a couple of hours, instead of all day. 
Actually, I had a similar experience recently. I was having a blast in Yellowstone drinking beers. The next day we are off to Jackson Hole to take the tram. We hiked up there for hours. I was pouring out that greasy hangover sweat the whole time. It was hell!! But once we calmed down and heading back I realized I felt like a million bucks. Grabbed some pizza and some beer in Grand Teton NP before going back.
why is this though? wont it just prolong the inevitable and you'll be hungover again once it wears off?
This is true. I like to drink a really easy drink like a coors light. Usually 2 of them plus a hot shower.
Along this same vein, norcos are great as well. Terrible for your liver but you'll be all floaty in no time. 
Same here, except I take ibuprofen. Tylenol can be a little rough on the liver, and that poor thing is already having a tough enough time handling the booze.
I wish I could have some cochinita tacos! Too bad I had to come in to work early, or else I'd pop across the border for some.
"""Sir Scotland is leaving the United kingdom.""


""Well then i'll have a shower, a wank and some tea.""


""But sir that won't help.""


""Did i stutter private jenkins?""


""No sir."""
I've had a lot of guys tell me this, is this a thing? I couldn't imagine anyone touching me or wanting to kiss my stale whiskey breath, let alone inside of me. 
It's made with the electrolytes and minerals that your body uses to retain and process water. I drink a glass, and then a glass of water. The company that makes it also sells individual powder packets to put in bottles of water. The stuff is great. 
"Never heard of the Pho cure.

Guess who has tomorrow off & no good excuse not to get smashed today?

Gonna get me some Pho tomorrow!"
I thought I was the only one. Showering and brushing my teeth always make me feel better than just laying around in my day old drunken filth. Being clean makes all the difference
"> Also washing your face.

Also shaving if you have patchy hair on your face like I do. I feel soooooooooo refreshed afterwards"
Regarding the Excedrin, I'm a lightweight that will get hungover after a beer or two. I definitely don't take an nsaid if there is or will be booze in my system. If I'm hungover after a heavy night of drinking it's a strick regimen of half sleep reflecting on my poor life choices.
Phở is a kind of noodle soup eaten by the Vietnamese.  It's got a ~~salty,~~ savory broth with noodles, strips of beef, and veggies.  It's always served steaming hot.

Off to rob my granny of some oxygen, BRB! "
Probably entirely [placebo](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/mobileart.asp?articlekey=21800). Your healthy lungs are very good at [maintaining oxygen levels in the blood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_gas_pressures) at standard conditions. 
Nurse here. Before work with a hangover couple of minutes of oxygen before handover starts. Works wonders 
it flat out works. i used the oxygen tank at the welding shop i worked at. it was my Monday morning miracle  
Eat some magic mushrooms dude! Apparently those headaches go away for a lot of people after eating them.
Dude you get cluster headaches and you choose to get drunk enough to get hungover, what hell do you like living in? 
As an alcoholic I want to ask someone in the medical field where i can get a tank of oxygen and how much it costs. 
I swore about 7 years ago that I'd never drink whiskey again, and I still haven't had any since then. I can't even smell the stuff without gagging ever since 'the night'.
Nah. A Fifth is 750ml, and I've nailed a bottle of Jamie's in one night multiple times and I'm still walking. Four pints is about 475 mls.
Same, everyone says to wake up and eat the greasiest thing you can find but even the thought of eating makes me want to hurl. 
I don't know. A good quarter pounder with cheese from Mc Donald's tastes great when you're hungover. At least to me.
I guess it's individual. I can't eat anything immediately after waking up with a hangover either. From 3 hours of waking up though, eating is usually fine though and that burger really helps then.
It sounded bad to me too. My mother made me try it, it works surprisingly well. I use to settle my boyfriend's stomach when he won't stop throwing up from his hangover. 
"Yes, they are.

I'm having troubles deciding what movie to watch in my hungover state. Been trying to decide for 4-5 hours... Intense."
I can't do it. I don't smoke too often, but decided to try a wake and bake on a particularly terrible hangover day... Thought I was going to die...
Why would someone give a fuck about asking for a glass of water at a bar?  I'm a bartender, and I'm always more than happy to give people water. Genuinely curious what you meant by that. 
I drink heavily three nights a week on average (college) and I make myself stop drinking, eat some food, and drink a glass of water before bed. I've found that it kills 90% of a hangover.
Whenever I go out I put a full Nalgene in my bed before I leave. As long as I drink the whole thing throughout the course of the night (which I almost always do) I'm never hungover, no matter what/how much I had to drink. 
"This is key.  1 glass of water between each drink is best.  Keeps you hydrated and spaces out your drinks so you don't get in over your head without realizing it. 

"
Don't even need food, just a ton of water, I usually try to have a glass of water for every drink I've had and then a liter or two extra before bedtime.  That generally works.
This is the over-30 answer. When they started getting worse I found I needed to do one glass of water for each drink. The only time I miss is if I'm at a crowded place ordering directly from the bar and I don't want to burden the bartender with an extra drink. Like on Friday. I'm still hungover from Friday :( 
What?  Drinking and smoking is *extremely* common and really shouldn't give you the spins.  I've actually never heard of it doing that.  I think you just have a really low tolerance.
The same things happens to me. I read into it and it supposedly it is a result of low blood sugar. A glass of milk or orange juice puts me right back to sleep.
Do they sell those at drug stores next to the normal pedialyte? Or are they in a freezer section? Can you get them at most grocery stores? THESE ARE THINGS I NEED TO KNOW!
YES! I killed a box of those after a rave last month. They seem to be a bit more hydrating than the pedialyte itself too.
Peanut butter bacon banana panini. It will change your life for the better. Salty and savory and sweet and crispy all at once.
Protein smoothies go down a bit easier. Actually, I've just done peanut butter, yogurt, and bananas which gets you some extra potassium as well and it tastes pretty great!
Hiding in the toilets with a flat coke is one thing, but hiding in the toilets with a watermelon is just weird.
It depends on how hungry you are beforehand. Usually adderall kills my hunger but if im starving before i take it, trust me ill be drawn to food
Adderall and Vyvanse typically suppress the feelings of alcohol, so you end up drinking way fucking more than you realize. 
Concerta is technically not the same as adderall  in chemical composition so you won't have the same effect
 I sit/lay in the bottom of the shower(as hot as I can stand) for about 45 minutes with a couple bottles of water and my iPad.usually dry heave a few times. Or spew up cold water, which some how relives the pressure on my brain or something and makes me feel much better for about 10 minutes at a time. Will usually end up tugging one out just because I'm all wet and I've got the iPad. About 5 minutes before I get out I turn the water to cool. While I'm in there I usually order pho from grub hub. Then go lay in my blacked out 70 degree room naked till my pho arrives. I take down as much pho as I can handle then pass out. Sometimes rinse repeat depending how Jeffried I got.  Either that or a double jägerbomb and hitch a ride to the beach and call off work the next day.
I usually force myself to go lift, or at least run. You usually feel significantly worse for about 45 minutes to an hour after, then you feel completely normal. 
Well when u drink alcohol u are delepting ur body from vitamin b.. So really anything b1, b6, or b12 related.. But i try to take a higher dose of thiamine (b1).. I also try to take some vitamin c, magnesium, or manganese. But real key is to get hydrated (Pedialyte) Hope that helps. 
Maybe if they didn't have like 15 employees doing the same job my local diner does with 7 or 8 they wouldn't have to raise prices
As drunk as I've ever gotten I've never lost bowel control.  I've gotten shit faced to the point of falling down. I just think that it depends on the person really. 
"You're thinking Tylenol (acetaminophen/paracetamol).  Advil (ibuprofen) is excreted by the kidneys, not the liver.  Same with Aspirin (ASA).  Advil, Aspirin and alcohol are all bad for the gastrointestinal tract.  Patients taking either pain killer long term risk developing gastrointestinal bleeding, and this is more likely if they also regularly consume alcohol.  That doesn't necessarily prove that this is an interaction though (meaning it could be that it's not caused by taking both at once, just by taking both regularly).  Still, mixing the two should probably be avoided, especially if getting hangover-level drunk is a regular event in your life.

Advil wears off in 4 hours anyway.  Taking it before bed won't help anything.  Just take it in the morning.  (Don't take Tylenol in the morning, you can still damage your liver doing that)."
I've seen the aloe water ones but drinking aloe sounds gross. I know coconut water helps with your electrolytes what's aloe got going for it?
"Strangely enough no, That other guy is talking out his ass. I didnt say slam 5-6 shots, but one drink will cure the most nasty of hangovers and no, you will NOT feel exponentially worse, you will feel magnitudes better.
The drink that did it for me are called 'Red eyes"". 50% beer. 50% Clamato juice. Tabasco or pepper to taste. Trust me. I will say though it is a slippery slope to alcoholism."
"I know it sounds like shitty advice, but hands down I fucking swear by it. I'd say if you're feeling still drunk or like you're going to vomit if you get out of bed, you're probably safer not exercising, but something about sweating out the poison just helps.

Maybe you have a different experience, or maybe you're just going off of how terrible it sounds, but I'm telling you it works for me and others I know."
"It's been 5 years since I had a girlfriend, but back then we'd pour a quick morning drink and get it on.

Vietnamese noodle dish with a lot of broth, tons of flavor, good to rehydrate and you can spice it up to sweat out some hangover badness
It's not salty at all? I think a good pho has to have a balanced taste, if it's salty then something's wrong. I'm Viet.
No, that isn't condescending. I know better than that, and shite grammar and spelling bothres me; two.
If I had a hangover so bad that I considered spending $259 to get rid of it I'd probably just blow my brains out.
That's awesome! But where could a business be located where they can stay profitable? Oh, of course. They're in Vegas. All of a sudden, the prices don't seem bad. Why waste the rest of a vacation with a hangover!
Yeah, your oxygen saturation is usually almost 100% in a relatively healthy person, right? It's not like pure O2 can get you to 110% or something. 
Is that safe? Like theres no bullshit mixed with the oxygen? If so I'm gonna do this at work tomorrow
Yeah I picked two big bag fulls about a month ago when they were all growing near my house. Probably enough to last the rest of the year. I'm not a big fan of hallucinogens, but they have calmed the clusters down. They haven't gone away as such, but do not occur as frequently.

My cluster headaches usually happen at the same time each year, around the autumn equinox, so I have a vague window where I make sure i do not drink at all. Since getting cluster headaches I hardly have hangovers at all to be honest. I think my brain has had enough pain already, so a hangover is nothing. From time to time I will still get a bit of a hangover though. 
See if you've got a Korean spa in your area.  The one here has an oxygen room.  Tack that on to a nice hot tub and steam sauna, coupled with bottle after bottle of water, a quick nap, and you're in much, much better shape for $30.

Wait til the mid-40s. I was a super boozer and user, and then the crippling hangovers started. Never had a problem, then suddenly...BOOM...3 days in bed. Sober over 2 years now, worth it.
"Depends when you started drinking actually, I'm 20 and get the worst hangovers ever (couch potato for 2 days).

Until I was 18/19 I could drink all night and be perfect the next day."
Probably some dumb bull shit like seen as weak by your friends by not having a beer the entire time out. Or feeling like bartenders work for tips and you are pestering them without tipping etc...
I've had more than one bartender or waitress make a joke when I ask for water then just not bring it to me.
"Some people might have jerk off ""friends"" who would chirp them for getting water at a bar, I've seen it before unfortunately. "
Part of dehydration is electrolytes, and drinking a shitload of water dilutes them. If you're drinking beer, drinking water between drinks will get you extremely hungover. Aside from the replacement thing. Drinking less will always get you less hungover.
"No, I don't have a low tolerance, and I didn't say you *will* get the spins. I'm saying you *can*. So all the downvoters can fuck off with their ""downvote as disagree"" BS. "

The general effect and the way it works on your brain is the same as amphetamine salts (adderall) both cause a release of dopamine which is what makes the hangover go away. You just have to watch your fluids because stimulants will dehydrate you.
I've had both and found either to be useful for hangovers. Both are stimulants. My addy is IR, however, so it's a faster kick for sure than ER Concerta. The biggest difference is that concerta doesn't prolong the serotonin reuptake like adderall does, so you don't get as much of the happy high that helps kill the hangover. 
They're completely different. Btw how did you know I take Concerta instead of Ritalin? They're both MDT.
Nah concerta does actually sober you up somewhat. I've seen a blackout drunk friend pop a 54mg concerta and he looked sober in an hour. 
"Was at a concert on Friday night, woke up with what I can only imagine being the best drunkness planning I've ever done - bottle of irn bru sat in the corner of my bed room but went down for excessive amounts of bacon, eggs fried bread and mushrooms - and the mushrooms had been sat for a while. :(

Oh yeah definitely sweating out. Maybe sitting in the sauna or something. But working out after drinking or having alcohol in your system. It can lead to lactic acidosis and it's dangerous. But sweating out, I definitely agree, just not from exercising. 
Oh you silly chap how can you not know Sir Scotland? I'd tut you dearly if I didn't have to finish up this wank before tea. 
Yeah, but Gatorade is full of sugar. It will help hydrate you, but the simple carbohydrates like sugar will make the hangover worse. Gatorade is only really good when you're working out enough to burn it off. I wouldn't recommend for a hangover. 
Rehydrate? I've only had Pho once, but they put so much salt in it i felt like i was dying of dehydration for the rest of the evening. Must have been a shit restaurant.
Hehe, it's a quote from a sketch incredibly famous in Germany. It's called 'Dinner for one'. Check it out, we watch it every New Years Eve.
I'm half Viet.  Pho definitely isn't salty as in you can taste the salt, but you know there's salt in it.  I'll clarify the post.  
I'd do it for a Vegas trip or something.  Get smashed then have them come at an appointed time and hook you up.
"Oxygen saturation refers to the amount of oxygen that is bound to hemoglobin in blood as a percentage. There's also an amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood plasma which is called PaO2 (Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood). That number does increase as you breath higher proportions of oxygen even if your O2 sat is 100%. As far as the mechanisms that would explain why oxygen is helpful for headaches, I suspect we don't have know the answer. That said, it's a well established treatment (with randomized trials) for the treatment of cluster headaches. For example: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=185035&resultclick=24

Most of the studies are low power, but largely show that that O2 inhalation therapy for the treatment of cluster headache is helpful. 

Here's a study that hints at a mechanism:

I don't know of any studies specifically on the treatment of hangover headaches, but perhaps it has a similar mechanism... or it could just be a placebo effect."
"Whew.. alright. So.. A little back story.

There was a girl that I met between 9th and 10th grade. We'll all her 'C'. I knew she was the one from the moment I saw her. We were both at a friend's house. She was in the basement where a LAN party was in full pitch. I came down the stairs and we immediately locked eyes for what seemed like forever, both eventually squeaked out a ""hey"", and went on with the festivities, stealing a sheepish glance and grin here and there.

So.. We ended up dating for nearly a year before we went our separate ways. We both had a lot of growing up to do, and needed some time to really realize what we wanted.


Fast forward to 'the night'. I'm sitting at home, drinking 101 proof whiskey with my cousin 'M'. Now mind you,  and I as it turns out never stopped thinking about the other, so as usual, she's occupying my mind like a spoiled college kid on wall street. I start speeding up the shots, eyeing my phone, trying to work up the courage to all her.


At this point, I'm *drunk*. Like, sailor on leave drunk. With a belly full of liquid courage I squint one eye and dial her number. I hoped it was still the same as it used to be. It was.

""Hello?"" Oh god, that voice. It's her. ""H-hey, it's anon..""

We ended up talking for about an hour. Catching up ect, all the while I'm powering through shots and chain smoking because I'm an absolute nervous wreck. You know that shot that you pour where your body is like ""nope. that's the one that's gonna do us in..""? Well.. I poured that shot and took it against my better judgement. Immediately, the room was about 200 degrees and my stomach was doing a barbaric tribal dance, spears included.


I manage to get out a ""AHGAD CAWYU BACH"", hang up, and start making my way to the bathroom, which was on the first floor (M and I were upstairs).

Wooden stairs, socks, and alcohol do not mix. My foot hits the first stair and I immediately start sliding, somehow managing to stay upright. I make it to the landing half way down the stairs and slam into the wall, rattling the pictures hanging along the stairs. I start for the seond set of stairs and immediately begin sliding again, but when i reach the bottom, I spin 180 and fall backwards into an old antique rocking chair, slamming that into the wall behind it. I recover quickly and charge to the bathroom, beginning to puke as I opened the bathroom door. I must have been a vomit bender in a past life because somehow, it all made it into the toilet.


So for the next couple of hours I'm throwing up what surely was alcoholic napalm, clinging desperately to the toilet to prevent falling onto the bathroom ceiling. M came down to check on me after all the commotion of gravity harassing me. At some point I made it back to my bedroom upstairs and slept until about 3pm the next day. 


Dat hangover doe. M had brought me a bucket and a big glass of water some time during the night, which were both godsends the next day.


Anyway, about a month later, C and I got back together and have been together ever since. I'm still never drinking whiskey again though.

It's because sports drinks have sodium in them... They're meant to rehydrate and replenish the sodium lost in sweat. If you're not sweating, your Na levels get too high which causes you to pee more... More pee = less hydration == hangover fuel.

"Still laughing..... He said, ""I feel like my body just turned off the internal 'hangover recovery center'. Everyone quit their jobs.......""  Dying over here. Too funny!"
Happened at 28 as well, hangovers are a 2-3 day thing. I need to psyche myself up to drink heavily, if I don't, I wind up with a hangover in the middle of the evening if I drink at a reasonable pace; drinking is now a chore.
"You realize that you're getting old and all your shit doesn't work anymore.

Seriously though, 30 is about the time that most people discover that they need longer to recover from everything. Workout soreness, getting sick, hangovers, etc."
I hate to be the one to tell you this but its going to be tremendously worse when you've been drinking for 20+ years. If you're laid up for two days now, well... you may not be much of a drinker when you're 30. 
I always ask for a beer, a shot, and a water. You give me that, and I won't bug you for at least a half hour. 
"Damn, people are fucking stupid if they percieve drinking water to avoid a hangover as ""unmanly"".  Who wants to feel like shit in the morning?"
I'm 49 and that shit works for me fine, and I drink at a seriously competitive level. A 750 of Jameson's a night isn't unheard of.
I'm in college and those methods don't work for me. At age 19, I have hangovers that last a day and a half. Quit drinking a month ago because it just wasn't worth it.
Don't know why you are being downvoted. It is absolutely the case. I am a seasoned alcoholic, and routinely down 12 beers in a sitting. If I were to drink 12 pints of water as well, I could very well be dead before morning. 
I've actually never heard anyone say it even can.  You're getting down voted because you're wrong, not because people disagree.  It was probably just a coincidence that you got the spins after you smoked.
OJ is actually way better than sports drinks. A glass has more potassium than a banana (~450mg), whereas most sports drinks have less than 100mg.
They both contain methylphenidate as the active ingredient but concerta is long acting, whereas Ritalin is short acting. 
As someone who used to be addicted to Stims I can assure you their effects aren't the same. Theoretically they should be but Concerta feels altogether different. Sort of how different weed strains technically do the same thing chemically but some are vastly different feeling. 
not exactly.  Adderall is both a dopamine receptor agonist and reuptake inhibitor, whereas methylphenidate is only a dopamine receptor reuptake inhibitor
And a hangover is just being dehydrated through alcohol replacing water bonds in your bloodstream, probably don't do this.
Isn't Concerta just the time-release formulation? It's a fair guess that somebody with ADD would rather take time-release than try to remember multiple pills throughout the day...
"I've been medicated on a lot of ADD and depression medication so I end up knowing which is which. 

Edit: apparently explaining how I know which medication is which calls for downvotes... Okay. "
That's wonderful except for the fact that you didn't even read my comment. My comment said concerta and adderall are two different medications with two different active ingredients and you went on to tell me I was wrong and as proof, your buddy took concerta to sober up. Good for him?
not he mix, actually is lemon, pepper, celery salt, Worcestershire, dash of soy sauce, clamato (not just clam juice) tabasco, poured over ice and yes, topped with beer, you add some dried shrimp to it and it's heaven thru a straw.
Works for me, but I didn't know it could be detrimental. Then again I've only worked out with slight hangovers (which I get more easily as I get older).
"Some pho is like that, but good pho isn't.

But even then, when you're hungover and dehydrated all that salt would probably help."
You need the salt to cure the hangover, you literally just pissed away all the salt in your body the night before, the fat also helps with the uptake of salts. Pho is literally second to none in this
That's not the case, I think his point was if that was how bad the hangover was that it was worth so much money to get rid of then his first instinct would just be to kill himself

And even if the company doesn't do regular random screenings they reserve the right to test you at any time making it detrimental to your entire career to risk smoking the mary jane.

Even most part time minimum wage jobs do the pre-employment screening although they don't test you again once employed."
My hangover is cured with food and water even if I have to force it. I haven't thrown up in a looong time. 
I also was addicted to stims and the feeling was never really that different for me to be honest. Perhaps it's possible for some people not to notice? Just like some people can't tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi...
Ritalin has an extended release formula too, Concerta has a few more differences according to my doctor, although I don't know what they are.
Yeah but if it can take someone from blacking out to sober, I'd say it's safe to assume it'd fix a hangover as well
"Wtf are you talking about? He said adderall sobers him up, OP has concerta or ritalin, you said concerta and addy aren't the same thing.

I'm sorry pal but that still sounds absolutely horrible to me. I respect your right to like it though.
I really wouldn't believe it if i hadn't experienced it. I've always been good at holding back the floodgates and can proudly say I've never puked anywhere but a toilet or trash can. It was some cartoon level shit, but I managed to avoid breaking anything. I put a nice dent in the wall behind the rocking chair though.
"You know, I was always horrified of the day that I'd be old and have to start getting the occasional colonoscopy.

It ended up that I had to get one last year, and it really wasn't that bad. Wasn't that great either though."
That's what gets me now. I could deal with nausea or vomiting or headaches, but now hangovers leave me anxious in addition to that and it's just awful. Not worth it.

Valium or another benzo is the actual best hangover cure, just don't get too attached to them. Or eat them while you're drunk.

"I believe it is fairly common. Some whatnotery about alcohol dilating your arteries causes your heart to pump faster as does dehydration. Sugar levels all messed up next day, stuff like that.

I used to sleep off hangovers, pass that hangover shit, eat something greasy and either chill that night or maybe drink all over again. Can't really do that anymore when you get older.

Binge drinking is fun and all, but your body needs time to recuperate. "
"I would count my heart beats in bed, and right when I would fall asleep, I'd wake up immediately because I didn't feel my heart beat and was afraid it just stopped completely for no reason. Now I'm less paranoid, but my drinking went from ~30-40 beers in a week to maybe a 6 pack in a month.

Anxiety sucks."
"From what I've researched (and quite possibly poorly, at that) alcohol widens your arteries which causes your heart to pump faster. Couple that with alcohol turning into sugar and when you come off/wake up the next morning, your sugar levels are out of whack. Dehydration also causes your heart to race, and I would chain vape while drinking (which further dehydrates you) until I passed out. Sometimes I would drink water before bed, sometimes not. 

Do you wake up a few hours after a night of drinking? That also had to do with your body burning away sugar and then having a huge amount of energy and nothing to do with it.

I posted this concern to an ask doctors subreddit, and all I got was a ""doctor, it hurts if I do this. Well, don't do it"" type of response. "

"yeah, that's pretty much all I know about it too. I actually used to assume Ritalin was also extended release, but only recently found out it had to be taken throughout the day (normally)
That soudns like a nightmare."
I disagree. The reason I think marijuana is the best hangover cure is simple: not only is it effective, it's nearly instant in effects. I can feel relief within a minute, and full effects within 10-15. When you have a really bad hangover, you don't want to wait for a pill to kick in. Not to mention, if I wake up nauseous and ready to throw up, the last thing I want to do is swallow pills and water.
"Did you insult them and up vote them?  

Seriously though.  I rarely drink to get drunk anymore but a few craft brews or even one or two too many give me crippling anxiety the next day.  I hardly ever wake up after laying down and initially falling asleep.  It's when I first wake up all the way til I've showered eaten and possibly had another beer or two.  My mother has social anxiety and gifts me a zanax here and there when it's really bad but that's literally the only thing that helps me other than drinking more.  And sometimes that just makes it worse.  I've talked to my doctor about it multiple times.  ""Quit drinking, quit smoking weed and start excercising more.""  Is what I always get.  I'm pretty fit from my job but I still lift weights on the weekends.  I rarely drink more than 4-12oz cans of beer and I only smoke weed on the weekends (long after my kids have gone to bed).  I've also done some research on this and have come to the same conclusion.  But why now?  I used to drink a 5th of whiskey, smoke an 8th, along with a full pack of cigarettes and then wake up the next day and go to work IN A GREAT MOOD.  Fully aware of and almost ENJOYING my hangover.  Hell I used to call in sick and drive 2 hours to go surfing because the feeling of catching a wave while I was hungover was incredible to me.  Now I'm scared to get out of bed sometimes because the rush of standing up makes me feel like I might fall down dead or have a heart attack. "
Yeah, it wasn't fun. Having ADD isn't exactly conducive to maintaining a rigid medication schedule, and missing a dose, even by an hour or so just totally throws your day for a loop.
"Of the pill itself, they're built differently than Ritalin XR. Concerta doesn't release as much MDT in the morning as other pills.Are you saying two drugs made by entirely different companies are identical?"
The drug goes beyond the substance, it is dependent on administration. Are you a pharmacist or psychiatrist?
"Different methods of administration mean different effects.

Is your username only a hobby or part of your job? Why did you call my doctor a dirty liar?"
"Different methods of administration do not mean different effects, they mean different intensity and duration of effects.

It is a hobby, but you phrased your other comment as if your doctor said methylphenidate was a different drug from methylphenidate."
