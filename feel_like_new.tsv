textGotta be drowning or almost drowning.  Gordon Lightfoot wasn't kidding when he said the waves turn the minutes to hours.  Two incidents still stick in my head decades after they happened, once at swimming lessons before i could tread water and the instructor wasn't paying attention to me and i started going under.  It was probably only 30 seconds but i thought that was it.  Another time having a Canoe overturn in lake Erie and trying to get it righted.  That time I even had a life jacket but the fact the waves kept throwing water over my face really made me think i was done for.

"My five year old son has a pet turtle. He absolutely lives for that turtle, everything in his life revolves around that turtle. Over the last week his turtle had been moving slower and slower, and avoiding food. At 1am I took the turtle to the vet and the vet said Sandy the turtle had a bowel obstruction that couldn‚Äôt be fixed. He gave Sandy some saline injections straight into the digestive system to soften things up, but this morning Sandy had passed away. I had to sit Wesley down and tell my beautiful son that the turtle he cares for more than anything in the world had passed away. The first thirty seconds of breaking his poor little heart felt like it dragged on for hours. Seeing the happiest kid in the world come to the realisation that Sandy the turtle was dead, the image of the happiness in his big eyes draining out to the saddest expression I‚Äôve ever seen, it was haunting. 

I know it was only a turtle, and I know there will be times in my son‚Äôs lives that they will suffer true heartbreak and loss of loved ones, but that first thirty seconds of his sadness will stay with me forever."

I keep scrolling to find contraction, it must be here somewhere.  When you are in labor contractions come every couple of minutes and last 30 sec to a minute.  It‚Äôs not pain, at least for me, it felt more like I was being crushed to death and couldn‚Äôt breathe.

I had LASIK done about 4 years ago. During the procedure, once they cut the flap and actually were reshaping my cornea, that was the longest 20-30 seconds of my life. They put so much pressure on my eye that I couldn‚Äôt see, and they told me to look straight ahead and not move my eyes. I had no visual reference, so I just tried not to move my eyes. They actually stopped at least once and reminded me not to move, so I was afraid that they zapped off something I would actually need to see. Everything turned out ok though.

"I was 15yo during the time. I had a doctors appointment and went to the lab for blood work, thinking it'd be easy, done and over-with. After all, it wasn't my first time having blood taken.

They took like 7 vials of blood from me. I don't know why, but I got extreamely squeamish from the smell of them sanitizing my arm and from the needle pricking me. I had like this weird sensation from my nose, but I remained calm. Suddenly, I started to feel cold and very clammy and I could feel the blood draining from my face, like it was going pale. Then my vision was tunneled, and my hearing was slowly diminishing. I began to complain that I wasn't feeling good. The nurse was rushing to switch vials and told me that she was halfway done. I was trying to relax the best I can and just breathe, but it really wasn't helping. By the time she got to the last vial, my face was numb, my back was sweaty, my vision was completely blacked out and everything sounded muffled like I was under water. The nurse had asked me something and I weakly said ""I can't even understand you."" If I remembered correctly, I think they had to call code white (or blue, not sure which one) just to be sure I was okay. Because there was a lot of shuffling going on near me, and I think there were other staff personell coming in to check on me. They also called for my dad in from the waiting room, and he sat with me until I was okay to get up.

I didn't actually faint but it felt kinda scary to be conscious through all of that. I know I wasn't actually bleeding to death but I'm pretty sure that's what it feels like to slowly die from blood loss. And although it didn't hurt, it didn't feel very comfortable either.

Someone on here also mentioned an IUD insertion, and yes, that is also very painful and it felt like forever when doctor did it, no matter how fast they tried to finish it."
"I read comments saying drowning is longest 30 seconds. I dont know cause I dont go in water. I cant swim. It reminds me of a man named Calvin that I used to work with traveling on the railroad doing rail maintenance who was in Vietnam war. Our crew was at a hotel and there was a pool and saw Cal in hallway and asked if he was hittin the pool. He said ""I dont go in water"" with a firm voice and I said ""ha, that's funny. I cant swim and I say that too when anyone asks."" All the sudden I realized Calvin had changed. His facial expression was very serious and he had a visual body language telling me I had done something to upset him. I should give you a description of Cal and I will tell you he is an absolute bear. About 6'4 but a brute of a muscular and solid structured man. A bear is the best thing I can liken him to and when he was a younger guy I am sure he could do some incredible damage with his hands but make no mistake he had the hair on the back of my neck standing up now and he said ""funny, ain't nothing funny about it."" I didnt know why it was so serious but then he told me what happened to him to make him not go in water. He said he was in Vietnam and his platoon had just filled their canteens at a small river and were taking a rest in a spot close to there. Calvin had drank most of his water and had gone back to the water to fill it again before getting back to walkin with the platoon. He said he had filled it and was splashing water on his face when he was hit from behind and was held under water by a ""bunch of g**ks"" and was within a second of passing out and drowning when his buddy had come to check on him and shot four of them. Intently listening and very interested in his experience I  said ""he saved your life right there, damn good thing he came to check on you"" when Calvin had changed again. He went from very serious to looking satisfied, almost childishly happy and what he said next has expanded the darker side of my imagination many times over the years since and I am glad he didnt tell me about it and I didnt ask. He said ""yeah, my friend shot four of them but bless his heart he saved one of them for me."" Right then I knew why he looked like he was being tickled. He said ""I will never forget him for that. Nicest thing ANYONE has EVER done for me. I was feeling the hair on back of my neck standing up again right then and said ""Cal that's amazing and I'm glad you made it and for what it's worth thank you for your service but I gotta get a shower and its gettin late"". That was the end of that conversation but I am sure the four that were shot by Cals friend were very much the lucky ones. I got the feeling that guy left for Calvin had a very horrific experience that day."
When you‚Äôre just about to crap yourself and there‚Äôs someone in the toilet and every time you knock they say ‚Äòjust a minute‚Äô and you get so desperate that you begin to shake and then you can feel it escaping your butthole and you shove your hand up your butt to keep it in there but it‚Äôs just squeezing past and then the door opens and you run poo flying everywhere as you sit on the toilet only to find... the... lid is closed.

"The thirty seconds it takes for me to realize I can't hold my pee anymore, and go running all the way down stairs to the bathroom ~20 seconds, absolute hardest is when your to the bathroom and trying to pull all ur clothes down so you can go (woman) ~another 10 seconds of franticness.

the last 30 seconds of extra time in a football match when your team's winning by a goal and the opponents have the ball. it feels like literal hours
"Waiting to clock in. Actually, it's the 60 seconds before time to clock in, but even 30 seconds feels so long. 

Our system has a three-minute window, allowing one to clock in as early as three minutes before the shift starts. So that last minute or 30 seconds feels like an hour."

"The last 30 seconds of a laser tattoo removal treatment. I've had six treatments, so far to remove a large tattoo on my left hand, my knuckles and my neck. It's brutal. And before the question of ""why?"" comes up...at the time I collected these tattoos, I was more or less making a living as a traveling musician. After two years in a serious relationship, my girlfriend (who is now my wife) came up pregnant. In order to secure a more stable and professional career, I began removing all of my visible tattoos. I have zero regrets about my decision, and I couldn't be happier with the family we have created."
The 30 seconds (probably less than that) it takes to crash your car. I was hit by a hit and run a few years ago that sent my car spinning across the highway and crashed me head on into the cement divider. I was alone in the car and everything literally felt slow motion.
The 30 seconds your staring at the microwave because there is no point in doing anything else in 30 seconds.
From personal experience? The 30 seconds between something happening and seeing the eminent pain coming right for you.
Laser eye surgery. It was probably only a few minutes in total, but each eye felt like quite a long time. At least longer than what really was going on. Definitely a weird experience getting lasered in the eye while its held open with forceps things and this big ass suction cup laser thing.
Watching B-52 Alert klaxon out and roll to the hammerhead, turn and go balls to the firewall.  No sweat until they run 'em up and start to roll.  Might not be the full 30 seconds, but nothing gets your stomach to stop like watching the end of the world thundering down the runway.

He inhaled, held it. 30 seconds later, exhaled dramatically. Didn't disturb him at all.

Being woken up in the middle of the night with a cramp suddenly turning your whole calf into one dense ball of unscheduled pain.
I was at work, I work with intellectually disabled adults, and I was with an individual who was having a behavior. This individual is one of the greatest and kindest you‚Äôll meet and I love them, but very large, and get physically violent when they are triggered. It probably lasted about 3 minutes, but every second they were hitting me felt like the longest second.
"Dental work. That piercing sound of the drill seems to go on forever as you white knuckle the chair. You count the ceiling tiles for the 20th time and sing the ABCs in your head to stay distracted. You open your eyes for a moment to see what's happening and see the concentrated faces of the dentist and assistant, and think that if you accidentally move your face just a little, or try to swallow at the wrong time, that drill will carve right through your cheeks. And then the dentist backs away, the drill stops, your chair is moved to the upright position, you're told ""we're all done!"" and you grab your phone. Then you look at the clock and realize it's only been 3 minutes."
When you hear a life-changing diagnosis. The terror and panic mixes with the longing for an answer, for a treatment for whatever you're experiencing. It never gets easier.
When my parents told me they left something at home and ask me to wait of them for 30seconds, it has been 25 years.
The trip from the car to the kitchen with armfuls of groceries because I‚Äôm damn sure not going to make another trip. Also turning into the driveway and making it to the toilet before you explode.
"one time i almost got caught shoplifted. i was in high school and one of my classmates tried to shoplift over the weekend and got away with it. told her i could do better. tried it and as i was walking out one of the guards asked if they could do a random inspection. i said sure, he saw the item i stole and asked why i had two pcs of it in my bag and just said ""i just have those in my bag the whole time, you can ask the guard in the entrance she saw those when she checked my bag"". he told me to wait, asked the guard in the entrance to validate my claim, and after the entrance guard affirmed, they let me go. the whole thing with the security wasnt really 30 seconds but it was relatively short but felt like forever. i was so nervous that my lips went pale and promised myself i would never do it again lol"
Before your favorite song gets going. The flower song from Lakme often has thirty seconds of chatter before it actually starts, and the inconsistency of classical pieces in general is a big turnoff to me.
"When you start a ‚Äúcouch to 5k‚Äù app running program and you‚Äôre in the last 30 seconds before you can walk again because you‚Äôre super out of shape. 

Also, for the plankers - I thought you were only supposed to hold planks for no more than 30 secs because if you go longer you‚Äôre probably doing it wrong. I‚Äôm not an expert but that‚Äôs what my physical therapist told me when she added planking to my nightly exercises."
Last 30 seconds of microwaving food at 2 AM. Like come on!! Surely 15 seconds will be warm enough right? NO
"Going on a first date/contact from an online match, after you get their ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù text. 

That 30 seconds of looking at everyone walking through the door or walking close to the table before you spot them, praying to the gods that they actually look like their picture is pretty intense for me."
Clicking submit on a test that you‚Äôve been studying hard for.  The test is suppose to give you ‚Äúinstant results‚Äù.

When the driver taking me home from a bar says we were less than a minute away and I really had to puke.
Don't know if this counts, but when you have a few minutes to sleep, the whole dream feels like 20 minutes.
"One time I was high on acid and was watching a stop watch timer and the seconds were speeding up and slowing down, and my gf at the time who also was on acid was experiencing the same thing, it was pretty trippy!

Time on psychedelics is almost meaningless anyways."
When you've already cum, but she's ALMOST there, so you keep going even though your dick is SUPER sensitive to the point where it almost hurts, and it's already going soft but goddammit you're not gonna let her down!
I had to get several injections into my lumbar and also at the base of my neck. I had to lay on my stomach while a very long needle was inserted. I could feel the needle going into what felt like an area deep at the base of my back. That one wasn't so bad. The base of my neck felt very very strange though. So that was something that felt like it took too long but was only several seconds.
"Any 30 second stretch during a hold-down while surfing - that shit goes on forever and never stops scaring the hell out of me

When a jury reaches a verdict, and you wait for the foreman to announce it.  Never been a party in a jury trial, but I‚Äôve tried a number of cases as former prosecutor.  It‚Äôs extremely intense for the attorneys, but I can only imagine what it feels like for someone facing prison.
"I remember my first kiss with the woman who is now my wife.

We went out to catchup on the Wednesday as we went to uni together and were friends, and she had just moved to my town.

When I saw her I was blown away, I always had a crush on her but I was breathless. Anyway, I may have accidently blurted out ""Wow, you are as beautiful as I remembered""

Anyway, I asked her to dinner the next day and we had an amazing evening out, eating and drinking, then I walked her home and on her doorstep we hugged and she said:

""was this a date? Because it was a really good one""

Then we kissed and honestly, that 30 second kiss felt like a lifetime.

It was the best thing that had happened to me until that moment and even though I lived a 2 hour walk away and could have easily taken the bus straight to my home, I had too much adrenaline so I walked all the way. I skipped most of it actually.

Well that was 10 years ago anyway, and I still remember it like it just happened."

And the next few days after that, every piss I had to take."
the covid test i was given involved a nurse shoving a giant q-tip down both nostrils (one at a time) to the very end of my sinus cavity. She had to leave it there for 10 seconds each, so not 30 seconds, but it still felt like an eternity.

When you no longer feel your foot from 4,000 lbs rolling up and down it. I've never felt fear like that and haven't since, thankfully. Knowing you have body part crushed, can see it and, able to use it without having any sense has got to be the longest 30 seconds I have endured before any sensation returned.
Getting tattoo linework done on a particularly painful spot. When it's done you realize you were holding your breath and clenching your jaw the whole time.

"When I'm at the end of my shift and I see my manager get out of her car on the security cameras.

That next thirty seconds, as she walks to the door, my anxiety about everything I might have screwed up, or should be doing, or maybe forgot just comes up from behind and hits me like a fucking waterboarding session."
You've been our driving and need to go to the bathroom. Those seconds between getting out of the car and to the bathroom are the longest most agonizing seconds, especially if you have to take an elevator to get to your condo.
when youre about to scare someone and its completely silent. you are in an uncomfortable position and you know you have to be completely still or theyll hear you. youre almost in a trance as you wait to unleash an AHHHH as abruptly as possible from the dead stillness. As you prepare, you know you could be here for minutes. 'is it worth it?' crosses your mind but at this point youre in too deep. on the other hand, nobody will know how foolish you are if you fail to get a scare. no, you must endure, how long has it been? idk, it has to have been 2 minutes by now.. but you know deep down its only been about.. 30 seconds.. ..

the Covid-19 test.  Believe me, it is not a fun experience, they tell you it will take 30 seconds but it feels like an hour before they pull that shit out of your nose
Right at the peak of a caffeine high. I very rarely have caffeine due to its effect on me. Even 1/4 of a tea spoon is enough slow down my perception of time. (Aka everything becomes slightly slow motion). And keep me up for up to 24 hours. So at its peak 30 seconds can feel upwards of a minute.
"When my husband and I first met, I asked him out on a date over the phone. I had never asked anyone out before + I hate talking on the phone + the general riskiness of putting myself out there made for the 5 second silence to feel forever.

"The police call you and tell you there's an officer on his way to speak to you. They explain you're not in any kind of trouble, but they can't discuss anything over the phone. You wait where you can see their car when they arrive. They step out of the car, and you wait while you see them putting on their hats. You can tell by they mannerisms, this is a formal moment. They're professional, they're not smiling. They're showing no emotion all. They confirm your identity, and they remove their hats.

They regret to inform you that your entire world is upside down. Everything is ruined. Their words are poison, and you'll spend the rest of your day sharing that poison with the people you love the most."

When you‚Äôre done with your presentation and the teacher asks if anyone has questions. The 30 seconds before you know that he‚Äôll ask a question that will destroy you are pretty scary tbh.

I did a lot of sports. Cross Country, Wrestling, Track and Field, ect. I'd say the longest moment is that split second before the starting whistle or gun goes off. The moment when everyone is in position ready and you all connect. You can hear your breathing and the sound of your heartbeat floods your head, then you hear the bang and for a faint second everything goes quite before you hear the cheers and your off. Then all you hear is your feet on the tarmak and your breathing. Gets me everytime.
Waiting for your food in the microwave after you put it back a second time since its was semi warm/cold.

I work in television, master control operator. Whenever programming doesn't air as expected, seconds seem to slow down. A missing commercial spot, black padding that should've been trimmed from a show segment, playlist systems crashing or failing... too many things to list.

Not sure about 30 seconds but I guess if you count the 25 seconds leading up to adenosine administration that would probably be the longest feeling.  Adenosine is given in the setting of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias (Atrial Fibrillation, commonly) to produce a brief asystole to let your heart rhythm kind of reset.  It stops your heart for 5-10 seconds, and those are some of the longest seconds you‚Äôll ever experience.  It feels like you‚Äôre dying, an intense sensation of doom and chest pressure, and it‚Äôs all happening with several concerned looking healthcare providers crowded around your hospital bed and outside the room.

It probably didn‚Äôt even last 30 seconds, but it felt so much longer.

About 1:15 he miraculously gets up and walks to the kitchen and collapses (in my arms luckily). The next hour was fucking brutal as he struggled to breathe and cried out a few times. I kept checking the clock hoping it would be 3:15 but I swear time slowed, stopped even went backwards. At 2:15 he took his last breath. The good news is that we were out of town and my kids were with my parents also out of town. They came home and spent an hour with him and got to say good bye. As soon as they left was when he knew it was time and got up to walk to the kitchen. Watching that clock slowly tick by was so torturous it‚Äôs hard to explain. Hugs your pets and sorry for the sad post
The last 200 meters of a run when you're absolutely gassed but you still want to finish off strong. Every second feels like an eternity.
When you're driving and approaching a green light. It's been green for awhile and you just *know* it's gonna turn yellow right at that awkward spot where you can't go through the light but you can't stop smoothly, either.

"The sound of the phone ringing when you‚Äôre waiting to give the person on the other end bad news. 


I have a story like this about the longest, most frustrating phone call of my life: 

I was 17 waiting at school for my sister to pick me up, but it was getting later and later so I assumed she forgot or lost track of time. Then I get a phone call from her and when I pick up, I hear her frantic on the other end. In between sobs, she says ‚ÄúI just got in a car accident... it‚Äôs really bad... it‚Äôs really bad...there‚Äôs blood...‚Äù and then she hangs up. 

Panicking, I dial my mom right away, and here‚Äôs how the call goes: 

My mom picks up. Me: ‚ÄúJ____ just got in a car accident! I don‚Äôt know where she is!‚Äù 

My mom, calmly: ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù 

Me: ‚ÄúMom, J_____ just got in a car accident!! She‚Äôs hurt!!‚Äù 

My mom, cheerfully: ‚ÄúHold on... I‚Äôm at the hair salon. The blow dryer is going. I can‚Äôt hear ya‚Äù 

Me, shouting into the phone: MOM!!! J_____ JUST GOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT!! ITS REALLY BAD!‚Äù 

My mom, still cheerful: ‚ÄúOop, I‚Äôm getting a call on the other line... hang on a minute‚Äù 

She switches over to the other call and I am sitting there freaking out. 

Suddenly, my mom switches back to my call and says in a serious voice ‚Äú[my name], J____ just got into a car accident!‚Äù 

I was like ‚ÄúYEAH I KNOW THATS WHAT IVE BEEN SAYING‚Äù 

Apparently my sister had been on the phone with her boyfriend when the accident happened, so he called my mom to tell her while I was on the other line. 

The whole thing was probably 2 minutes but it felt like 2 hours and some of the longest seconds of my life"
30 seconds in a fistfight against an opponent clearly stronger than you, when your honor is on the table.
"(Not personal experience, just knowledge). 
When a guy says something ""risky"" and there's this long pause from the girlfriend/wife. And when she finally responds, she says "" . . . ok."" in a really calm tone. (That's normally not a good sign)."
The moment my daughter was born and came out deathly silent and purple... thanks to quick work by the NHS midwives they whisked her away and from what I can tell cave her a vigorous run down... then she started crying. Longest 30 seconds. Completely helpless.
The 30 seconds of excruciating pain at the dentist when the technician has put what must be a razor blade at an awkward angle in your mouth and told you to ‚Äúbite down‚Äù on it while she/he walks leisurely out of the room to hit the X-ray button and back in to remove said razor blade.
"Specific to me...

"Asking students a question and waiting for them to answer

The longest lasting 30-seconds for me is the middle of the current 30-second period. It just moves through time with me and we‚Äôre always stuck in it.

Oddly enough, fainting. I just experienced fainting for the first time earlier this week *(thanks nervous system)* and while the portion where you‚Äôre actually unconscious is VERY brief, the leading up to the passing out felt like it had taken a full 3 or 4 minutes *(my gauge for this is that it felt about as long as it takes to wait for some hot pockets to finish cooking)* but in reality it had happened in about 30 or so seconds. It was definitely an experience!
"When you're in the ER after your loved one shoots himself and the doctor's explaining his condition, and you just want to know if he is alive or dead.

Carrying something that's juuuust a little too heavy. But you can see your destination, and it's not far away, but you're almost dropping the thing and you can feel it sloooowly slipping and you're thinking about whether or not to stop and try to get a better grip or if you maybe hurried up a bit maybe you'd make it to the car after all and you decide not to stop but you've still got a little ways to go and it's still slowly slipping from your grip but you think you can make it and then BAM! you've dropped and destroyed grandma's priceless grandfather clock that she's had since her wedding and that she keeps even though it doesn't work right because it reminds her of her dead husband, your grandfather, who you loved because he'd play with you in the tire swing of their backyard all the time when you were growing up.

I was a combat medic in the army during the Iraq war (OIF). In order to get to some casualties, I had to run across an alley way that was being LIT UP by gunfire. I distinctly remember thinking for a split second ‚Äúokay, mommesthingever, don‚Äôt die!‚Äù and then running as fast as I could to the other side of the alley.

"Keep in mind, I am pretty shy in new situations, and this is one of them. I would have to say slow dancing with him at prom. He was very sweet and smart, really liked history and music, all that. My mind was zoned out at the start of the song, but in the last 30 seconds it just felt like hours and hours had gone by. Felt like I could have stayed there forever, you know, and as it ended, we drifted apart and I went to the balcony area to get some fresh air, to think. He of course caught up with me and we ended up seated at a table outside, alone. We sat there appreciating each other‚Äôs presence, arm around me and quietly singing ‚ÄúBlue Moon‚Äù together. It was a good moment, nice and peaceful and simply perfect. I did not want it to end, but eventually we had to go our separate ways... as my mom picked me up (I was a sophomore, he was a senior), her car was having trouble and the battery eventually died in a Sprout‚Äôs parking lot. He actually followed us out of the dance in his car, and pulled over to help (he was such a car guy, it was adorable). We ended up having to wait another hour and a half in that parking lot just talking, my mom in her car working and waiting for AAA. We talked about our lives, and his friends, his college choice, all that. Just those sweet and simple conversations made this one of the best nights of my life. I liked him a lot. 

Then he *broke my heart* and left for college, and found a girlfriend within the first week. They‚Äôre still together and it‚Äôs a big oof‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"

Waiting for someone to find information they should've had ready before they called, and having to listen to them make those stupid fucking noises.

"I was once hit by a car on a highway junction while riding my motorbike. He was doing a 50 on a 20 sign. I was taking a U-turn at the junction and decided to switch lanes to allow the trucker behind me overtake. Was an unpleasant surprise when I saw the car behind the truck speeding at me and I practically couldn't do anything about it. The accident was imminent. In the next 30 seconds I got rammed by the car on the left, my motorbike got dragged along the road for about 70 metres while I was still in the air about to crash into the still accelerating car's hood. Those 30 seconds felt like forever, and I was there recollecting all the good and the bad that happened to me throughout my life, and how this probably was the end of me. Luckily, nothing too bad happened to the both of us, but for a hairline fracture in my left ankle. The guy took full responsibility for the accident and even compensated full for the hospital charges.

And what sucks? You stuck a giant needle in my mouth and now you‚Äôre sticking what is practically a DOOR STOP to keep my mouth open so I don‚Äôt bite my tongue off in a delirious & numb state while you drill into my teeth.

Getting 4 root canals at 12-13 yo wasn‚Äôt fun. I can still hear that drill. And the dentist had the radio on as if to block it out. The sounds of 2013 Miley Cyrus and the weird wave-like sounds from the Nitrous machine was just... horrific. Horrifically numb."

When your son is born and is blue, makes no noise, and isn‚Äôt breathing. The delay between when he came out and when cried was probably longer than 30 seconds, but not by much.

"Happened to an actor friend of mine in a Shakespeare play 10 years ago...

She was onstage reciting her lines (normal), and another actor playing her servant enters (normal)... but the servant forgot an important prop that was critical to plot development. He says ""I forgotteth the letter"", excused himself, and exited the stage to get it from the prop table.

The longest 45-seconds of her life was to adlib... in Shakespearean English... but being mindful not to accidentally reveal plot information in the letter that her character wasn't aware of yet. Basically making shit up in another language AND keeping in character... it's tough.

Turns out one of the stagehands accidentally tucked the letter prop into his pocket and forgot to set it back on the prop table (it fell off and before people could step on it, he tucked in his shirt). It was an honest mistake but my actor friend rightfully reamed him because an error like that - with a less-experienced actor onstage to handle it - could derail a show... especially since there were critics in the front row watching."

"Bump started an old Citro√´n CX that had been lying for about four weeks after suffering a major electrical failure.  No biggie, it's a diesel, it doesn't need electrics, give it a shove, get it rolling, pop the clutch and off it goes.

But it's been standing for four weeks.

So there's absolutely no pressure anywhere in the hydraulic system.  The hydraulic system which operates the suspension, power steering, and braking systems.

Normally there's a tiny bit left in the brakes, but not after four weeks.  So the first fifteen seconds rolling across the yard with about a quarter turn of play in the steering and then ridiculously heavy to turn, no brakes at all because the handbrake was faulty, and the suspension right down on its bump stops - that was a very, very long 15 seconds."

But if you really need to pee but want to be there right when it's done, then suddenly that minute is the fastest minute ever and you'll never make it back to the microwave before you can finish peeing and washing you're hands. The pee always takes a little longer than you think. But it makes the microwaving and peeing both go by faster! Self competition right there

At this point we were about to call the police, I decided to go into my oldest brother's bedroom (who was not home at the time) and looked in his closet. He has a walk in closet and has a pile of clothes on the floor, I looked in and saw my little sister buried in the pile of clothes..just sleeping. I yelled out to my parents we found her and all was well. Huge freak out moment and it felt so long. Scary moment but glad she wasn't abducted or something.

"For me it was the threading an elastic band through the chain link that was poking through my gums to pull up a stubborn molar that wouldn't make its way to the surface.

I had the baby tooth pulled a few years prior to make way for the adult tooth but it just wouldn't come in. So a chain was attached in surgery (took my wisdom teeth out too). I guess the chain was resting on a nerve because it was the most terrible pain I've ever felt, even 20years later.

I had to have the chain threaded several times and the last few they numbed the area. The first time I actually OD'd on pain meds accidentally. I was sitting on the couch after getting home and couldn't keep my eyes open. Fun times."

When I was a kid, playing hide and seek, I think I developed some sort of mind conditioning that as soon as I hid, I got the insanely acute urge to pee. No idea why, as soon as I was discovered, the urge would go away. But hiding for those 30 seconds or so felt like forever to me.

Having to make up your mind that this stranger may force you to use lethal force is the scariest experience you could imagine. In a career of 10 years, I drew my weapon three times. None of those times did I fire, but the possibility of taking someone's life for their poor decisions is terrifying for all of us. Those seconds drag on, but also happen so fast."

"I was hiking in the hills of Scotland while on a backpacking holiday. 
One particularly misty morning while hiking, In a clich√©d move fit for an 80s wilderness thriller movie, I stepped on a rock that gave way causing my foot to roll and me to trip.
Here I am, in my teens, with a backpack on, wearing mittens, slipping down the side of some unknown mountain in Scotland. I clawed and grasped at the grass and ground around me doing everything in my power to slow my descent, but I knew full well my fate was sealed. It was in this revelation, looking death square in the face that this ultimate calm washed over my body, I went limp accepting that fate. 
Because I went limp it caused my body to become its own anchor and stopped sliding and rolling down the mountain. 
I survived with nothing more than hurt pride, ripped mittens and some undies that I had to toss. 

Because time felt as if it had slowed down, that whole incident felt like a lifetime... and it was still quicker than the last 30 second countdown on this microwave while I wait for these 2 minute noodles to heat up."

"Sitting behind a gate at the starting line of a dirt bike race... 

They raise a ""30 second board"" to tell you to get ready. You could have upwards of 30-40 people on the line with you all ready to fight to be ahead into the first turn. The 30 second board then turns sideways, which means that the gate - a small metal bar that blocks your front tire when up but falls down to be rolled over - will drop anywhere between 0-5 seconds. 

It's maddeningly intense. Very out of body as you watch the gate, engine revving, ready to drop the clutch and get some purchase with the back wheel and to probably bounce off the people next to you as you go from a wide starting area into a much more narrow first turn. 

If you are first into the turn, it is called getting the ""holeshot"", and you feel like a caged animal set free."

Then the 30-60 seconds pass and the grief emotions hit you like a truck into a brick wall, at least then you feel like you exist. But in those first 30 seconds, time stretches out forever, it‚Äôs such a limbo, like you exist on a different level of consciousness, outside of time.

Brushing my teeth while I'm stoned. There's always a point where I start feeling like I've been standing there brushing the same quadrant for a very long time and maybe I missed the timer or possibly even more than one. How long have I been here? Is my sense of time so dilated that it's possible it hasn't been 30 seconds yet? It feels like it's probably been several minutes already!

My husband says that the actual lasering part of LASIK surgery feels like an eternity of pain and fear. It's over in just a couple minutes, but feels like so much longer because of the smell of your eyes literally being burned by lasers, the loud cracking of the laser itself, the immense pressure of the machine forcing your eyelids completely open... and it didn't help that he could see the previous person's surgery on screen in the waiting area... Sounded pretty horrible to me! But he loves being glasses-free. üôÉ

"Perspective from a now retired police officer.. 

The first 30 seconds when we pull over a car and walk up to the driver. Not knowing if the person was speeding because they are late for work, have a pregnant passenger, or if they are just going to shoot and kill you as soon as you walk up to the car because they just robbed a bank and THAT'S why they were speeding... It's not a good feeling... 

Every single traffic stop of my career had that few seconds where you're just hoping it's not your day to die. 

Simultaneously- when a fellow officer gets ""toned out"" because they aren't answering their radio when dispatch or other officers call them many times .. that's a painful 30 seconds. 

My partner was once toned out when he got into a fight with a teenager who had stabbed someone during a burglary, and in the scuffle, there was a taser, and then the kid ended up knee deep in water - anyway- they got locked together- his hand clamped down on the taser and they were locked together getting electrocuted together, in the water... 

When we got there, we had to use sticks to get the taser away- both the cop and the kid needed medical attention because it could have been upwards of 5 minutes they were locked together getting tased. It was NOT good. 

The time it took me to drive there, after he was toned out and didn't answer...I was thinking he could be dead and every single person on the radio at dispatch and on the road was absolutely a wreck waiting for him to answer..."

Many people say P L A N K but I‚Äôve had one time when 2 seconds felt like 30, and it was when I somehow flew over my bike‚Äôs steering wheel at 5mph, got a deep cut on my leg and landed almost on my neck. I can remember exactly when I was trying to grab onto the steering wheel when I was upside down and how I blacked out for a little and felt that I landed.

I paid out of pocket for a 450 dollar test to start my career in IT. I had failed it once prior, but had one retake. After falling it once, having similar questions as the last time, but not the same, I was terrified of having to spend another 450 bucks. I answered the last question, and clicked toward the point of getting my score. There's 3 pages of useless information, and then survey questions after you submit your test. 30 seconds of pure agony before i found out what was promised for the next 6 months of my life. Would I be homeless? Would I have to move back in with my parents? I got to the next screen where my score would be displayed. I fucking passed. I nearly cried, because it was only days before I would be let go from a well paying job if I failed this test. Fuck those questions at the end, and fuck you Pearson vue.

Don't bullshit me doctors. Just say it will hurt like hell but in a few days the pain will go away."
"One of my dogs had this medical issue where he randomly had a bad reaction to specific medication. It would make him suddenly cry out in pain and fall over and go deadly still. I mean *deadly* still.

Then about ten seconds later he would suddenly inhale, shake his head, and get back up. The first time it happened I was utterly shocked and terrified.

As soon as we switched medications he stopped doing it. This was a very long time ago, and I forgot exactly what medication it was that caused the problem."

More like 5 seconds than 30 but I was clotheslined by a wire at 30 mph on my bike. Had the wire been 6 inches higher it would have caught my throat and I would have likely died. I distinctly remember seeing that wire about a quarter second before it got me, getting knocked off my bike, sliding along the pavement. While sliding I looked down at my gloved hands and thinking hope glad I was to be wearing them. I glanced behind me to make sure there were no cars coming at me, and then I realized my knees were getting torn up and rolled into my back so my backpack would take the rest of the road rash.

This is less than 30 seconds but...

The camera came spinning off the tripod, hit the floor face up, and I rushed to pick it back up and pretend like nothing happened. It was a fairly casual livestream so I just explained that we're all melting in the summer heat, including our tripod, and it was fine but going back that felt SO LONG between the camera flying off and getting back to normal but looking back at the footage it was a 4-second gaffe

I fell in the shower once. The moment my foot slipped it was like time slowed to a crawl. Razor in my left hand? Quickly hold arm away from body. Falling to the right?

So I was flying down the freeway between Reno and the California border. I am on the tail end of a road trip with my friend Steven. Steven doesn‚Äôt have a license, so I had to drive the entire way. This was 7 hours into driving that day. We were going 70ish on a straight away, and a slow truck was in front of me. I decide to pass. (Start 30 seconds) I check to see I‚Äôm clear; I am.  I start accelerating, and see it‚Äôs a double long truck trailer. No biggie, I speed up to 90 to be safe. As I‚Äôm passing, about half a mile down the road a random Van pulls adjacent to the highway on a dirt road that barely connects with the road. As I see the van I have the split second thought, ‚Äúhe better look before he turns onto the road‚Äù my heart stops as I see his wheels start to lurch forward. He turns, while I‚Äôm going 90, and I‚Äôm now maybe 200 feet from the car. Less than a second from hitting it. I would cut off the truck and die if I turned right back into my lane. I pull on the wheel as hard as I can left. I rip into the dirt, feel a gust of wind as the van rips between the truck and me, and I rip the wheel back putting my car on two wheels. I bounced once on the two wheels, and then slammed into the dirt/pavement. I was going about 70-75 once I righted the car, and I finished passing the truck. Steven was asleep and I woke him up with this. This moment is seared into my memory and is the longest 30 seconds of my life.

Ten seconds, and the regret, the grief, the sixteen-year-old who cursed herself for all the feelings she hadn't felt yet, and all the things she hadn't done, and all the things she wished she did, and then fifteen, and wanting to undo it, to stitch together the wound you've made but she couldn't, she couldn't anymore. Twenty, and wanting to run out to the parents who abused her so badly and beat her until they couldn't anymore and even though she could see her father's face inches above her - red-faced, out of breath, panting - as clear as the day he beat her nearly to death, all she wanted was to run to him and to say I want to live, my God, I want to live. Twenty five, and I want to live. I want to live so fucking badly, and what did she *do?* What was she thinking? And thirty, and she feels colder still, but she can't run anymore.

"I play a VR game called onward.  I used to play competitively.  In the last match of the semi finals, we had a tie breaker.  Winner got a free trip to the UK, and we would have qualified for one of the top 4 prize spots, which were $30,000, $20,000, $15,000 and $10,000.  Thats split amoung me and my team of 8, so not really as much money as it sounds, but the trip the the UK, with free airfare and all expenses paid, and a chance to meet and party with my team for playing a video game is my childhood dream.

Anyways, I was the last one left on my team, when there was around 30 seconds left on the clock.  All I had to do was keep the enemy team (still 4 up) from capping the objective (we were on defense).  I have never felt my heart beat so fast, even though I was just sitting in a corner defending the objective.  You need to aim like you would in real life, and I could not keep my hands from shaking.  It was a huge let down when they killed me.  I only made about $300 that season.

This is what I missed in finals at the UK:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VrORl\_oBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VrORl_oBQ)

Recently, I was in a delivery for someone with twins and the second baby came out butt first, so the head ended up getting stuck. Watching the doctor try to pull his head out was the longest fifteen seconds of my life. I think I said about a hundred prayers and I‚Äôm hardly religious."

"The first 30 seconds of courage, or is it the 30 seconds before?

There‚Äôs a line in the movie *Akeela and the Bee* (a little girl, a spelling bee) that was something along the lines of, ‚Äúall you need is just 10 seconds of courage,‚Äù and that really stuck with me.  Those first seconds are all you need to get you going.  I think it‚Äôs fantastic."

The plank exercise. I just want a stronger core, not feel like the world is spinning circles around me.
I work the X-ray machine in the operating room. It‚Äôs a big ass hunk of junk. It takes at least five minutes to boot up. Right when the doctor wanted an X-ray during a hip replacement at the most difficult time during surgery. A nurse kicks the plugs out of the socket and my machine dies. It was the longest amount of time to boot up, followed with ‚Äúis it ready?!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs taking so damn long?!‚Äù.

Rewatching the seconds after and reaction to the challenger explosion. It was the last time the US actually all came together in pride hoping to witness a scientific achievement, and it flopped in the most horrific possible fashion.

I shudder thinking about it.

I remember being very down at my ex's college graduation, because we just had a fight. She left the university premises, and I stayed at a bench in front of my old college building, staring blankly at nothing. 

Then after a while, I heard a voice. ""what are you dong here?"" And when I looked up I saw my bestfriend, coming towards me. Its like time slowed--it is like a movie scene where she's walking towards me with a smile on her face while leaves are falling all around us like an autumn shower. 

It's the time I realized I really like her--no, that I've liked her all this time, and I'm just trying to convince myself that I don't by dating other ladies. 

As she stood in front of me, waiting for a response for the question that was asked seemingly hours ago, I may have smiled in relief. 

We ended up hanging out with some other people for the rest of the day, taking photos in a sunflower garden, eating at a nearby mall, just plain walking around our old university with a dash of nostalgia.

"Last year we were skiing with two of my younger siblings. Weather was awful all weekend and finally, the last day, at noon, the clouds disappeared, so we decided to climb to the highest point (we've never been there). So we started climbing and the clouds showed up again, to the point we couldn't see 2 meters away. We had to descent, so we went slowly, following other people. My sister freaked out and fell, and in an attempt to help her, I took of my skis... And I started to slide off the mountain.

Tried to grab myself to it, even my brother tried to stop me, but in ten seconds I couldn't see them anymore. I couldn't see anything at all. And I was sliding faster and faster.

It must have been less than a minute, but I thought that was it. 

And then, I started to slow down and I finally stopped. The clouds started to dissipate and I saw my siblings way up. Some good people helped my sister get back on track and brought me my skis. We recognized a known spot, and we continued our way to the bottom."
Kissing my husband. Feeling the whiskers of his beard on my face, his soft lips, the way he caresses my hair and holds my face with one hand, and holds my waist with the other...Every kiss is like it's from a movie. Even just a goodbye smooch feels like a make out sesh.

Had to take my dad off life support due to covid19. It was June 25th, a Thursday. Just me and my gf were able to be there, even then we had to stay behind the glass door. He was on life support for 13 days, and everyday some else was beginning to fail on him. My dad died about 10 days before his 70th birthday. He did have copd and that's what probably did it in. We lasted talk on June 7th, it was brief he was in the hospital, he called again at 2:59p and I missed that call. After it was all over I asked when he was incubated and it was June 7th at 3:10p. I believe he was calling to say bye, I know that once he was told what was going to happen he knew it was over. They put him in a coma and perilized him. When we took him off on the 25th he lasted 45 minutes. It was the longest moment of my life and I just wanted him to slip away, even though that sounds bad. This was the first time I wrote about it. Sorry if I rambled.
I mean everyone had these really intense stories, but like I think wall sits and planks last forever lmao.

The first 30 seconds or so after coming to rest on the pavement I couldn't take a breath.  I couldn't even get a little air.

When you're in chronic pain, and you get a lightening bolt of pain so hard it takes your breath away, and you can't focus on anything but the pain.  All I can do is try to breathe through it, clench my eyes shut, and reassure myself, it'll end soon.  Those are the longest seconds of my life.

Me: I don't mind needles.

Nurse: One more!

The most galling thing was when the tests came back. 'Yes, you have Bells Palsy.' 'Okay, what do we do about it?' 'Nothing. It will probably go away.' WHAT"

The time when my annual class result was coming out. In the 10th grade in my country, the exams are conducted by the governing body and results come out on their website.

I was scuba diving in a deeper lake in upstate NY. It was our 100ft dive, part of my certification. I knew ahead of the dive that at 100ft the water temps are well below freezing, and that if you breathe too heavy there is a chance your regulator can freeze open and let all of your air out. Of course, this happened to me. I watched my air gauge go from full to empty in a matter of seconds. At that point I gave my partner the signals to go up and up I went. He didn‚Äôt take the hint. When my air finally ran out, I did not have the pony bottle regulator secured in my hand. That... was a long few seconds trying to find it alone in the dark with nothing above, below, or in front of me other than the beam of a flashlight. I thought I was done.

Back when I was a kid, we would corn the younger kids to kinda bully them into toughening up. I guess you young people today would call it hazing, but it wasn't really to get into a club or anything. It was just something the older kids did to the younger kids. What we'd do is go out to the old bathtub, you see there was an old outdoor bathtub behind the stores on Central Street, and we' tell a younger kid to lie down in there and cross their arms and legs and not to move a muscle otherwise we'd punch them right in the chops, I got punched in the chops quite a bit actually, and after they're good and still, the older kids would take bags of dried corn and bury the kid in kernels. I mean, we're talking young kids here, so it was easy to fully submerge the tykes in corn kernels. We'd give 'em about a minute or longer in the corn tub before trying to dig them out. That first 30 seconds ain't that bad, but that last 30 seconds or longer, yikes. I think every kid in the corn tub swallowed or inhaled at least a few kernels. The worst, or best if you were an older kid, part was that if they flailed in the first 30 seconds and tried to bust outta the corn tub, we'd clock 'em a few times in the shoulders and thighs as punishment, and then they'd have to go right back into the corn tub until they got it right. They'd come out coughing and gasping and shaking, but they'd be laughing about it before long. Hey, it made us better boys and girls, didn't it? We're hearty folk around here, and the corn tub has to have had something to do with it!
"Surprised it took me all the way down to your comment for this. The closest I have come is being flipped out of a white water raft. I was most definitely under for less than 30 seconds, but it felt like forever. 

We failed to perform a high side and everyone but the guide was tossed out of the boat. The raft came back down upside right. I didn't know this but all I could tell was that I couldn't get up to the surface (I was under the raft). Reaching around for anything I felt another person. I pulled them up and they went higher than I was. Turned out that was my sister and she surfaced next to the boat. I pulled my self that way and final got air. All in total it could not have been more than 10 seconds, 15 to tops. But it felt like eternity."
"I was looking for this.   
Longest 30 seconds of my life was when I was at the bottom of a pool, then right as I was coming up a bunch of kids with huge inflatable toys blocked my way.

Absolutely- I took a scuba class in college and some of the drills/exercises often involved you feeling panicked at the bottom of the pool. I didn‚Äôt realize how stressful it was until after the semester during Xmas break when I thought ‚ÄúWow, I don‚Äôt have to feel like I‚Äôm drowning this week.... so nice.‚Äù
Yep. I recently flipped on an inflatable kayak while white water rafting. Was recycled for probably 4 seconds. I thought ‚Äúthis is how I die‚Äù
Getting waterboarded, it's awful. You just get grabbed and held under, let up, held under on repeat for a few minutes and then after all that the dizziness and coughing fits that go on for a lil once it's over and you wonder if this is over for now or about to start again. Those few seconds waiting for something to happen or not are the worst.
I almost drowned in the lazy river at my water park. It's only  like 3-4 feet of water but I was a kid and feel through the hole of the tube but my legs were still stuck above water. I was guaranteed dead and my dad finally noticed and pulled me up. Scariest moment if my life.
As a kid, I almost drowned going down a slide in a waterpark. One of those enclosed, twisty slides. No idea what I was doing wrong, but water kept splashing in my face and I was not able to breathe the whole way down. Never passed out but once I got to the bottom I remember just sitting there clinging onto conciousness, too weak to stand myself up. It was horrific.
Holy shit I feel this. I went swimming in the ocean once and got smashed by a big wave. I turned over a couple times and I definitely was only underwater for like 3-4 seconds, but that shit felt like years.
"I remember playing this browser game years ago that simulated drowning. You had to constantly scroll up with the mouse wheel.

I only lasted, like, 4 minutes. It was terrifying."
Was white water rafting when I was in Boy Scouts (age 17) when we hit a rapid and I was launched off and got trapped underwater pushed downward by the force of the nearby rapid. My head hit a rock and I went into a dazed state. My limp body was tossed around and then spat out above the surface. My lungs burnt and my eyes felt like they were going to pop out of my skull. It felt like I was trapped under for several minutes when it had only been a little over 30 seconds. I still remember every second of it. The creeping cold feel under the darkness with the light peeking into the water. The terrifying feeling of being unable to swim upward and then hitting the rock and feeling like I was just done for. Crazy experience. Would still go rafting again for sure but near drowning experience still feels like the worst thing ever.
It doesn‚Äôt even have to get to the point of almost drowning to make time move slowly. Whenever I‚Äôm in the sea and I get knocked over and flipped underwater by a wave and then another one before I manage to get up from the previous hit until I‚Äôm eventually thrown onto the shore, it feels like it‚Äôs been several minutes instead of the approximately seven seconds it actually was.
"Oh man. You brought back memories from a trip to Key West my parents, my sister, and I took like a decade ago. We rented a two person kayak thing. And my sister and I were just kayaking around the shore. And our kayak flipped at one point. Now the thing is. I think they were sea urchins but there were thousands of them on the floor. And I was tall enough to be able to stand up on the floor covered with urchins while my sister wasn‚Äôt and was floating with her vest. It took us a long while to reflip the kayak and get back on. Thing is I was simultaneously holding my sister up with one shoulder so she could be helpful while more and more urchin shards got into my feet. It took atleast 5-10 minutes but felt like an hour. I remember everyone behind us on shore and close by were watching us. At least 100 people out that day. Man if you looked at my feet that day and the next like two to three weeks, you‚Äôd think it was diseased from all the black dots. 

Now that I think about it. I think I developed tryptophobia that day.

Edit: typo"
My childhood abuser used to hold me under the water, and fuck, it felt like an eternity before he would let me up. He always did but each time felt like I was done for.
Yes! Not exactly drowning but once I took a course in how to barrel roll a kayak. I missed the first session but the next week I went there and the instructor told me to just roll the kayak over and he‚Äôd see what I could do. I was confused as fuck but just turned it upside down and then stayed there, upside down underwater in the kayak while waiting for him to do something. I have no clue how long I was under there- probably less than 30 seconds but I did start panicking and I fully thought I was going to die in a shallow swimming pool after misinterpreting the guy‚Äôs instructions.
"When I was about 7 or 8, I went swimming with a friend of mine. He was bigger than me, but he didn't swim as well. The pool we were swimming in had a sharp drop-off between the shallow part and the deeper, and I could swim either just fine. But he took one foot off the drop and started flailing. 

Being the nice kid I was, I reached out my hand to pull him back. 

BIG MISTAKE. 

Instinct kicked in and he pulled me to him, pushed me under and used me to try to keep himself afloat. I don't know how long it lasted, surely less than a minute, but I could swear I was under there for a half hour. I watched other kids swimming by, minding their own business. A few jumped in, and carefully avoided us. I was frustrated, wishing some of them would come and help, but I could do anything to signal them. 

It didn't take long for his mom and aunt to take notice and an adult jumped in to get us to safety. But I'll never forget the unending time beneath the water while my friend tried to drown me."
My biggest concern after swimming in Lake Erie was whether or not I would later grow a third arm out my forehead from all the toxic chemicals (was all that far from where the Cuyahoga river emptied into the lake)
There are some fears I've had that I've got over the older I get. Drowning though - every time the topic comes up on reddit for instance, it just confirms I am right to be afraid of any situation where this might happen to me. I will continue to avoid most me+water situations where this is even a remote possibility.
"This. Only happened to me a handful of times, but I remember all of them in detail because of how terrifying it is.

Once as a teen when a friend/bully snuck up behind me at the beach and held me under for a few seconds, and another while cliff diving when I got stuck in the downward pull from a nearby waterfall. SImilar sensations trying to learn to surf and getting stuck int eh wave for a few seconds- that feels like drowning in a washing machine."
I didn't drown but when you're in the pool and someone splashes water all over you, that feels like forever when it's really 3 seconds
Recently I was on a local lake jet skiing. I went over a wave wrong, hit my head and back on the water and got all the wind knocked out of me. A wave splashed water in my mouth and I thought I was done. That life jacket saved my life. It took a good 5 minutes to slowly and painfully swim to the jet ski
I‚Äôm a goddamn swim coach and once I went snorkeling in the Caribbean and got stuck over some extremely shallow coral. I wasn‚Äôt drowning, but I knew that I had to get the fuck out of there or I‚Äôd get cut the fuck up- those 30 seconds of frantic swimming nose-to-nose with the reef still freak me out when I think about it.  If I wasn‚Äôt a strong swimmer I definitely would have been toast.
Wondering how old you are?..To mention Gorden Lightfoot.  Seems his name is everywhere, after a long time not being noticed. Glad you made it out of lake Erie. Water has its ways of making things feel so different and unpredictable.
I turned over in a friend's canoe pretty far out one time while everyone else was close to shore, and the fucking thing filled with water because I didn't know what I was doing. I panicked because I couldn't lose my friend's canoe, so I hooked my arm into it while it was fully submerged and filled with water, and swam one-armed all the way to shore. Never been more exhausted/panicked in my life.
Yknow that makes sense now, I had been sucked under by a wave and the probably half a second I was under felt like a good 10-15. Especially after I hit my head and it knocked all the air out of my lungs
I was stuck out at the beach one time. I was only about 7 and knew swim sideways in a rip and stuff. But as soon as it was happening i just started to panic and swim in. I ended up realising my mistake and going to the side. But my cousin who was with me hasn‚Äôt gone back into the water more that 10 years later
"When I was about 12, I went boogie boarding (body boarding?) with my family and there were some pretty big waves out. While riding a wave in my board got pulled underwater and nose dived straight into the sand. I slammed into it stomach first and then slid past it with the current, and the board strap which I had tied to my ankle held me under the surface, and I was just dangling in the current like a kite in the wind. Once the wave passed, I think my board slipped out of the sand and I floated above water.

This all happened so fast that I really didn‚Äôt have time to process that I could have drowned, but that moment when I was dangling helplessly by the strap felt like it lasted forever."
"At my local non-neighborhood pool, my uncle & cousins were away from me & I suddenly went under. There was a random ass 10 foot circle in the 4ft rectangle of water. The water was kind of spiraling down. Well, I stepped into it without knowing & went under for probably less than 15 seconds & it was the worst 15 seconds ever. 

One side was 4ft to 6 ft deep on one side, the other side was deeper for swimming laps. Why that random circle 10 ft deep was there is beyond me."
"Can relate, one time when I was around 11 I was with my friend and her cousins. I and her family were hanging out at a river that felt more like a beach. It was a popular tourist attraction anyway we were fucking around and swam away from them to the part where canoes and fishers go, the current got strong so we tried to swim to the other side of the river so we could walk up the hiking trail back to where her parents were. I wasn't a really strong swimmer but her whole family did swimming professionally. It felt like they got there in 2 minutes. I, on the other hand, was struggling. One of the scariest things I've experienced was being 11 and every time I got my head up to breathe it was just pushed back down into the water, I started to panic and couldn't swim properly, I eventually made it close enough to the edge that a grabbed on to a branch of the side and climbed onto that. They didn't even bat an eye ""finally your here, cmon let's head back in starving!"" And ran off. It probably only took around 4 minutes but that 4 minutes felt like it went on forever, and I can't get the thought out of my head. Every time I think about it I can remember what it was like not being able to breathe, to be only 11 and thinking ""oh my God, this is where I die. I won't get to see my mum again, the last thing I said to her was 'of course ill be safe' wait, my little sister. She's only 9 but she's going to lose another sister, and I had a fight with her before I left"" I've had 2 more near-death experiences but none were as scary as that one"
I once got stuck under a (dont know the technical term) barrel raft which was like floating because of these barrels full of air tied to some wooden planks. I remember me and another student at the time falling off and being trapped underneath because my life jacket was keeping me against the barrels and I had just breathed in a lot of water, felt like minutes I was under but an instructor managed to pull the raft off
I got caught in a small rip tide caused by a space between two concrete wave breakers. I saw what was going to happen and tried to escape, but the pull of the water grabbed me and pulled me under. I remember thinking about my parents on shore and how they might never know what happened. It felt like I was pulled a mile out, the water was so fast. But the strong current ended maybe 6 feet behind the wall and it was shallow water still. Maybe 3 feet deep. I was probably under water for 10 seconds, but was certain that was the end. Walked back to the wall, climbed over it, swam back to shore. Never fucked with wave breakers again and now I have a strong respect for water.
Can we talk more about how the searchers all day they‚Äôd a made White Fish Bay if they put 15 more miles behind her.
Happened to me too, just today as well. It likely was a matter of habit because i‚Äôm not used to holding my breath for so long and rather new to swimming. I was in the deepest end of the pool and practicing treading water. I accidentally exhaled all of my air and was brought down halfway towards the bottom. Scariest thing that‚Äôs happened in recent memory as my lungs inmediately felt like they were going to burst. My lungs still hurt even several hours after the incident
You, my friend, need to stay the hell away from water. Third time ain't the charm when it comes to this kind of bad mojo.
Same, was at a local pool for summer camp/day camp and I wanted to be like everyone else and go down the slide holy cow under water for 20-30 seconds and it felt like forever I still remember it clearly and it happened when I was like 6 or 7 and I'm 24.
I've been swimming in white water since I was very young, you can definitely condition yourself not to panic when trapped underwater. It still feels like time stretches out though...
"When I was a kid at a daycare (maybe 1st-3rd grade or so iirc), we would go to one of the owner's farmhouses to swim in her pond as one of the field trips.  I was a strong swimmer, and could go into the deep parts with no issue.  Other kids were not.

I'll never forget when a girl decided to jump off the dock near me, couldn't swim, then decided I was the best option to help her.  Having her claw her way onto my back and push me down repeatedly was terrifying.  I was blacking out before one of the adults even noticed.  Luckily they did end up noticing and got me out.

That's probably one of the only vivid memories I have from that time period, if not really the only one.  I don't think I've felt that level of fear again since."
Drowning is terrifying.  I was at Algonquin Park (northern Ontario, Canada), and the ground of the river just dropped off.  I was about 4, and I went under.  Thank goodness my dad rescued me.  Over 30 years later, it still gives me shivers to remember being underwater and not being able to breathe.
I was swimming in the Atlantic in New Hampshire and got my legs taken out by a wave, then couldn't right myself upward as I felt waves pushing me around it was the second scariest water experience i ever had. Scariest was a seemingly innocent watering hole at the corner of a river. I didn't know there was a powerful current running under the still water, got dragged down and luckily my aunt was there to pull me out. I was pretty young for both, no more than 10. I don't swim outside of pools now.
I went surfing a few years ago and wiped out as the wave was crashing, the wave was about 6 foot so not massive but still a large body of water coming down on top of you. How I fell my board somehow ended up on top of me and with the wave crashing down on it I was essentially pinned to the seabed. It lasted maybe 10secs but it felt like a couple minutes and I was convinced I was done for.
When I was about 12 we were in a cove at a lake and I strapped my legs into a knee board right behind my knees, and it flipped. The closest person was about 30-40 feet away from me and i had to lunch my body forward in what I can only describe as a power crunch to pop my head above water to get air every couple of seconds. Definitely one of the most terrifying and longest moments of my life.
"I‚Äôve actually almost drowned nearly 4 times as a kid. Didn‚Äôt have a great history with water haha. Most of them happened before i was old enough that I could remember anything. 

One of them tho as around when I was 8 and I do remember it so vividly. I got stuck under a floating trampoline thing and was fighting trying to find my way to the surface. I remember feeling around and pounding the underside and kicking my legs around. It definitely felt like a long time under there. But I don‚Äôt know how long it actually was, but I lost consciousness and the next thing I remember is waking on the dock. My sister saw my legs kicking under the float thing and got me out."
"The great lake its said never gives up her dead.

Seriously though this is accurate. I've nearly drowned a couple times and I'm an excellent swimmer."
Canoes terrify me, I have no idea why you‚Äôd ever want to lose the ability to swim while in water. Could only ever go in Kayaks
"I got caught in the surf as the tide came in. Huge waves well over my head crashing down on me, so I ""jump"" to the surface to get air, then get dropped back to the bottom in time to jump again. The outflow wouldn't allow me to move inland (for all I knew I was being pulled out.). Gasping for air. Legs cramping. 
I don't know how long it was..."
The canoe thing happened to a close friend of mine but in Superior, and to make things worse it started pouring down rain and storming
Root Canal fucking sucked. My nerves were too sensitive for painkillers to effect it so I didn't feel the tooth getting drilled, but I felt the shit out of my nerve getting drilled.
Ive had two fillings neither had novocaine. They were shallow first one didnt hurt at all. During the second one my mouth started flooding with saliva i started chocking on and put loads of pressure on the drill. Damn those 3 seconds of trying to stay still seemed to never end.
"When I was 2 I had a cavity and since I was scared the dentist thought tying me to this board would be a smart way to prevent me from moving while stabbing my mouth with that huge ass needle and I had nightmares for weeks afterwards.

My mom brought me to a new dentist but it took 2 years of me going to a new dentist before I stopped running away from him everytime he walked in/got close, then 1 year before I showed him my teeth via smile across the room, and 1 more year after that I finally allowed him to actually touch my teeth.

I still go to that dentist now about 20 years later, and I'm glad my mom didn't force me to allow the dentist to look at my teeth until I was ready to let him. Add to that the dentist's patience and understanding along with his assistants. That is probably why I don't fear dentists, though about 3-5 years ago I had a cavity and was terrified. They actually put me in the young child's section to give me a light bit of laughing gas(? I believe? Not too sure now though) for the needle. I was okay after that though and am even more grateful for them all."
I guess not as many people have experienced a significant earthquake of any duration.  I can tell you the 19 seconds of the 1994 Northridge 6.8 earthquake was unbearable.  In the dark, having been awakened by the ground moving violently in all thee dimensional directions, with items flying at you from the shelves they were on, crashing all around you as you are trying to get your bearings and realize what is happening and what you should be doing (or not doing), it was scary has hell.  Even getting to the door frame after having to pry the door open to get into it, you are still riding it out, and that is only 19 seconds.  30 seconds of that must be insane not knowing if it is going to slow down and stop, get worse as it ramps up.
"Lived in the Seattle area most of my life. Earthquakes were always a couple of seconds of ""what was that?"" By the time you realized what it was, it was over. 

Cue the 2001 Nisqually Earthquake. Lasted nearly a minute. I was outside at the time in Tacoma and watching the ground move was surreal. My (now estranged) wife is from California. She was understandably more freaked out. I knew something was serious by how long it lasted, but didn't have the ""lived in California"" experience to put it in perspective."
The problem with earthquakes are you don't know how long they will last and you have no idea how bad they are (i.e. did they crack a vital canal carrying water to us in S. Cal or bring down a big ass electrical tower bringing electricity to S. Cal.)  A  small one that I feel could be a gigantic, devastating one far away.  I always get a bit antsy no matter the size of the quake I feel.
I still remember being five years old when an earthquake hit and I was getting a haircut. Earthquakes happened often but that was the worst of them all. 7.6 and the place I was at literally broke in half. I remember rushing out with my grandma pulling me out before the place came crashing down. I saw the roof falling in almost slow motion. It felt like everything was moving in slow motion.
A few months ago I remember there was a thread on reddit where people were posting earthquake videos from Japan. I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt live in an earthquake prone area because they looked absolutely terrifying
I'm in southeast Louisiana so hurricanes are a concern...but I can't imagine an earthquake. Terrifying.
"Most are over pretty quickly and it's more the not knowing how long it'll continue that extends the time.

However in the case of the 3/11/11 earthquake it just wouldn't freaking stop, so [I started filming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KivcaxceBU)."
Meanwhile, me a California native during an earthquake: *casually inserts spoonful of cereal into mouth*
I desperately want to live in California, but earthquakes are legit the main reason I won‚Äôt move. The ground beneath me is like the one true constant in my life haha
I only realized how frightening earthquakes must be after feeling the shockwave of the Beirut explosion. The first 4-5 seconds were slight vibrations before the impact of the shockwave and everyone in the house were scared out of their minds, I could only imagine an actual destructive earthquake
"I'm from Oklahoma, where there's been a lot of earthquakes over the past decade or so thanks to fracking. I think the biggest one I've experienced was about a 5.7, which is rough enough that you can definitely feel and hear everything shaking, but not bad enough to be legitimately terrifying. I was also asleep at the time though, and I think it took a little while to wake me up, so I only caught the tail end of it, and was convinced it was just a really vivid dream until I got to work the next day and everyone was talking about it... so maybe it would've been more upsetting if I had actually been lucid. 

The weirdest one I've ever experienced was a couple years later, and one hit while I was using the bathroom, though. Not sure what magnitude that one was, but we were pretty close to the epicenter that time... and feeling the toilet start to rattle violently while you're on it is a distinctly unsettling experience."
"I sat through part of a left turn light and drove a couple blocks before the shaking stopped in the Anchorage 7.1M in 2018. About 1m30s of shaking. It just kept going. 

I at first thought I had blown out two tires on my truck. Then I saw air underneath the tires of the Jeep in front of me at the light. That day and the following week were fucking wild"
"Yes. I was in 9th grade while the SF Bay Area quake shook our house 1 hour east. The street looked like there were sea monsters beneath it. It just kept shaking and shaking.

I was 24 while working for a software company in Seattle (not Microsoft) when a major quake happened. It's epicenter was an hour south. The building was fairly new construction. Apparently it was designed to sway like one of those car lot wavy dudes. Still, it was terrifying hearing things crash to the floor.

I live near Portland, OR. We are due for The Big One. Hopefully not while the Feds or Patriot Prayer or... Are here. During the pandemic. During flu season. In the year 2020. Ugh."
My area, not known for earthquakes, had one maybe 10 years ago. It was relatively mild but within three seconds, I was sure my house was going to fall down. It went from big truck outside to REALLY big truck outside to OMG the world is ending fast. Terrified of experiencing a stronger one.
So very true. The 2001 Nisqually Delta earthquake lasted approximately 40 seconds, but it felt like ten minutes. I have never been so terrified. And to help folks put it in perspective, I have them count out loud from 1-40. It usually hits how long that really was with the earth shaking and the building swaying.
I always drink a glass of water the wrong way around, with the lip touching the far side of the glass you know. You bend over whilst doing this and remain bent until you finished drinking. This always works for me and is barely inconvenient.
A nurse told me to close my ears with my fingers and drink through a straw for 5-10 seconds. It has never failed me and I‚Äôve been doing it for almost 15 years.
"There seems to be nothing I can do to get rid of hiccups except for holding my breath. 30+ years old and still nothing works perfectly everytime. It has actually gotten to the point where I can hold my breath for over 2 minutes just desperately trying to get rid of them. 

Sometimes I literally have my alarm go off in the morning, I wake up, stand up to start getting ready, and then get them. I have coworkers laugh because I can completely carry on a conversation just pausing every 10 seconds or so to completely look like a moron and let the hiccups continue winning."
"And when they said to ""hold your breath"" but not for how long, and you're just waiting for the all-clear to breathe like... do I just pass out here... don't want to mess up these scans."
I had to get a spine MRI to check for arthritis damage. Told me to stay as still as possible, with my knees slightly up. 10 minutes in any my legs are like jelly, my back is hurting because the reason I'm there is because it hurts to lie on my back for short periods. Had to do that shit for an hour. Lost all sense of time after the first 5 minutes.
They kept getting mad at me because I was very much in the midst of an obsessive tick and whenever a machine went quiet I would tap my head
I‚Äôve had more CT‚Äôs and MRI‚Äôs that I care to admit. I had a stroke and those scans felt like forever. Also, waiting to find out about a cancer in my brain.  I had to wait a year to see if it grew. I [do art now](https://society6.com/inspirescape) as a way of coping.
I got LASIK surgery and the 30 secs they tell you to stare at the laser I felt were an eternity. I just kept thinking ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck this up don‚Äôt fuck this up‚Äù or I‚Äôll go blind. I panicked on my right eye and it felt the light was moving to the right so my surgeon had to follow my train of sight. Eye still came out good tho.
Only been in a CT scanner once, when they pump you full of that stuff (barium?), they warm you it may feel like you need the toilet. I honestly thought I was going to shit my pants in their ¬£1m machine.
I scolded my muscles in my head to keep still as my radiologist was pissed for repeating MRI scans for the 3rd time. It felt like forever
The CT scanner was awful! I get muscle spasms if I try to force myself to lay perfectly still. It took them a bit to get decent scans because I couldn't stop spasming (i fell asleep in the end which helped)
I had to get an MRI once, they gave me Xanax to make sure I was able to stay still for the hour. It still felt like an eternity:
I was in one a couple days after tearing almost everything in my knee, so it was still super swollen and sensitive. When they had to pull the leg to straighten it out, then put foam bricks around the leg to make sure it wouldnt move I almost passed out because it hurt so bad.
"YAS... I had to get a CT of my neck and was told to hold perfectly still and whatever I did DON'T SWALLOW (it would ruin the CT and we would have to start over).

I was afraid I would forget not to swallow and then accidentally swallow, so I had to chant in my head ""Don't swallow, don't swallow, don't swallow"" the entire time. 

Which made me desperately need to swallow.

It was torture"
"Had an MRI last november with the radioactive juice in my veins. My mom said i looked like an uncooked hotdog when i came out.

I felt like an uncooked hotdog."
"Is it CT when you have to drink special fluid before, and then also hook you up to another fluid that gets activated together with the machine? Hard to explain, but I hope someone will know what I mean.

I heard that some people say it's not really painful, but for me injecting that fluid into my arm was a horrible experience. It felt like having fire poured into my veins. could feel all the veins from my fingertips to my shoulder, and it was more painful every second.

And you also feel like you peed yourself, not fun, even though they told me I'll feel like it, I was still scared that I actually did it."
The worst for me was a thyroid scan. You have to take this radioactive something on an empty stomach. Then you're in a position on your back with a towel under your neck so your neck is completely exposed.  I had to stay like that for half an hour being told periodically to hold my breath.  I had the worst headache after and got sick in the waiting room.
"Oh not me. I was in so much pain that I actually fell asleep. Well, more of into a stupor I guess, to where the loud noises were comforting and I kind of drifted along with it.

(Keep your wallet in your front pocket, kids!)"
As someone with serve fear of being in tight spots I can only be put in one after being sedated. Though last time I was in one I passed out the guy doing it said I was projectile vomiting black stuff.
When they told me to try not to swallow. I think I involuntarily swallowed more often in the next minute than i had in my entire life.
I got complimented by a nurse for the clarity of the pictures they were able to get during an MRI. Didn't move my legs at all for 15 minutes...They literally told me not to move because it spoils the images. Dunno what they were expecting. Probably a tap-dancer.
After about 15 CT scans, 24+ chest xrays, MRIs, and basically every other form of medical imaging, you'll be happy to know you get used to it and even know what to do without instruction üòÇüòÖüòêüò•üò¢üò≠
Went for a mri scan the other day for a bulging disc. Hard to keep still at the best of times. They asked what music I would like to listen to and I said I‚Äôm happy with anything. Second song that came on had the chorus ‚ÄúI want to get my wet pussy licked‚Äù needless to say I couldn‚Äôt keep still from the laughter
I concur....but worse with MRI's. I've always had to do them for 45 minutes or so. Every 30 seconds feels like an hour. By the time they let you out, you start wondering what day it is.
I'm claustrophobic so CT's and MRI's are a nightmare for me. Had to have one after a wreck in 2018 and when the tech found out I was claustrophobic he checked on me frequently to make sure I was okay. Had to be the longest whatever time I ever experienced.
"Can confirm, cardiac MRI is the worst series of 30 seconds ever lol. I have to have one annually because of a congenital heart condition. The first time they put me in the tube and they couldn‚Äôt get the images without making me put my hands up over my head. Between that and the continuous series of breath holds, I came out saying ‚ÄúNope, never again‚Äù

Turns out the first time I was scheduled they forgot to give me the bigger bore MRI ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The breath holds, IV line, and having a metal thing on your chest the entire time are unpleasant, but at least I can lay flat."
Glad im not the only one lol. Got a CT scan for the first time the other day and i found it incredibly unnerving
I came here with a different answer but upon reading this ... You are too right . Especially if you are in pain .
Same with the ultrasound of your heart, they have thing up in your rib cage, you‚Äôre on your side, inhale and hold your breath, not even 30 seconds but feels like forever.
I've had shots into my eardrum where they tell you to be perfectly still.   I know people that have had to have shots into their eye, I imagine that would be even worse.
"I fall asleep during medical tests like this. I just can‚Äôt stay awake. 

Airplanes do it too. I think it‚Äôs something about the white noise and the staying still. I usually shut my eyes to help me stay still, and then I wake up when it‚Äôs over."
For me, it was PET scans. When they'd inject the sugar and have to wait, I'd lose track of time. And THEN the scan took forever. And you had to wait afterward to make sure the images are clear...
Not a CT. But when I was in boot camp I was taken to the VA for a bone scan. I had to lay still for maybe a few mins but it was the most glorious few mins for my sleep deprived recruit life.
I was having a brain MRI and they told me to not move my eyes for 45 minutes because they were scanning my optic nerves. Try not moving your eyes for a few seconds.
I think you mean MRIs. CTs are fairly quick; MRIs are the ones that make you hold still for forever. I'm supposed to have one soon and I'm dreading it... not because I'm claustrophobic or anything, but I have ADD and trying not to fidget for that long sounds like hell. And *thinking* about how I can't fidget just makes the urge to fidget even worse. Not to mention everything else that could go wrong... like, I have allergies, so what if I sneeze and they have to start the scan all over? Or if my nose starts running -- do I have to just let it drip down my face for the next 45 minutes? Because ewww.
I'm claustrophobic so CT's and MRI's are a nightmare for me. Had to have one after a wreck in 2018 and when the tech found out I was claustrophobic he checked on me frequently to make sure I was okay.
Yup, but MRI and nuclear scans have that beat.  I had a nuke scan that took 2 hours.  By the end of it, my shoulders, hips, and back were completely numb.  Had to be helped up then told to rest on my side for an hour.  Got a call the next day, results were wonky.  Had to go redo the scan. Ughhh
I think it‚Äôs called MR. and it‚Äôs basically the same thing just that it took 2 hours (some technical differences idk) and I took one of my head as a 12 year old. I knew I could never stay still when I was sleeping so I tried to not move a muscle for 2 hours. It felt like a sad backstory arc representing my whole upgrowing
You need to add frantically deciding if you should take your phone or not because you'll probably be awhile in there.
"
This was me, a couple days ago!  Here's the extra difficulty in my case. I'm wheelchair-bound (fuck you MS).  On a more fortuitous occasion, I don't have any trouble going to the bathroom by myself. When I wake up in the middle of the night, and every muscle in my body is stiff as a board it is DEFINITELY NOT a fortuitous occasion and I have to wake up my wife to help.  Sorry to wake you baby. It's definitely better than the alternative..."
There's the precursor moment where you stand up out of bed and have to stand still a moment for your bowels to give you one last moment of strength before you shit yourself and you just stand there hoping to everything that it all stays put but you don't dare move for the next 10 seconds or you absolutely will end up painting a Jackson Pollock down half the hallway.
"I'll countersuggest the moment directly after your special starfish has stopped dry heaving after multiple agonizing minutes, and you sit there in silence, the residual pain still throbbing through your colon, waiting for your bowels to tell you if you're safe... or if there's more a-coming.

It's been over two years since that bad thai food gave me food poisoning, but I haven't forgotten."
"""I like you, harry...you're a regular guy...I want you to stay regular""

""Anally vomit"" reminded me of that scene. Great description."
The worst part is that somehow you were able to hold it in the entire time you slept but as soon as your eyes open you feel like you are about to shit on yourself if you don't run to the bathroom
it happened to me too many times and my stomach hurts harder than being stabbed, trust me feeling to eat a lot but your stomach progresses everything slower isn't funny, morale of this story, don't eat fast and too much or you can end up like me.
"This happened to me...in our very tiny 3 bedroom 1 bathroom...with my friend‚Äôs dad spending the night too...not a fun experience for me. 

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had food poisoning...but I imagine that‚Äôs what it would be like. But even worse."
Hey, fuck em!  If they sleep through the Suffering of the Anal Vomit while you‚Äôre roughing it out in there, then they aren‚Äôt friends and family to behind with
Imagine this, but living in a dorm and people keep asking me to wear a mask. I'm not gonna grab a mask if I'm about to shit myself lmao.
I sometimes run errands for my boss and I go to the self checkout line at the grocery store and ring all my shit up separately. A lot of times when I'm done with my boss's stuff, the 2nd person starts moving in and stands over me and then I start order #2. Luckily Covid has helped with this one.
Or trying to pay that automated parking machine and there‚Äôs 10 people behind you but you keep putting the card in the wrong way ... and at one point drop your card because you were so nervous
That feeling is too real. Especially when you have been in the situation of it being declined because it was always Russian roulette about the order things had hit your account so you often didn‚Äôt have money in there for a significant period of your life. Even worse when you‚Äôre a kid shopping with your mom and she already made you put back some things before you even got to check out and it‚Äôs still declined. Never wanted to melt into a floor more in my life than when watching my mom feel that way and knowing how hard she worked to take good care of us. PTSD man.
"If it makes you feel better generally it gives a reason for the decline. So it will say insufficient funds it that is the case.

Not always but when I worked as a cashier that was common."
"Which is so irrational because when have you ever even looked at what the person in front of you is doing? Because I'm definitely too distracted to care.

Mostly I feel judged by the cashier though."
I don't understand why cashiers aren't taught to hand the paper first, then the change at the end. What the fuck?
The chip in one of my card fails like half of the time. It  ant be pushed in too far or it will fail.
Im a cashier and let me tell you, I cringe when I have to ring up a 1.06 fountain drink or coffee and they hand me 2 dollars. Feels like it takes a year to grab all those coins.
Also - trying to get all the bags and groceries into the trolley after I've paid. The checkout attendant just stands there waiting to start scanning the next order and I feel like such a failure for not managing to get it all in the trolley before I had to stop and pay.
"In times like these there‚Äôs a line from Goodfellas that helps me be less stressed. 

‚ÄúPaulie moved slowly. But that‚Äôs only because Paulie didn‚Äôt have to move for anybody.‚Äù

Be Paulie."
I just realized I haven't felt that in a looooooong time. (the first one) man how times have changed.
As a cashier I can say that when there‚Äôs a big line, that thirty seconds last forever for us too, but when I see it happening I just tell myself that it just means I‚Äôm not the only person who can‚Äôt put money in my wallet.
When the chip decides it isn't gonna read today, but the machine still makes you try it 3 times before letting you just swipe it.
This is one of the reason I hate change, and pretty much never use cash again. Also tapping your card is the quickest and easiest thing in the world, and the quicker I can get out of social interactions with strangers, the better.

"That's extra fun when you have SNAP food benefits and EBT cash benefits. When you run the card for food payment first and it's not quite enough. But the employee doesn't know how to let you use what remains on the card so you can pay the difference with a debit card/cash.

I've had a couple of cashiers basically refuse to get help. They say money doesn't make people happy."
"There's no better feeling than casually taking as much time as needed to put it back in your wallet.  It's the biggest ""fuck you"" that you can say to your anxiety"
"What do you mean won't read in the debit machine? Don't you either use contactless or type in your PIN?

I'm pretty confused."
So the bank my husband and I are with is great (his dad works IT for the company) however I'd say at least once or twice a month, one of our cards with get cranky and spit out a bunch of random errors, but then we would use the other persons card which is attached to the same damn account and it would be just fine. I grew up poor as hell so its hella irritating to have to go through that when I DO have money lol
Thank you for reminding me my chip is worn out and I need to replace my debit card. I‚Äôm so sick of this feeling but I keep forgetting to do anything about it.
My card got declined twice in Ikea even though I knew I had money, it was super awkward having to hold up their long line for ages as I called home to make sure I was using the right pin, turned out it was a problem with the card reader and not my card when the next person after me also had that awkward moment.
I was a cashier when I was younger and running a card a couple times happens SO often its just annoying and I never thought more of it... people would very often appear embarrassed as if their transaction was bounced because it appeared they didn't have money, but I can't remember a single time they were not able to pay in the end anyway. I think its one of those things thats all in the perceivers head.
I work at a gas station/convenience store and I just wanna let you know it‚Äôs the machines because the same thing will happen to 90% of the customers I take care of on my shift. So if that‚Äôs happens just know you‚Äôre not the only that it does it to.
This is the best one, I can just feel the people behind me glaring at me as I try and get my change back in my wallet. I usually fumble the money to and get even more flustered.
It's worse when you get bills and a stack of coins on top, followed by the receipt handed out separately, then you have to pick up your bags and scram because they are already checking out the next person.
When i was in my teens and early 20s I did the  *shove it all in your pocket and figure it out later* ... now I'm in my mid thirties and I just put it in my wallet.. they can wait another 15 seconds.
"I pulled both of those yesterday.

Debit card didn't work after 3 tries, so I gave up and just handed them a $5 bill, before proceeding bro fumble putting the change in my wallet.

A very very long 30 seconds.

(I've been trying to use a debit card more bc of the change shortage)"
You gotta assert dominance by spit shining every coin while you stand there to one up the beta cucks behind you
"I totally relate to this but then I realized fuck em. They can wait an extra 5 seconds. 

The longest 30 seconds for me is being all in with a pocket pair vs two over cards in a poker tournament. It's a 50/50 spot, after paying an entry fee of $2500, playing 12 hours a day for 3 days, it all comes down to a coin flip. Each second feels like an eternity."
Oh god. When I got mine the doctor was tugging the string to make sure it was in the right place. The string snapped. So she had to get the duckbill thing and re-dilate me and put in a completely new one.
Exactly where my brain went, as well.  Though being Reddit, I didn't expect to see this answer. I just got a new one placed and he was having trouble getting it in the right spot.  Three attempts and 12 years later.... Phewf.
Oh man. ‚ÄúThis might hurt a little.‚Äù I have a high pain tolerance so I was surprised but I actually blacked out right after the doctor finished the insertion. And I‚Äôve had a kid so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve never experienced terrible uterine cramping, but that was unexpectedly awful. WTF?!
"I have bad gastro reflexes and when they did my IUD my uterus contracted and I farted. 

In the doctors face

Edit to add: I'm glad this story made peoples night. Now if only I could stop the notifications"
"Ugh. My doctor hadn't discussed the pain(or much of the process) with me, prior. So there I am, coochie out, asking ""is it...gonna hurt too much?"" And she just goes ""oh, it's GONNA HURT.""

You didn't feel like disclosing that with the 16 year old girl who was being forced to get one?

Also when it was over, I went to sit up and she went ""nonononono, lay back down. Don't want you fainting.""

My new doctor gets more and more mortified every time I tell her about my old one."
I told the doctor afterwards that that hurt worse than childbirth... She‚Äôs the only one in the office that doesn‚Äôt numb the area first :|
"Oh fuck...I got mine placed in this June. Dr. was like ""This will feel like a really bad cramp."" When she inserted it, I felt like my uterus has become a sashimi knife and started cutting everything. I was groaning in pain and she's like ""You have a really high pain tolerance"". That wasn't the worst part. For the next two weeks, I couldn't sit upright for too long because I would be in a constant state of cramping. At one point, I was in a meeting for maybe 30 mins and the cramping started. My colleagues took one look at my face and decided to end it early. My boss told me to work from home for the weeks following that because he was told that I couldn't walk out of the room without supporting myself against a wall. It was BAD!"
This. The worst pain of my life after the appointment I could barely stand up but my idiot ex boyfriend couldn‚Äôt find the building where he dropped me off 30 minutes ago?? So i walked around in 115 degree heat on the phone with him to help find me. Then got verbally abused because my directions weren‚Äôt clear! Cried the whole way home (: A few months later he makes me go in and get the strings shortened because he could feel them on his hyper sensitive dick i guess. Why I complied, no idea. The OBGYN shook her damn head when i went to get it out three years later. Good riddance to that man child.
Finally something I can relate to. I was told seconds beforehand that it was going to hurt - everyone else told me it didn't hurt at all. And man did that shit hurt. I know it's different for everyone, but I can say confidently it was the worst pain I've ever experienced. Worth it though!
Holy shit, I've got an appointment next week to get an IUD put in... I wasn't worried before and now I'm fucking panicking. Thanks Reddit.
Yes. I've had not one but TWO mirenas get stuck. The first one, 2 docs tried, while I was awake and not numbed. Ended up going to the surgical center to have it removed and replaced as an arm had gone thru my uterus. Can't happen twice, right?!?! Oh no. It can. I'm that lucky. Number 2, lost the strings. No biggie, small fishing expedition, can't be as bad as last time. It can. And was. She could grab it but not remove it without me coming off the table try, doc tapped out and wanted me to come back so the surgeon could try. I came back. She tried. And tried. I cried. And moaned. And hyperventilated. So she numbed me (not terrible but not fun) even after numbing, I was losing my shit. Got it out, and I must be insane because I got a 3rd one. Apparently I have a sensitive uterus üôÑ But hey, no periods for 5 more years, worth it, right?!?üò¨
As a 40 year old male, thank you. Read every response. This chat thread is very very informative. Women are amazing and beautiful. A woman has to go through a lot of uncomfortable hoops, responsible male only has to a put on a condom.
i‚Äôm a guy, i know an IUD is a type of birth control, but what exactly is it that you have to get it implanted, if you don‚Äôt mind answering?
The worst pain I‚Äôve ever had. I almost kicked my doctor‚Äôs face when she inserted it! It was completely involuntary, my body just reacted. Now I‚Äôm terrified of when I have to get it out.
"The doctor was on her residency and in training I guess you could say. She couldn't get it in...after 45 minutes. Kept putting it in a bit and then pulling it out because it ""wasn't right""...she had to get some older doctor to come and do it (with more force). The pain during and after was so bad, I ended up in the hospital that night to check if it had punctured the wall of my uterus. Swear to God, I'd rather cut off a finger than deal with getting an IUD inserted again."
I‚Äôm the idiot who agreed to let a MEDICAL STUDENT try and place my IUD. Took way more than 30 seconds of them poking around before the doctor stepped in.
I always thought I had a pretty high pain tolerance until I got my first IUD and cried the entire time. A very humbling experience.
Lol, I was absolutely in pain but I‚Äôm a trooper so I kept saying insisting it was okay. Then at the end I was like, ‚ÄúNo, it wasn‚Äôt that bad, but could you turn the lights back on?‚Äù The doctor hovered into my vision very concerned and goes, ‚Äú... They‚Äôre on.‚Äù That‚Äôs how I knew not to stand up or else I would faint. üòÇ
the worst part for me wasn't so much the insertion itself, but that my doctor didn't use any lube, only fucking water. can't imagine no other women complained about that to her.
The doctor had my cervix in those pliers and was trying to give me the anaesthetic injection before he put the coil in, but he couldn't get the injection to go in, suddenly the needle popped off the syringe up my hoo-ha, and all the liquid in the syringe shot out under pressure, bounced off my cervix, and hit him full in the face. I just said sorry because I didn't know what to say :/
My doctor congratulated me for not fainting when she finished putting mine in. Apparently a lot of people do?
I really appreciate all these comments. The last time I went to my doctor regarding contraception she was trying so hard to pressure me into having the coil. I said I wasn‚Äôt interested as I‚Äôve heard so many horror stories, and friends have always said bad things about them. She kept brushing me off and saying how much she loved hers, whilst laughing at my concerns. I‚Äôm sorry you all here had to go through the pain, but it‚Äôs reassured me to stand up to her again next time!
My IUD insertion was easily the most intense pain I've ever experienced in my life - both times I've had it done. The pain didn't last long, but I've never felt anything quite like that before. I can't believe I didn't pass out.
Hey, male provider here.. I dread giving these to patients. Anything tips on what I can do to make the experience less awful?
My fianc√© just got one inserted and it seemed more like a week of agony! And now, just when it started feeling better, it fucked up her pH level and gave her BV ‚Äî and then the meds for that gave her a yeast infection. Hopefully this ends up being worthwhile for us lmao!
"Oof, yes. Just had one removed and a new one placed last week. My partner was like ""your eyes got really big for about 30 seconds."" Yeah, that's the face of internal yelling."
god, yes. my friend got an IUD and had no pain at all, just a light pressure feeling. my sister said she felt a small pinch. got mine, absolutely awful pain inserting and cramps from hell for the rest of the day.
Reading all of the threads that came off this comment was a mistake. It genuinely makes me feel sick and dizzy reading about IUDs. Hate being on hormonal contraceptives but I shall stick to it. Also I've had horrible horrible periods in the past & family history of endo so it's a no from me!
"I've never had one of those, but I did have one of those little balloon thingies shoved into me during childbirth to help speed dilation along. Worst pain I've been experienced in my life. I almost passed out. 

Why is this sort of stuff so awful?"
Oh god. So I got mine put in, and it was horrible obviously. But less than a month later I accidentally pulled that one out of me and had to go get it redone. It was all a very traumatizing experience. I didn‚Äôt even want to have sex for like two months because the thought of something going back up there was too much
Male here. My God, you women are strong. We men, or at least most of us can't even imagine things like that done. Way to go ladies, you're the real MVP's when it comes to birth control. We can either slap on some Trojan Magnum XL condoms or get a snip
Ah God I had a panic attack when she attempted to remove mine, I was very much anticipating nausea-inducing pain.
I had no idea what to expect when I got it put in, the measuring of the uterus was the absolute worst! Before when I‚Äôd go to the gyno it was like ehh they will have me like this for just a few seconds, just breathe, no biggie. I went last week for a pap and swear I had a little ptsd from the when I got the iud put in earlier this year.
(If this helps someone I‚Äôm happy). I had my Copper IUD fitted last year. It hardly hurt and I think it‚Äôs because I had sex just before the appointment. The doctor said I was really dilated and it was super quick.
"Dude. I‚Äôm not even going to read the other comments in this post because yours is spot on. After they inserted mine my glasses were completely fogged from the heat coming off me. I was sweating and my whole body was beet red. It took me at least 30 minutes and 3 cups of OJ to sit up. 

And now I have to get it taken out and replaced next week üò≠üò≠üò≠"
I remember sitting in the waiting room before I got mine, reading a friend‚Äôs Facebook post asking about IUDs and everyone‚Äôs comments saying they barfed/passed out/laid in bed for days. I had driven myself to the doctor and just took a couple aleve and figured no big deal. And I did end up fine, but it was for real the worst pain I have ever experienced. Oh and apparently my uterus is tilted, so it took a couple minutes of tinkering to make sure it was placed correctly.
"Yep. And getting your cervix scraped. 

Waiting for a man to come in and be like ‚ÄúbUt ItS nOt As BaD aS...‚Äù just shut the fuck up please. Come back when you squeeze a watermelon out of your penis hole"
My male ob/gyn tries to talk me into one and I was like well I‚Äôve heard they can be very painful to place. He says oh no, no pain. I looked him in the eyes and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôve never had one though.‚Äù He says ‚Äúwell no but I‚Äôve placed hundreds.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve never had one?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell...No.‚Äù Ok then, I think I‚Äôll pass thanks.
Am I the only person here who just got general anesthesia, without even having to ask for it? They just put me under, I woke up, keened from the pain for a bit, got a painkiller, then my friend picked me up and drove me home. Birth control should be as painless as possible and easily accessible for everyone who wants/ needs it.
"I read a bunch of responses to this thread, I've had two IUDs (one hormone, and currently copper) and had not pleasant experiences, I ended up having what I think was a panic attack even just reading other people's stories. I had to sit down for probably like 15 minutes or so in my bathroom while my bf made sure I was okay, overheating and sweating everywhere, extremely light headed, and trying to focus on coming back to reality and not passing out.

The first time wasn't too bad, I have anxiety anyways so I asked my doctor for benzos to help. I felt gross afterwards but bearable. I ended up throwing up after (in the subway drive thru yay) leaving the doctor's office, had to get my bf to pull over. This was a hormone one so I had to get it replaced 3 years later, the replacement was so much worse. Same deal, got Ativan/lorazepam to help with the anxiety. I ended up passing out while getting it taken out, the doctor didn't feel comfortable putting the new one so we rescheduled for another date. I had to sit for a bit to make sure I was okay. I honestly can't remember actually getting the IUD put in right now, I think I had taken enough ativan to forget lol.

All in all, I don't ever regret getting an IUD. It wasn't the best experience but reading other people's experiences it gets worse the more you get. It makes me worry for the future for my birth control options as I don't think many doctors are going to be open to putting people under for a fairly simple procedure. I don't think (if) any doctors are going to help a younger than 30 year old, unmarried woman with figuring out birth control for someone who doesn't want children."
"The story I am told is that when I was a baby my dad set me on the bed to just kinda hang out. It was a water bed though, so when he got on the other side the tsunami threw me on the ground (landed on my back luckily)  
Dad says it felt like an eternity going from me making the ""I'm about to scream"" face to me actually screaming"
Likewise, as a pediatric resident who attends complicated high-risk deliveries in case resuscitation is needed, the seconds between the delivery and when the baby cries are terrifying.
When a little kid falls, always laugh and make a joke of it. They will only cry if they are either genuinely hurt or you make a face or sound that is negative.
That silent, open mouth, eyes squinched, calm before the storm. If it‚Äôs longer than 5 seconds I assume they‚Äôre either fine or out cold.
My cousin was and is a jumper. So when he was a baby. If you picked him up, put him down or whatever he would do his fucking best to jump out of your arms, or off the bed, or out of his crib whatever. Thank god kids bounce and don‚Äôt damage easily because that little mother fucker loved jumping from high places. It‚Äôs a blood miracle he didn‚Äôt crack his head. But it‚Äôs just a matter of time. He is 11 now and has broken his legs 3 times. Ankles, shins, and tail bone. Stupid fuck just likes jumping.
In my experience, when my kids got hurt, they first let out a warm-up scream and then paused before letting out the truly blood-cuddling cry. You could tell how bad they were hurt by how long the gap was between the warm-up and the true scream - the longer the gap was, the more it hurt. You didn‚Äôt need the 1-10 scar like hospitals used for pain; for every second, you added to the pain meter, so if you got to ten-Mississippi, that kid was in a world of hurt.
"Ugh - the memories. Though it happened 5 years ago now, the memory is crystal clear. I was in bed at 7am on a Saturday morning, just about waking up. I hear the kids playing in the living room. My husband was out there as well and cooking breakfast. All of a sudden I hear a crash and a thud, and then nothing. It was probably just a few seconds, but it felt like hours. Then the blood-curdling SCREAMS started, I hopped out of bed so fast and raced into the living room at a speed that would have left Usain Bolt in the dust.

My son had tripped over his own feet and smacked chin first into a wooden chair. His teeth went *through his face* (the area under his bottom lip) and there was, quite literally, a hole in his face and a good amount of blood/swelling. We really couldn't tell how bad the damage was. I called my sister who rushed over to watch my other so while we dashed off the the ER.

Fifteen stitches and several dentist visits later, he was OK. All he has to show for it is an unnoticeable scar under his lip. Baby teeth came through unscathed, but not a good day in our house."
"30 seconds of fall time, assuming it wasn't accelerated by any other means than gravity that is 4,410 m. I assume the force of impact doesn't allow for crying. 

Although at some point the friction of our atmosphere and the lack of aerodynamics of a big headed baby, would slow the rate of acceleration meaning less distance traveled in the 30 seconds.

To be honest I cheated the math... Sorry if it's not right.

"I was told by someone that this behaviour come from a long time ago. I you fall while in the wild, you don't want to bait predators. So you look, and if you see a ""protector"", you tell him you just fell and are in pain"
Not gonna lie, I took this as a joke meaning the baby fell for a whole 30 seconds. Like. Off a building.
Recently I've read somewhere that in adults when you hit your pinky on the table leg it takes over a second for pain to get to brain because it travels with slow unmyelinated nerves so the speed with speed of travel of 1m/s, so if you are 2m tall it would take two seconds. This makes me think that those nerves are even slower for babies so it takes longer for pain to reach the brain
"When I was at uni I was sharing a house with 4 other, one of whom always had loads of friends over almost every weekend and we'd all go out partying or whatever.

I remember one morning waking up with a horrible hangover and I really needed a poop but I've always been a very self conscious pooper and my housemate who had 2 or 3 of her friends staying over had the bedroom right next to the bathroom.

For about 20 minutes I was sat on my bed, desperately trying to hold in a metric shit tonne of shit while listening to them all debate when they were going to go out to get food. When they finally left I run upstairs and completely decimated that poor porcelain."
Once I did the leg cross squeeze outside a one toilet unisex toilet in a gas station. I knocked. Stayed patient, but when I did the leg cross squeeze an employee banged on the door and eventually yelled a pregnant lady had to pee. I was not pregnant, but I lowered my hands to my belly and watched a poor homeless man who destroyed the bathroom come out with his head hung low. I felt so bad for him but I had to pee so bad I didn‚Äôt even care I was hovering over a shit smeared toilet. To the homeless man‚Äôs credit it did appear he was trying to clean it up.
Maybe even worse is being the one in the bathroom knowing someone is standing right outside the door waiting to get in.
It's not quite 30 seconds, but as a guy, that rummage around looking for the way into my trunks pocket... before I realize I'm wearing underwear without a pocket. Worse than running out of air underwater.
Was at one of those park bathrooms yesterday with two single use rooms. One was a lady and her kid, her son was waiting to be next. The other you could hear a woman and several kids, and at one point in my trying desperately to hold my pee, I realized she was on the phone in there. You could hear somebody on speaker. They were in there when I arrived, and still in there after the son went, and still in there after I went. It must‚Äôve been a good ten or fifteen minutes they were in there. I know it‚Äôs difficult with multiple kids especially if there‚Äôs diapers involved and no changing table, but full bladder me was not happy.
I do janitorial at a car dealership and omg waiting for everyone in the men‚Äôs bathroom to get the hell out so I can clean tests the hell out of my patience. If someone‚Äôs in there I‚Äôll go and grab the trash around the dealership, go back to check, nope someone taking a shit, I‚Äôll go and clean some offices, come back, ALWAYS someone shitting lol
Oh God yes! I remember I was on my way home to PA from Baltimore, after eating at the Bubba Gump Shrimp there in the harbor. (Bad idea), and then walking around in the hot sun doing the ship tour while it curdled in my stomach (Worse idea). Stopped at a gas station and there was a line. The family in front of me was big (Mexican, I think, and didn't speak english, at least not that I heard). And I'm sweating, and panicking. I'm not gonna make it. Im thinking about being the asshole and just cutting them all when the door opened. But the mother, probably sensing my panic, waived me ahead of them. God Bless that family. I hope good things happen to them!
"Lol im literally in that situation rn. I feel like the guy just discovered he can get paid for sitting on the toilet since its the same pair of shoes from 2 hours ealier when i decided ""nah i can wait until later"""
The best thing about moving from an apartment into a house is that I now have two bathrooms. Having to share just one with my husband was torture.
"I remember visiting Central Park after eating breakfast and I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass myself in front of my ex‚Äôs older brother whom we were visiting. As soon as he left I had about 5 minutes til my colon exploded.

The only bathroom I could find took me a little bit to travel to while limping and clutching my stomach. When I got there the one stall was being used, and I pleaded to the guy to let me use the bathroom. He must‚Äôve been on his phone because he came out and saved my entire day trip to New York. I didn‚Äôt pack an extra pair of boxers and home was a 6 hour bus ride away."
I've actually timed my washing machine and it is around 4 minutes. Not sure why it always says 30 sec.
"My mother in-laws washing machine is the WORST for that. Start a load, says it'll be 40 minutes. Come back in 40 minutes and there's 20 minutes left. 20 minutes later there's 5 left 5 later there's still 5 fuckin minutes. 5 later? Now it's like ""final spin"" or whatever with no eta. Gahhhhh. 


My washer just plays a jaunty lil tune when it's done, so I don't bother checking."
Look at the fat cat over here with a digital display instead of just staring at the knob wondering how long each dash mark on the dial takes.
it‚Äôs 30 seconds until it finishes that part of the washing sequence, cause there‚Äôs different parts to it
"This is so bad with mine that my wife and I joke that our Samsung washer and dryer are in ""Korean minutes""."
I had a machine say there was five minutes left, so I decided to wait for it. It took 12. I never used that machine again.
Anyone else get pissed off with modern sensory laundry machines?  Just do what I tell you to do iv been washing my own laundry since I was 12, fuck your sensor im trying to soak whites!
"My dryer will say ""15 minutes"" then ill check it 10 minutes later, no lie, and it'll say ""20 minutes"" all the new smart shit is trash."
When you have to pay for the washing machine, 30 secs is like 10 secs and your clothes are still foamy.
Bro, it's the same with the microwave one minuet will pass and when I go to look at it another 5 got added somehow
Look at mr fancy pants with a washer that shows time remaining... My washing machine has a dial that seemingly never moves if you watch it... No matter how long. Then once you've given up all hope and it is forgotten, you're startled by the sports arena style buzzer that jarringly goes off for 5 seconds long than is necessary rivaling that of a departing cruise ship.
It's interesting how now I can't stand a 5 second ad on youtube, and when I was a kid it was normal to watch 10 minutes of ads every 20 minutes of tv programming.
"YouTube is getting steadily worse. 

If they did (what they are currently on) 6 months ago (20 second ads, some skippable 5 second ones) then everyone would get pissed off and not watch the videos.

But now they‚Äôre incrementally getting longer and longer, unskippable, and more obnoxious. 

I fucking refuse to pay ¬£20 a month for YouTube so you can keep pushing, arseholes. This lady isn‚Äôt for turning."
"use youtube vanced if you're on android, basically youtube premium (no ads + you can play videos with the app not open) 

just gotta download the .apk from google."
You can actually skip any YouTube ad by clicking the teeny tiny little ‚Äúi‚Äù at the bottom left of the video
If I have to watch another Trump ad on YouTube, I'm going to lose it. They do NOT know their demographic.
Ad man here. I tell every client that any video over 6 seconds just pisses people off. Slowly but surely eradicating the non-skip 30s preroll
Is it insane I will not click a video and just watch the whole thing small and just with subtitles to avoid ads?
You can skip it by pressing on that {i} icon on the bottom left. Just state that the ad is irrelevant and it would skip it right away
LPT on this, most ads on youtube have a little info icon, if you click on it and say you don't want to see that ad anymore it will skip the rest of the ad.  You'll still see that ad again eventually, but you can now skip unskippable ads.
If you're using Chrome, install the extension ublock origin. It automatically blocks webpage and video ads and trackers.
YouTube Premium is kinda expensive, but if you watch YouTube as much as I do it's *totally* worth it.
Sure, skip this ad, just like you skipped out on buying Amazon stock, and Google and Apple... need I go on?
If you select the little ‚Äúi‚Äù icon with the circle around it, and hit ‚Äústop seeing this add‚Äù then it will disappear
I feel like those unskippable ads keep getting longer, or there are fewer ones that can be skipped after 5 seconds.. but for me me, if I see a 5 second ad it‚Äôs keeping me there 5 seconds I‚Äôll wait it out. If I have to wait 10 seconds, I‚Äôm zoning out and opening another tab. If it‚Äôs 30 seconds it‚Äôs an immediate close or if I really want to see the video I‚Äôd sooner take 2 minutes to get up and go get my phone from the other room than sit there for 30 seconds watching an ad. The longer it is the less likely I am to have any idea what the heck you just tried to force on me
I was once watching Overwatch League on Twitch (a vod I think) and due to some bug when a ad came up it put the whole vod I was watching as the unskippable ad. A five hour unskippable ad.
I remember once back in like 2009 when YouTube was a very different place I got this ‚Äúad‚Äù that was just a brief stop-motion remake of Jurassic Park. It was like 5 minutes long and I couldn‚Äôt skip it. In hindsight I should have just refreshed the page or something but I was in like 2nd grade at the time so of course I didn‚Äôt think of that.
"It is still skippable tho. Look for the ! symbol next to the ads timer. Then click it and choose something that say ""i dont want to see this ads"" and then pick one of those 3 choice. You need to turn on personalized ads first or else it wont works. Took only 5 seconds to skip 'unskippable' ads"
I actually prefer the day and age when all ads were unskippable and lasted a quarter of the time your show was. Not saying I like the ads, however, just.. . That.... Umm.... That.... I'm a crotchety old man.. I guess.
I usually just leave the video then open it again because youtube usually gives different ads that you may be able to skip or no ad at all
"Pro tip for YT on phone:  


When an ad shows up just close and open up the video again  

Sometimes you have to do it more than 3 times but it works"
Especially now as a teacher, when I want to show youtube videos. The kids are all sitting there quietly and expectantly and I'm just sighing waiting for this stupid ad to go away so I can actually show them the cool thing I wanted to show them.
Haha I was gonna say editing a 30 second ad and having to watch it over and over, that 30 seconds gets longer and longer every time
Crazy to think that when I was a kid, I‚Äôd watch five minutes of ads just for 10 minutes of tv, and then another five minutes for the second half of the episode.
We are constantly being asked for 30 seconds of our time.  Every waking hour, it seems we have to wait for something that inserts itself into our schedule and robs us of just a small enough time that we just accept it.  Imagine all the time lost.  Not just ads either.  Answering robocalls, waiting for crosswalk signals that are always on, self-service checkouts that require an associate to verify a purchase...  Technology should free up our time, not introduce interruptions.
Click the (i) icon on the bottom left, and say stop seeing this ad. Then it‚Äôll prompt you to give a reason as to why you want to. Click any of them and press ok.
"Another redditor provided a good mental tactic for this that I use. Whenever you really have to go to the bathroom in public and are searching for a bathroom, just mentally assume that once you find one it‚Äôll be occupied and this ‚Äúmental trick‚Äù will prevent your brain from immediately wanting that ‚Äúrelease‚Äù the moment you arrive at the locked door. 

Doesn‚Äôt help being locked in a bathroom though.  For that, all faucet water in America is potable (unless otherwise stated) and you can survive about three weeks without food."
The 30 seconds after you try flushing a massive log in a public bathroom and there are people waiting to use the bathroom and you're just watching the log swirl, and swirl... will it make it? Will it flush? Is this how I die??
I was stuck for much more than 30 seconds. More like 10 minutes. I was at my grandmother's house. Luckily she came upstairs and let me out. I forgot to tell my dad though. He got stuck behind the same door and had to break it down.
Or the 30 seconds you need to hold your breath after entering the only free cubicle that someone vacated seconds before. Where they clearly have just rid their souls of rotten intestinal goop and dead matter. Where you will yourself to pee quicker than your muscles allow. Praying that your natural breathing responses don't kick in...
Most bathroom door (at least in my country) are designed to be unlocked from the outside with a butter knife
"Woah... right as I read that, I looked up from my phone and watched this situation happen in the restaurant I‚Äôm at. 

matrixglitch.gif"
Bruh I got a serious phobia after I got stuck in my friends bathroom and I had to spend 5 minutes kicking down the door
"yo i did this and my gag reflex was so bad i started crying and retching at the same time

then i let out the largest burp i've ever had and it echoed throughout the entire office lmao"
Holy shit this is exactly what came to mind when I read the post. The way it feels like it‚Äôs gonna slide down your throat. *Fuck that shit.*
The single most disgusting flavor I‚Äôve ever tasted. You know when Spongebob tastes snail-po and his tongue shrivels up? That‚Äôs how I felt
Sorry to tell you that now there's 3D imaging software that eliminates the need for those nasty alginate impressions. It's just a little camera and takes like 2-3 minutes. Kids these days won't know the struggle
I remember when I did this I couldn‚Äôt stop gagging and the old lady dentist got mad and yelled at me :(
dude i freaked out lmao. it covered a lot of the back of my mouth so i couldn't breathe and it was so scary
Am I the only one that didn't think it was that bad? People on reddit keep talking about it so I thought it was gonna be awful, but it was ok.
I‚Äôm so confused. I got braces on my top row two months ago and I didn‚Äôt have any goo or trays in my mouth at any point.
"In a similar vein, the fluoride rinse at the end of a dentist visit.  Supposed to be 60 seconds, feels like an hour and you end up gagging for the rest of the day.

So glad I have the choice of fluoride paint now."
This was my first thought as well; the paste went all the way back and I made the most awful noise, somewhere between a gag and a heave. Then it leaves that papery residue behind when it's over.
"I had to get an impression done recently for a night guard (hooray for anxiety-ridden teeth grinding!). My dentist said, ""If you feel like you might gag, tuck your chin and look down."" Worked for me!"
I worked as a dental nurse for a few years. We found if you focus on wiggling your toes and breathing through your nose its not as bad. Takes your mind off it
"the trick is to stay as calm as possible and do exactly what they tell you to, breath steadily through the nose.  
In and Out. In and Out.

I absolutely fucking hated these. and I had to do them so often. it was awful  
but at some point it clicked, and since then they were still bad (obviously) but it was much better"
"It's also not nice being the one taking the impression (that's the goey stuff) and watching your patient gag their eyes out because of YOU üòê.

Source: I'm a dental student."
"For me it was when they pull the braces off and sand down your teeth to make that all nice and even. 

I‚Äôve never experienced so much pain as the pain of a spinning sanders on my teeth."
I was just fitted for a night mouth guard to help with bruxism. My TMJ has been awful, so the time spent with my mouth open wide with the goo disks in my mouth was AGONY. The worst part is they had to redo the top one 3 times because they kept fucking it up. My jaw can barely open wide enough to eat a burger, and even then it hurts. So yeah. No bueno.
They actually don‚Äôt do this anymore. When I went, they scanned my teeth and made a computer model instead
Omg I was fully expecting to have to write this one. Time stands still when this is happening, it is the worst
You just brought up repressed memories of me gagging on that shit and accidentally spitting it right into the face of the dental assistant. Thanks for that.
When i had this i had a blocked nose and all they kept saying was breath through  your nose , like yeh id be doing that instead of choking and gagging if i could
I would give this an award if i had coins. I have had braces for about 5 years (I just had them removed like 2 weeks ago) and not only the gooey stuff is annoying, they put a lot of shit into my mouth. One time they had this thing that kept my mouth entirely open which made it basically impossible to swallow. I always make too much saliva with these things in my mouth and keep feeling like I have to swallow. Then this lady asks me ‚ÄòCan you please hold your mouth still and stop swallowing‚Äô, which makes it even worse. Same effect when dentists or orthodontists ask you to calm down after doing something insanely painful
For a lot of things we use digital scans now. Look for a dentist that had an intraoral scanner. Didn't work for everything but I use one for probably 2/3 of impressions now
Oh shit, forgot entirely about this sensation. And how it feels when they pry the mold off. I remember my ortho said ‚Äúit‚Äôs made from seaweed...‚Äù
I feel you man, went to dentist today and for the procedure applied the stuff and that 30 secs were like an hour for me.
My dad went to the dentist a couple days ago, and instead of that, they just did some sort of scan with a camera
I had to do this the first time I had braces and honestly it wasn‚Äôt bad imo. I had to get braces again due to my original orthodontist effing up my jaw and they make retainers using 3D technology now.
This stuff was legit the worst. My gag reflex is so bad that I actually 'accidentally' bit my orthodontist because I really struggled with it
And the fastest 30 seconds is when the put that numbing goo on a long ass stick and put it in the place before you‚Äôre about to get a shot at the dentist.
">That gooey stuff they put in your mouth

It's not actually that bad. I'm 25 (almost 26) and I had braces when I was around 14/15 and the putty that they use wasn't actually that bad. I'm one of the lucky ones who only had braces in for around 8 months because even though my teeth looked bad, they obviously weren't.

I was also told by other kids at school that braces hurt like hell and I very quickly learned that this wasn't the case for me. I only felt some slight pain for around 3 hours or so after having them put in and even then the pain wasn't that bad. Even when I needed them adjusting at my next appointment they only gave me a slight weird sensation/pain for maybe just a couple of hours."
Oh my God it's been 27 years since I had braces and I could still feel it and smell it when I read this comment. I thought they'd have better technology and be able to make a mold of your teeth with a scanner or something by now. Is it still like band-aid colored silly putty and makes a horrible slurpy suction sound when they pull it off?
Never had braces, but one of my worst experiences ever was when I was having issues with my wisdom teeth and they had to shove those xray things as far back into my jaw as they could go. It felt like literal torture holding that thing in place, while unable to move my mouth in any way. I had tears streaming down my face from the pain.
I‚Äôve always wondered about this because I have a bad gag reflex yet this gooey thing never bothered me.
Ive just had my brace fitting delayed, but they figure it out with a scanner now (in the uk at least) so we get off easy these days
My gag reflex was soo bad that I actually tree up and I had to come back another time to do it again. Luckily I didn't throw up again
As someone whose gag reflex is so bad that I almost throw up every time I brush my teeth, that surprisingly was not that hard to do
Also, when you are getting X-rays done and they put the razor blade film in your mouth. I swear they sharpen the edges of the plastic to slice into your gums.
Man.... I've only felt this a handful of times but it really does feel like you're stuck in a timeless purgatory when you're debating which path you're going to take. The worst part is even when you make it to the morning, you can feel that a part of you still died inside that night.
"At one point in my life (a long time ago) I literally had the barrel of my gun in my mouth with my thumb on the trigger. Out of nowhere my friend called me and I was like ‚Äúshit well I guess I should answer at least‚Äù - he wanted to know if I wanted to go out later that night because he was having a bad day. I was like ‚Äúyeah sure!‚Äù and it didn‚Äôt hit me about what I was about to do until I hung up. To this day he probably doesn‚Äôt know he saved my life on complete accident.

And I know that sounds ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù but I was staring at that gun for like two hours. A few shots of Scotch later and I was like ‚Äúnope I‚Äôm going to do it!‚Äù and then my phone went off."
As someone with multiple attempts and having talked two of my friends out of it, I can confirm that it feels like the world is closing in on you and your mind just can't have a sane thought process. Goodluck to you, fellow redditor. (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*.‚úß
Wow, I'm really sorry you experience this, you are a very strong person, please take brakes and look after yourself aswell. I can't imagine how difficult your job is.
"Only reason most people don't do it is cuz of their family (whatever is left of it), they start hoping for natural death. It's a hopeless situation where the mind and spirit have given up with the former running on autopilot. It's one of the worst kind of pain.

Those who feel even if it's just an inkling of being depressive, get help."
From one crisis worker to another, thank you for what you do. The work we do is so difficult and every second of those conversations is crucial.
Yeah, the entirety of Hamlet's Act 3 Scene 1 soliloquy goes through your head in 30 seconds, it's fucking terrifying
I've never read a reddit post that gave me goose bumps, but this one would be it.. I remember being there myself. In that minute or so where the method was right there in front of me. Time feels almost thick..
Thank you for your work. I work with crisis counselors as an intake worker. So I transfer the calls, and its def stressful waiting to connect them, but I cant imagine actually being the crisis counselor. How do you selfcare?
"It's funny how greatly moments can differ in that way, so often time feels long, meandering and monotonous, but it only takes a few for things to change drastically. 

One moment, someone's alive, the next, they aren't. It's as simple and factual as that, but it's difficult trying to comprehend sometimes, how it happens, what could've been if it didn't, it happening of their own accord makes it a million times more conflicting in every way, but at the same time, none of them. 

It's weird, life goes by that quick, and yet it feels like it drags on each day without any real purpose. Just going through the motions, it's hard trying to make more of it all."
Thank you very helping those with suicidal desires get through it. I believe if my brother would have someone like you he wouldn't have done it. I am always struggling with wanting to end my life. I would have peace but I know that it would be awful on those I love. Especially my kids and husband. Thanks for your hard work.
This is why if I ever buy I gun, I plan to give my gun cabinet a very long or inconvenient password. If it takes 1 minute to open that case, even in the worst of times that would be enough.
Thats so sad, I wish there was a proper counseling service people could go through to commit suicide, having no one to talk to and having to do it by yourself must be pretty harsh.
"I was thinking about commenting something like this but from the other person's perspective but I didn't know how it would be received. I don't know if it was the moments before deciding to do it that were longer or the time after I laid down trying to fall asleep knowing what I had just done.

One thing I learned after everything was over was that for many people ""their first current thought of suicide occurred within 10 minutes or less of their attempt"" (from my therapy book referencing a study). So if you find yourself in this situation and you can do nothing else, wait. Give yourself half an hour."

"Or getting the ""hey can we talk"" or ""hey can I ask you something"" text and replying yes and waiting for them to reply with the answer... Makes you think back to ever wrong thing you've ever done."
I asked my girlfriend what she was doing when a situation like that happened(before we started dating), she said that she was freaking out over what I said and kept deleting what she wrote because she was scared of fucking up.
If I do that, for some reason I think putting it on do not disturb is a good idea. Or I'll hide the notifications so they don't pop up. But then I end up checking anyway. So who knows.
My ex did that when she was typing out the breakup text for 2 hours straight. pretty fun way of being dumped. I wish it was 30 seconds but it was two hours. Damn, your comment sent me down a memory lane oof

Disable typing notification. Takes away that ambiguity and angst associated with hyperconnectivity and replaces it with the traditional ‚Äúit went, maybe they got it, maybe not. Maybe they are on a boat somewhere.‚Äù Brain handles emotion better when it doesn‚Äôt have to process in real time. These dumb apps abuse human psychology.
I really wish there was an option to turn that off like read receipts. It causes nothing but trouble. There‚Äôs really no benefit. Half the time it‚Äôs just someone accidentally hit Space or a random letter, which has happened to me before. Then you get an angry message asking about what essay I‚Äôm writing, and then I‚Äôm confused.
I just did this. But there as no blip after. Also I think your focusing on relationship/romance. Mines a business thing....not a postive one. Pretty sure I'm out a shit load of money and my remodel isn't getting done. Fucking asshole.

So on a Friday afternoon during a rapid text exchange I texted ‚ÄúDo you want to go out tonight?‚Äù  ... ... crickets ... weird bc we‚Äôd already discussed this as a good idea. So I check my phone to see if I‚Äôd sent it. I had sent it. Though I‚Äôd accidentally texted her ‚ÄúDo you want to in out tonight?‚Äù  

I quickly sent a clarification and apology. She was grateful for the follow up bc she wasn‚Äôt sure what I meant... 

We did go out that night and dated for a while, we are still friends (on FB), and yes, during our dating spell, we did ‚Äúin out‚Äù.

There are probably so many messages I shouldn‚Äôt have sent to bears, so many that could have been perceived as just strange, or some that may have been even inappropriate. But of course the very first thing to consider is the fact that I really only trust females for the most part because by in large almost every male friend I have had has betrayed. There is also the part to consider that much of the messages I think back and say? Could that be weird? Came probably at times of extreme stress and so forth because undoubtedly the things that have been done to me by these degenerates have been brutal, so of course had you gone through what I have you may understand. There is also the fact that I was just like I‚Äôm going to just approach this like it‚Äôs also my real diary so that they can get an insight into how/what I think exactly as it is so there‚Äôs no ugh... room for not knowing exactly how I am for reasons/in attempt to be virtuous.  Etc etc etc. but I feel like most of the ones that I was like ohh shit I shouldn‚Äôt have said that was like swearing ohh snap I can‚Äôt pollute her fragile little mind, or just under ridiculous amounts of stress.

"My ex wife was horrible about this. I'd be at work at like 3 PM and she'd text me that then just yeet her phone into a black hole or something. I'd be sweating bullets the rest of the day only to come home and find out that what we needed to talk about was how I keep buying creamy Caesar dressing when she wants regular Caesar dressing.

I had to sit her down several times and explain to her that she cannot text me that anymore for any reason."
My first girlfriend hit me with that, but then said that we should talk in 3 days. So I was sitting in the anxiety for 3 whole days. Plus, in that time we went to a grad party, so it wasn't like we weren't gunna see each other for 3 days. She just didn't wanna break up with me before our friend's party.
"My boss recently sent me ""I need to speak with you ASAP."" He then came into my office before I could even reply to tell me he'd just gotten out of a meeting where a notoriously unpleasant coworker had given me glowing reviews during a meeting he had just had. He was very proud of himself for making my blood pressure skyrocket for 30 seconds there."
"Oh, me principal used to send emails all the time they only said ""see me""

That's it.

Everyone got them and it could be anything from a parent complaint, an investigation into illegal activity, missing a signature or initial on a form, or to tell you that a parent or student said something really nice about you.

No matter how big or small, it was always the same. ""See me.""

After a while you get used to it but the first few time it happens you are always sweating balls.

When new teachers came in we'd always play it up the first few times.

""OH really? What did you do? Well you must have done something, no I've never gotten an email like that. Well, it was good working with you.""

Only for the new hire to come back and say, ""she just wanted to know how I was settling in and if I needed anything for my classroom"""
"I once asked to speak to a manager at Safeway, the employee looked terrified.

I just wanted to praise another employee that went above and beyond expectations to get me what I wanted, and deserved more than a 'comment card' rating."
People that overdramatize a situation like that are either autistic or a child. ‚ÄúWe need to talk‚Äù is used by manipulative pieces of shit that want to put fear into your heart.
"I had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who used to do this constantly. He‚Äôd never say when he wanted to talk or what he wanted to talk about and he‚Äôd spring these big topics on me, like, 30 minutes before I was going to bed on a Tuesday ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs [his] day off tomorrow.‚Äù I told him on more than one occasion that this made me uncomfortable because it was blatantly manipulative tactics to create a hierarchy of information so I couldn‚Äôt respond to what he was saying because I was  always -always- caught off guard. 

Around the time our friendship officially ended the last time he said that to me I just texted him back ‚ÄúNo, WE do not ‚Äòneed‚Äô to talk. YOU /want/ to talk TO ME. I have nothing to say to you. WE do not need to have a conversation. YOU are attempting to invite me to a conversation and failing. I have no desire to speak with you. Point blank period.‚Äù He really didn‚Äôt like that and I got TONS of paragraphs and texts in response. Took a while to realize that he was an emotionally controlling, manipulative piece of shit who was incapable of having real, legitimate friendships. Glad I don‚Äôt have to deal with him anymore."
I remember being at work at getting a text out of nowhere from my girlfriend that just said ‚Äúwe need to talk.‚Äù Immediately I thought that either she was pregnant or she was going to break up with me. It was several minutes before I was able to give her a call, all the while I had so much anxiety wondering which one it was and which one I would prefer to hear. Our relationship was pretty amazing and I was deeply in love with her so I did end up hoping that she wasn‚Äôt breaking up with me. She was.
Yeah, my ex sent that to me and then said she wasn‚Äôt free for that day so i had to sit with that overnight. And then she broke up with me.
Oof I had someone tell me that with them expecting me to be free to talk that day. Had to wait a few excruciating days so I could get dumped.
My wife brought in pizza to my work for my coworkers and I one night. Right when we start eating my supervisor, who was in the room with me,  texted that we needed to talk after we were done eating. I was super stressed out thinking I was in trouble. After my wife left I went to find out my fate. Turns out I was getting a raise! She was the worst at terrifying texts that were nothing.
"My parents, especially my dad had the tendency to text me to call them back as soon as I can. Only once was it important when my grandfather died. Every other time it was some dumb stuff like which weekend I'd come home from uni and stuff.

I eventually told him to stop doing that. Now I have to teach him that the question 'can you talk right now?' always sounds like he wants to discuss state secrets."
Yup - straight line from that to the end of my marriage. Gave up hope 10 weeks later and moved out. 14 years n 3 kids.
"One night my husband and I were awake in bed and I was faced away from him, trying to do something, don't even remember what, but I was failing. In the quiet I sighed and said ""This isn't working...."" My poor husband almost had a heart attack thinking I wanted a divorce or something. Nope, just couldn't get the thingy to work. Sorry!"
"One of my ex's used this all the time. 

""I need to talk to you about something."" 
""Is everything okay?"" 
""Yeah, I just want to tell you about my day."" 

Spent 5 months asking her not to do it because I felt like she was going to break up with me every time. 

She said I shouldn't feel that way. She also started going to school to be a guidance counselor. 

She came home one day and told me she'd learned in class that you shouldn't preface conversation like that because it can load the conversation with undesirable tension. 

Who would have thought?"
Okay. Where to begin? With your constant absenteeism? With your unpresentable appearance? You're up for review...
"I actually timed mine once, just because sometimes it feels like the first 30 seconds takes a minute, bit the other ones are too short.   

It was entirely psychological as each sequence was indeed 30 seconds."
"I'll be daydreaming or looking at reddit and snap back to reality and I'm like ""...did it buzz?  Did I miss it?  Maybe I should switch sides just in ca-"" and then it buzzes."
"This is so intuitive. 

I completely agree. I use that thing twice a day and my relationship with time whilst using it is in constant flux. You‚Äôre correct in saying that at times it can seem like more than a few minutes have passed and the thing vibrates again. 

I‚Äôve had a theory.

Whilst brushing there‚Äôs always a slight chance that each time it vibrates, you don‚Äôt feel it vibrate. Perhaps for a few reasons, you‚Äôre moving it or it‚Äôs position in your hand. 

Then you brush further. I‚Äôm almost convinced this has happened to me."
"Oh my God, that‚Äôs three times as long as it takes me.

Edit: Apparently someone didn‚Äôt realize I was quoting Michael Gary Scott."
100% feel this one to the max. When it feels like it‚Äôs been an eternity on one side, I still can‚Äôt give up and switch before the timers up...
"Those timers are so pointless. Every electric toothbrush I've had just pulses off and on a few times to mark 30 seconds, and while it's pulsing it can't do its job. So every 30 seconds I just have to wait what feels like forever despite being a second or two to have a working electric toothbrush again.

And on top of all that, I have absolutely no reason to know how long I've been brushing. I brush until it's clean."
I've honestly got the opposite problem; I'll be brushing a section of teeth for what seems like 5 seconds and then it's time to switch. It just never feels like long enough to have actually fully cleaned that area
I have one that does this too. I can agree that it does feel so much longer, however, it has a function that pulses, and I just got my wisdom teeth out about a week ago, and the one side of my gums has a bit of a dull ache,,, so it feels good to just let it sit. Lol like a massage.
Good guy doctor giving you the thumbs up cuz he knows you were probably freaking the fuck out watching him walk towards you, but didn't wanna shout across the room as that's unprofessional lol
"Once my son (7 years old at the time) fell off a swing at school, from high up, and told another kid he couldn't move his neck. Cue the school nurse, vice principal and principal getting paged, and I get a call at work that an ambulance has been called but ""don't worry, we haven't moved him and have made sure he has remained in the exact same position"". Like, oh okay cool we've gone from a fall off a swing to an assumption that he may now be a quadriplegic or on his way to becoming one. Needless to say, I was freaking out. I leave work with tears streaming down my face and almost no explanation and drive the 7 minutes to his school in 4 minutes. I get there, don't even shut my car door and start sprinting to the ambulance while I see my son being loaded on a backboard onto a stretcher. EMT yells from 75 feet away: ""Are you mom?"" I nod. He yells again: ""It's okay!! He has sensation  and can move his fingers and toes!"" The seconds between seeing my son on the backboard while in my car, to the moment the EMT spoke, were the longest seconds I have ever lived.  That EMT was my hero that day."
"That was the same for me when the surgeon walked through the waiting room to our family.  I think he could see how tense we all were and he was so good at just immediately saying everything was okay. 

I realized that he probably does that walk all the time and sees the look of absolute terror and fear on peoples faces nearly everyday, so he knows very well how to quickly and succinctly let people know things went well."
"Mine is sadder but similar. When my dad passed away, his friend/employee had taken him to the hospital from work when he started having chest pains, and he went into cardiac arrest while going in for his CAT scan. He was gone before my sister and I got there. His friend had texted my sister from his phone ‚Äúit‚Äôs K and I‚Äôm with your dad at X hospital and you need to come right away.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wanna have to be the one to tell us. 

We showed up and she was sitting alone in his room barely holding it together and said ‚ÄúI think the doctor should tell you what happened‚Äù and just stared at the floor. The 2 minutes or so it took the doctor to come in were  the longest of my life. I think in my gut I already knew from how she couldn‚Äôt look at us.

I‚Äôm glad yours had a happier ending!"
I had a similar moment when my fianc√© went in for emergency surgery at 11pm one day last month, but I couldn't be there because of Covid. I left my phone on loud only for the doctor to phone at 1am. I've been lucky not to have too much experience with hospitals and falsely assumed that someone would only phone in the early hours of the morning if something terrible had happened. The 30 seconds it took him to ask me for my name and tell me everything was fine were some of the most slow and terrifying of my life.
"I feel you pain on that one. When my dad had his cancer removed surgically, they told us it was going to be a minimum of a 10 hour procedure with 3 separate cuts. When the surgeon walked out after only 2 hours, we all collectively held our breath because we thought something had gone wrong.

Luckily, it just turns out the surgeon was one that really gave a shit and came out and updated us after he finished each of the 3 parts of the surgery to make sure we were well informed."
I had to get a CT scan once and when the doctor came in with the results I'm pretty sure she started yelling them at me from the hallway as she was walking through the door.
I'm happy your mom is okay, but while reading this I just imagined 'Greys Anatomy' where sometimes the doctor has to tell someone the news and the show always does it in slow motion lol
"I have had a similar experience.  
After the relief I thought how hard does it have to be to come out and, well, thumbs down..."
Fucking same when my dad had heart surgery last year and we were all waiting in the room for the news and we see her coming
And then you have to wait for all the dummies in front of you to look up from their phones and notice lol
High school buddy told me one time how he always thinks about how long it takes him to see the green light and put his foot on the accelerator. Ever since then it‚Äôs all I think about in that moment
When the traffic light turns to red right in front of you and there is no one there to move for the green.
I mean yeah but there is one traffic light in my city that lasts about 5 minutes on red and about 5 seconds on green.
"Yup - was going to say ""when the light changes to red just as you approach it, and you're waiting for it to turn green"""
"Winchester virginia is notorious for have extremely long red lights. I live in a nearby town in w.v. and as kids we w o.k uld drive around and fuck off. One thing we would do is go to winchester and fool around at walmart. This is how we discovered the lights. At ten p.m. on a deserted intersection we would endnup waiting atleast five - ten minutes. Its been about fifteen years since those days and my husband (god rest him) and i had to get a rental car earlier this year and ended up at one of those lights. He timed it and we literally were there for 9 minures before the car in front of us said screw it and drove on through. 
The lights are also those ones with the censor on it that is supposed to detect traffic. 

I picked up a newspaper from winchester a few weeks ago and read that they had been hearing complaints for years about the traffic lights but the D.O.H. never fixed them because ""they were working properly whenever officers inspected them""."
I was sitting at a red light for what felt like forever. I was one of the front two cars and when I turned left, and got maybe half way down the block, it turned red again. It was green for like 10 seconds
In the UK they go from red to yellow and red and then to green, so you've got an extra few seconds to get in gear and give er
My first time driving alone today, i immidiately thought to myself: it doesnt get any greenner (common german saying) as soon as that guy in front of me didnt drive in the first 5 seconds, i already feel bad
I was late to work one morning and I was two lights away. I got stopped at one and was there for THREE MINUTES just watching all the other cars go
Also, the pause between when the guy in front of you takes his foot off the brake........................and then finally engages the gas, what are you doing with your foot, the pedals are an inch from each other, make it happen.
"I remember a time me and some friends went out to dinner and the staff came out with the cake and candle singing... and I thought cool.  Someone‚Äôs birthday.

Then as they surrounded me and kept singing I looked so confused about what was going on.

Cause it wasn‚Äôt even my birthday.

Just one of the girls thought it would be a funny prank."
"Here's the key to singing happy birthday... Everyone starts way too slow because they're waiting to make sure everyone else joins in. Once that slow tempo gets locked in, we're all in for a long rendition. You gotta be the leader and pick the pace up in the first few words or be the one to say, ""ok, happy birthday on three... 1
..2...3..."" then just dive right in to the quick tempo version. I've saved many agonizing minutes over the last few years by being willing to drag everyone along with me."
No kidding. I'll often sing along. Why? I'm often the best singer in the room and there's a reason I played in the band during school. ;)
"Every year I go out of my way to tell people ""Hey, I don't want to be sung too"" and honestly most people I say that to react with ""Oh thank god"" because they find it awkward too!

I'm not trying to be a fuddy-duddy. But I am in my mid 20's. I don't need the song."
It was on my list for why I quit one of my jobs. Like very low on my list but it still added to it just a little bit.
Its funny how universally, almost everybody finds the act of being sung happy birthday to is awkward as hell yet we continue doing it.
[This Strange World comic](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/471/302/268.jpg) sums up birthdays pretty well.
Stand with arms crossed and a stern look on your face, legs wide apart, chin up, like Benito Mussolini allowing the Italian people to shower him with praise
"I hated that song as a child more than anyone. It didn't even have to be my birthday. I don't know what about it bothered me.

Imagine a 2-year-old hysterically screaming ""SHUT UP! SHUT THE HELL UP!"" with their hands clasping their ears and tears streaming down their face.

I have no memory of *why* I hated the song so much."
"I dont get that anymore

Made sure my parents understand that I hate it, im fine going out for a meal on my birthday but I want no special treatment or attention, no singing no balloons just a meal"
"Oh god oh fuck this brings up a beep repressed memory from like 4 years ago. Birthday dinner at a restaurant, luckily it was only family and no friends cause if there were any of my friends there I wouldn‚Äôt have had any afterwards. The first red flag was my grandma telling me she had a surprise in store for me, knowing my grandma this was going to be bad and oh boy was it bad all right. So with dinner ordered my grandma said she was going to unveil her surprise, leaves and comes back with a radio with a CD player and plugs it into a wall outlet pulls out a CD from her purse the says Happy Birthday u/thatloserguysorta. Then she plays the CD, and the whole fucking restaurant, it was a nice restaurant as well, stopped and turned to see WTF was going on, my cousins were dying of laughter and I was dying of embarrassment as the words came out of the CD player with my grandma half singing along half encouraging the rest of the family to join in on the sing.

I almost jumped out the fucking window, unfortunately it was locked."
not as long as the 30 seconds between spotting the train of waiters/waitresses and one's carrying a cake towards your table and in that moment you want to kill all your friends before the train reaches the table...
At parties growing up my father used to have the dining room table pushed to the back of the room against the wall to make more room for chairs. It was great when they did our birthdays parties like this because you‚Äôd be facing the wall (cake was on the table) and everyone would be singing to your back. And my family sings 2 verses of ‚ÄúHappy Birthday ‚Äú
I always ask them if they want to be sung to and it's honestly kind fo dumb that isn't a more common thing
"My nephew's kindergarten teachers and friends sung him happy birthday when he turned 2 and the look on his face is sooooooo cringe üò≠üòÇ he has no idea where to look and keeps awkwardly smiling and looking left to right, into the camera and on the floor. 
So cute but so uncomfortable."
For my 21st birthday I asked my family to *not* sing happy birthday for me, they asked why and i told them it's awkward and i hate it when everyone's looking at me. We compromised, they sang while deliberately looking away from me. That was great
"You don't sing ""Happy Birthday"" *to* someone so much as you sing it *at* them. I don't think anyone actually likes it."
Well I'd stand, clap and smile as much as I can, because I haven't heard happy birthday last 12 years.
It‚Äôs even worse in school, you have a hole ass classroom of 30 students looking at you while you think ‚Äúwtf should I do‚Äù
My family is threatened under the punishment of death/ total estrangement to not tell the restaurant where eating from my birthday dinner that it is my birthday. I HATE having people stare at me & if I could dissappear in an instant, i WOULD.
I wave my arms like an orchestra conductor, point to myself when ‚Äòyou‚Äô is sung, with a special little flourish on that third line; when my name, or ‚Äòshithead‚Äô, or whatever the chosen nomenclature is for that particular birthday. Definitely helps cut the tension.
"Oh, I hate that song.

When I was a kid and it was my birthday, when people sang it to me, I'd start going ""Stop singing! NO MORE SINGING!!!"""
I usually reflect on my previous year and what I hope to do with the following year. Was a sad one this year with covid spoiling everything.
"On my son‚Äôs fifth birthday he insisted that when his aunts, uncles and grandparents gathered round to sing happy birthday, he had to be naked. I think the awkwardness went the other way that day.

(Me and my wife thought it was hilarious)"
"Singing ""Happy Birthday"" in my family is so hilariously bad. Everyone is, purposefully, doing anything from singing different parts of the song at the same time, some are terribly off key, some are singing in different languages. There hasn't been a proper ""Happy Birthday"" in years. It's such a cluster fuck and I love it."
I don't get the issue with that? if my family members sing it to my it's nice because having my nieces and nephews sing it is incredibly cute. and with my friends I like it because it's awesome that they are willing to make a clown out of themselves for the sake of celebrating me.
"My step son requested we not sing to him. I totally respected it, but had this awkward moment when handing him his cake. After 10 seconds i just smiled and said ""happy you were born kiddo"". As an anxious person myself, I'll do my best to respect his wishes."
Also, why does happy birthday always sound so terrible? I have heard trained chorus  groups sing it even who are all fantastic singers and it always sounds like shit.
"In Germany we have the normal happy birthday song with a few changed lyrics, and a song that is very different and can go up two two minutes, depending on how much you include. The worst part is that nearly no one knows the lyrics to the second minute, making it an uncomfortable time singing and listening as everyone starts to mumble.

If you want to look up the song, you can find it under ""Heute kann es regnen, st√ºrmen oder schnein"""
Illegal! Illegal! (As of like 5 years ago, it no longer is) Disney filed a copyright troll on this song! They actually busted a birthday party and sued the parents.
It was my birthday the other week, and our uni had a virtual mixer get together event. It was a bit impersonal, and I don‚Äôt mention it‚Äôs my birthday to anyone during most of the event. Then, towards the end, my one friend chimes in and says it‚Äôs my birthday, so *of course* they decide that they have to sing for me since it‚Äôs my birthday. It was a really nice gesture, but coordinating singing over Zoom is not really the most feasible or graceful. The song last about twice as long as a typical ‚ÄúHappy Birthday‚Äù, and it was certainly something. That definitely had to be the longest 30+ seconds for me in a while...
My best friend sings to me over the phone every year. Super sweet...but it's still just so awkward while I silently wait for her to finish.
God my family draws it out by adding more random verses. The more uncomfortable you look the more they add. Sometimes they'll even start singing For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.
I know this is an unpopular opinion but enjoy when my friends and family sing me happy birthday. The only time it sucks is when it‚Äôs in public or they do it at the restaurant. When there‚Äôs tons of strangers around I hate it.
And that's not even close to 30 seconds. A slow Happy Birthday will be sung in about 15 seconds. Still feels more like 45 seconds.
This is why you should name your child Happybirthdaytoyou. It fucks up the whole song and then nobody will do it again.
My friends wanted to sing me happy birthday over Skype this year. I said ok, but I was gonna sing along cause otherwise it felt like too much attention and that makes me so anxious my insides start to shrivel and curl. They laughed at me the whole time and it was actually quite fun.
My solution is to blow out the candles right when the cake hits the table. Everyone just stops singing.
"Best birthday song ever (sung to the tune of tea-la-la-boom-de-ay):

‚ÄúThis is your birthday song! It isn‚Äôt very long!‚Äù"
I remember at my 4th or 5th birthday party, we were at this science museum where the AC broke right at the start of summer. When it came time for singing Happy Birthday, I don‚Äôt know what happened, but I started bawling. It‚Äôs like the anxiety and stress of all of the attention mixed with the heat just caused me to have a total meltdown.
I have one request on my birthday and that is that no one sing happy birthday to me. 364 days out of the year they can sing it, but on my day, no.
I've never understood the issue. Just put your hands in a resting position and smile glancing from person to person.
Move your hands as if you are conducting them. Then halfway through, stop them, tell them Barb was flat, and have them take it from the top.
I have begun goading the people singing, ask them if that‚Äôs all they got, sing it like you mean it! Put some feeling into it, I only get one birthday per year.
I'm the exact opposite on this one.  I love it.  I eat the attention up.  I'm in my element when all attention is on me.
People always say this on here but I don't get it at all. Look around and/or just at the cake and smile. Easy
"a few years ago coming home from camp I had to pee so bad. like it hurt for probably 15 minutes that how bad it was. so the bus stopped and I had to get off the bus and pee on the side of the road. what really sucked was that the road was next to a hill and I had to go partly up the hill because there was barbed wire about halfway up.

(I had to pee so bad because I drank around 2 liters of water in one shot before the bus left.)"
It‚Äôs those last 30 seconds walking to the bathroom and trying to unfasten your pants that really does you in though...
My friend once got off a bus to go pee, knowing it would take two hours for the next bus to get there.
I got stuck in very bad traffic one day on may way home from work and had to pee extremely badly. Managed to finally pull into a Mcdonald's and did not make it out of my car and peed my pants at age 25 1 minute away from the restroom.
Or the moment you are opening your front door and you have that urge. The bathroom is not close enough, dammit.
I had these 3 days at school where I just couldn‚Äôt pee, or barely could. On the final day, on the bus ride back, my bladder felt like it was genuinely going to explode, and my pelvic muscles were twitching.
"On my 22nd birthday, I was in town drinking with some friends at the pub. I had a great time and caught the last bus home. My village was 45 minutes away by bus, but I just had to pee SO badly. It was the last bus of the night, but I was in so much pain that half an hour in, I got off the bus at the stop next to a pub in one of the villages in between. I went in and they let me use the bathroom, then I came back to the pub and hung out with everyone while the bartender called me a cab. One of my mom's sleazy former colleagues was a regular there but wasn't there that night, and everyone loved hearing me say I didn't like him and were laughing away. I enthusiastically showed them my socks and they all sang me happy birthday. When the cab came the driver ended up giving me a big discount since it was my birthday, and I made it home sometime after midnight.

All that is to say, sometimes it works out."
"I frequently drive a 7 hour trip from where I live in Pittsburgh to where I grew up in the middle of nowhere. Even the tiniest towns along the way at least have a gas station. However there‚Äôs one stretch, for only 45 minutes, where you go up and over a mountainous area and there is absolutely NOTHING for 45 minutes. 

This is, inevitably, always when I get an excruciating urge to pee. Even if I made sure to stop and pee at the last town before this stretch. Every time."
I remember being on the motorway for a good few hours and there was no services for a while. I needed it so bad I was in physical pain and crumpled over. Like pain. Not fun. When I got to the services I couldn't find the women's toilets and it hurt so I just stumbled into the disabled (':
I once was coming home from the bar downtown and I lived in the burbs so it was something like a 30-40 minute bus ride all the way to a transfer then home. I had stupidly not gone before leaving but I figured I had the fortitude to at least make it to the transfer point. Well turns out tonight of all nights the drawbridge at the edge of town decides to malfunction in the up position and for what seemed like 20 minutes (but was probably only less than 10) it stayed up and there we  were, a bus full of people and me increasnigly feeling actual pain at holding it in. Was so bad I had to get off the bus early and just find a bush. Never felt so much relief in my life.
IBS is like this, but worse. Imagine being 3/4 of the way through when you feel a bubble in your gut and suddenly have the overwhelming urge to spray liquid shit all over everything in a 3‚Äô radius. Oh, I guess that peppermint candy I ate 15 seconds ago fucked me up, because now this is happening. (Seriously, it‚Äôs amazing how quickly your gut reacts to the weirdest things.) You‚Äôve got about 2 minutes to find a bathroom before your asshole is too weak to hold it back any longer, and the clock is already ticking. You‚Äôll also be treated to some cramps and nausea, just to keep you entertained in the meantime.
One time i went on an hour long relaxing walk by the sea with my friend. Halfway through i got an 7/10 diarrhea intensity urge to shit
Seriously. Some random days I'll be driving and it's like the most excruciatingly painful urge to pee hits and I'm like counting the seconds at the traffic light while I writhe about.
I had a similar experience with the last bus outa Glasgow one night. A party bus if youv ever seen it but the toilet was outa order. We came to a stop and I ran down the stairs told the driver my back teeth was swimming n I had to go. When I got back on the bus and up the stairs everyone gave me a round of applause. My first ever and just for a pee lol.
"I can relate, I usually feel like asking for a rest stop would slow down my parents, but will ask them when I need to go and we see the ""Rest Stop: Next Exit"" sign"
Daytime drunk on a train when people are coming home from work is the worst. Brings you right back to reality.
The worst is on a plane, when they are starting the descent and you realize you have to pee. And then you get delayed pulling into the gate. And you‚Äôre in row 30 so you‚Äôre not quite last off the plane.
One time when I was traveling overseas I decided to eat some suspiciously cheap street vendor ice cream and had to keep myself from violently projectile vomiting on someone's head on the route back to where I was staying.
Back when I went to school and whenever I was close to my house I would have the urge to go to the toilet.
A few years ago, I felt really ill at the start of the nightshift and threw up 3 time till they finally let me go home, I had to take the bus home (which drives by the university area, means a lot of people üòÇ). I tried not to throw up in front of everyone, so I hold it back and even if it was only 20 minutes it felt like hours...
The worst ones are those when you're desperately trying to get your keys out to open your appartment's door.
Funny story, one time i just couldnt hold it, so i got off at my library which was quite a while from my house. Like two miles.
I caught a stomach bug last year. Was very pregnant and at work where I felt my stomach turn. I put my things away, didn‚Äòt even say bye to anyone, left way too early, waited for the bus (4 minutes where I almost puked in the bushes in front of my building). Then an 8 minute bus ride with closed eyes. Running home. 2 minutes. While running texted my husband ‚Äûdoor‚Äú. He opened the door just as I got there. I ran past him into the bathroom and threw up with my jacket, backpack and all still on. Spot on. Longest 15 minutes of my life üòÇ
Our bus had to let a lady off to have a wee at the park, she had to just squat behind a telephone cable box. Must have been an emergency, we all politely looked the other way.
I learned a trick to this on here; picture the bathroom hours away, you‚Äôre not anywhere close. It allows the brain to calm down and not exaggerate the need to pee
"We recently let our receptionist go and so I've been filling in answering phones along with another guy from my department who comes in an hour and a half after me.

It's normally no issue, but yesterday, with 20 minutes until he got there, I had to poop. That was the longest 20 minutes in recent memory."
When I went to Disney World last december, I didn't prepare my feet enough for it, so I was in some noticeable pain by the end of the day. Usually I remedied that by an evening bath, and sitting down on the bus usually helped. One ride back there was no seats left, and that was probably the longest 10 minutes of my life.
I was once on a bus for 9 hours after spending all morning having the worst diarrhea of my life. I had to shit so bad. That fucken hurt.
"To pee? I can handle to pee. But diarrhea is a different monster.
If you had put a piece of coal in between my ass cheeks they would have become diamonds. Standing there in the bus, already at the door. I could perceive everything around me, amplified by pain, fear and intense concentration. Every pearl of sweat traveling down my temple a testament to my peril. The handrail suffered under my iron grip, slowly giving way to my unrelenting knuckles. And then the stop came into view. Was it my stop? No it wasn't, but it had to be today, it had to be now.
The walk, oh the walk, like the last leg on the journey to Mount Doom through Mordor. Every step a struggle, every stride a fight all the while the pavement stones were indifferent to my suffering. And then salvation was there, a glorious Burger King was waiting with a pristine toilet for me to use... on the second floor.

Eventually I sat on the porcelain throne. Calling my parents to pick me up and bring new trousers and underwear.
I didn't make it. I shat my pants."
"If you're 3/4th the way home, that means the 30 seconds in question is 1/4 your trip, so it's only 2 minutes from door to door.

Should have gone before you left."
I used to ride the bus, but my bus stop was right in front of a bar. So naturally, I would have couple drinks while waiting for the bus, sometimes I would miss a couple busses, but anyway the pee urge was a daily occurence.
I know this sounds crazy, but if you can give yourself an erection, you will survive it easier.   Also, I apologize if I just made this NSFW.
"3/4? That is a blessing. After a hard night of drinking in Chicago, hopped half-asleep onto the Blue line from downtown to Rosemont (almost to O'Hare) and the overwhelming urge hit leaving the station. Had to force myself to sleep and wake cycle to hold out.

Finally crash out of the train like a bullet 40 minutes later only to find there's no bathroom open because it's about 5:40 AM but it's also not dark anymore either.

TL;DR Why does the Blue Line take 40 minutes to go 10 miles?"
I used to live in the northern midwest and really tried to avoid the gas stations that slowed their roll too much
I understand your pain. When its -40 and your face hurts and the inside of your legs start to freeze...
Back in high school teachers thought it would be a good idea to wait until the end of class to pass back exams because they thought people wouldn‚Äôt pay attention once they received their grades. For me it was quite the opposite‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt sit still and pay attention throughout the entire lesson because I was so afraid (excited, worried?) about getting my grade back. For some reason it didn‚Äôt seem like many other kids cared as much about getting their grades back.
And in 2nd place........................................................................with a score of 98.6....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................(finally announces name)!
My teacher hands out tests in ascending order... You're just praying to God each time that it's not your name.
I hate that CompTIA makes you take a short survery before they tell you your scores. Like STOP AND JUST SHOW ME
The board exam I had to take after earning my masters meant waiting a full month for results. I had student loan payments waiting and my professional reputation  on the line. I needed to pass. Results happened to come out on the night of our company Christmas party. I got myself lit and then cried in the bar because the website wouldn‚Äôt load with so many people trying to log in to see their test results. It wasn‚Äôt a good look...especially when the bartender refused to serve me anymore.
Back in school I had a teacher who would always before handing out our tests talk about what people did wrong at every task. He wouldn't say who made the mistakes which only made it worse, because it always took him about 30 minutes to go threw all tasks. Afterwards everyone just felt really bad, because everyone was unsure if they did the mistakes he talked about. That was always so much pressure because everyone just wanted to get their results and be over with it.
I run back and forth through my kitchen with a goal of 1 run per ten seconds. I get really fit waiting for my cheesy Dorito wrap and it makes time fly
I found a solution to this. I get other things ready while I'm waiting. Like putting food back in the fridge, pouring water so I have a drink with my food, pulling out a fork if I haven't already, stuff like that.

"I think I've trivialised ""I need to tell you something..."" with my boyfriend accidentally so it won't be bad when I keep doing it accidentally. I've said ""I need to tell you something, I love you"" way too many times..."
I remember my best friend in highschool put his head in his hands and shed a few tears saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd do this to me, John!‚Äù I was distraught, I had no idea what I had done but was so sorry for whatever it was I did and wanted to make things right! ‚ÄúYou made me lose The Game.‚Äù Fuckin Darrell
My fucking cousin did this. Acted like it was some huge deal. I used to go to a christian youth group with him when we were in our teens so maybe he assumed I was overly religious or something? He confessed he was an atheist. I am too. I'm pretty sure he knew I was too.
"I have a guy friend who does stuff like this CONSTANTLY. 

‚Äú<my name> I have a question for you‚Äù in a super, super serious voice as if he‚Äôs about to ask something super personal and deep, then he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your favorite food‚Äù and I‚Äôm like ???

‚ÄúWe need to discuss something‚Äù (it ended up being sushi or something) 

‚ÄúI have something I need to talk with you about‚Äù (was like a class he wanted to take) 

But his tone of voice is always so...serious"
"For me I already freak out whenever someone says my name followed by ""can I ask you something?"" in a one-on-one setting.

I always expect a profound or deeply personal question. Then it's some trivial nonsense and life is back to normal. And then I don't know if I'm relieved or disappointed."
This is the truth tight here. Especially the disassociation afterwards where it feels like nothing is real and you're disconnected from time. Its terrifying to know that your mind/body are just.. capable of doing that.
Can confirm. Had my first anxiety/panic when my ex was leaving, and the 15 or so minutes it took to calm down felt like hours, if not days.
So fucking true, there‚Äôs been times where my panic attacks get so bad where I start physically shaking badly, like unable to stay still, and it feels like it‚Äôs an eternity
True, especially those first couple of seconds when you get triggered and you know you're going into the panic attack and try your hardest to stop it and usually fail miserably anyway
Fucking eh, they suck. The first time I had one, I was 100% convinced that I was dying. The most terrifying moment in my life.
"My first panic attack lasted 6 hours. I was in the movies inside a shopping mall. The mall doctor neglected my symptoms ‚Äì Probably thought it was abstention from illegal drugs.

My life hasn't been the same since then :("
Last night I had the 2nd worst anxiety attack in my life and it took an extra hour afterwards for me to finally feel like myself again... I never wanna experience that ever again
Anxiety/Panic attacks; These are new to me... Very much not fun. I don't remember ordering these but I can't return them. 1/5 stars
I remember one time that happened and my hands balled into fists; and I could not, for all the willpower I like to think I have, un ball them.  Scary AF
Interesting. I never really felt this way about panic attacks. I only get panic attacks thinking about the inevitability of death. That shit really hits me hard. But I can usually force it out of my head relatively quickly.
Try using sensory engagement to break the attack: https://thriveworks.com/blog/use-your-5-senses-to-reduce-stress-and-anxiety/
Going back in should never be the option. Poop that has seen freedom must never return to tell of it to future generations.
Those are horrible. You can just sit there for why could be hours before it drops, or you can chop it. But you know once you relax and chop it it‚Äôs straight to shower - no amount of tp can handle that mess.
so, next time, try this.  rock your hips until you can get the back of the seat to push on you right around your coccyx.  Sometimes you'll have to push there repeatedly, but man, it works like magic.
The cringe when you think back to how hilarious you thought it was and the complete lack of emotion they show towards it... really makes you question your life choices.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever experienced the slowing of time until I did a plank. There‚Äôs some kind of time warp.
I'm like 100% positive OP made this thread specifically for this answer. Some tweet just went viral a day ago talking about how time warping is real and if you don't believe it then try planking for a minute.
"I remember going in to planks being all cocky thinking ""The fuck is this baby bullshit? Just be straight for a while?""

Hhhhholy shit. At least I wasn't alone. Nine and a half years later my friend asked ""What do you ***mean*** it's only been ***fifteen seconds?!***"""
I don‚Äôt mind the plank, I find it one of the more restful exercises in my circuit, now wallsit on the other hand, feels like it lasts an eternity.
I like how you said one word, simply ‚Äúplank‚Äù and you got 4.3k upvotes and 3 awards, so many people agree
"Can‚Äôt believe I scrolled down this low for this. 

I would also add: the time that passes when you‚Äôre on the treadmill."
Yep! Spent a few years in the 1600s as a pirate, the pay is alright, but walking the plank is *anxiety inducing*
Have you tried Chloe Ting's up and down plank jacks? Because I already can't do planks but that is a monstrosity. I don't even know how to coordinate.
I swear to god it's already been 30 seconds, and when I look at the clock near me it's only been 5 seconds.
"Fuck man, I wrote this, scrolled down, and saw this

"On Monday, I started adding 30 seconds of planks to my daily workouts to try and strengthen my weak af abs.

I didn‚Äôt Realize a week could feel so long lol"
For the longest time, I was like ‚Äúplanking isn‚Äôt so hard whats the deal?‚Äù I had bad form. Now I‚Äôll keep my core tight, squeeze my ass cheeks and try to stay flat. It‚Äôs hell. I‚Äôve found the secret to the burn is the ass clench.
I thought this was a shitpost at first but remembered ‚Äòplank‚Äô isn‚Äôt just that guy from Ed, Edd and Eddy
I smash through planks, always have. I had  other people check my form just because I couldn‚Äôt believe I was doing it right with it being so easy. I can probably do a 2 minute plank right now. It‚Äôs certainly the fucking lamest super power anyone‚Äôs ever has though.
I'm ok with plank that goes for minutes. I do understand that MAJORITY of people cannot do plank or just positioning themselves in a push up position.

I saw the 2009 Watchmen film with my dad. I swear to God there's a 3 minute sex scene that just doesn't end.
Lmao I watched the first episode of Breaking Bad with my parents yesterday. This is incredibly accurate.
"Its funny, because now with my own daughter, she gets really shy if people kiss in a movie we are watching. Once we were watching a movie she had seen before and knew the two people were going to kiss (I forget which movie, but is was a PG movie), and she suddenly had the urge to run to her room with me and show me a painting she had made. She then runs back to the living room and whispers to my wife if the kissing scene was over, and then comes back to me and says ""Ok that was it, lets go watch the movie!"""
"worse when you‚Äôre 12 and you can get an erection just because air comes in contact with your face

*thanks for buying so many throw pillows mom*"
Oh god I remember when I was in high school and was watching No Way Out with my parents. There's a scene where they get into a limo, and all of a sudden I remembered that it was going to be a sex scene. I JUMPED up off the floor and shouted something about wanting to get something to drink. I was gone for like 10 minutes until I knew the coast was clear, and went back into the room. Looking back, they TOTALLY knew lol.
"There is an SNL skit about this where the kid is watching Terminator with his parents.  It has Pete Davidson as the kid with Aidy Bryant as his Mom and I think Beck Bennett is his Dad.

Edit:  it is not Beck Bennett it is Bobby Moynahan.  And it is not Aidy Bryant it is Melissa McCarthy."
"Without knowing much about it I saw the unrated The Wolf of Wall Street in theater with my mom. 

I was crying laughing while my mom tried to cover my eyes, as a grown man, during the part where leo is doing coke out of the hooker's ass. Good times."
Shout out to my friend who went home from college for a weekend and took his mom to see Black Swan in the theater.
"This happened with me and my dad. He just HAD to come in when i was watching the movie Notorious (about notorious b.i.g) and it was right before the sex scene.

Bruhh I went to watch the first Deadpool with me mum when it just hit the theatre; it was right around me 15th birthday. The egregious violence was fine apparently but there was a generous strip club scene that turned us both beet red. Funny stuff.
Watched Bad Santa in a movie theater with my parents.  Luckily, I was 21 and it was the Alamo Drafthouse, because I ordered ALL THE BEER.  Oof.

I remember driving cross country with my dad while listening to an audio book on cd. About half way through a theres a sex scene, and 13 year old me and my dad sit in utter silence for what feels like 30 minutes. Definitely the most awkward drive I've ever been on.
Christ.... flashbacks of watching the opening scene of Bridesmaids with my mom in the cinema .... so very awkward.
Lol I wrote about the same thing xdd, when the Durex condom commercial plays during the ad break while watching IPL (Indian premier league) xd
Your senses suddenly become god tier and your own breathing sounds like a blow dryer. Then you slowly sink into your seat trying to shield yourself from view. Then you look over to see what their reaction is but they are doing the same so you make eye contact and then you just thrown yourself off the roof because it‚Äôs easier.
For some reason this happened to me when I was showing my gilfriend and her parents Return of the Jedi for the first time. The jedi rocks dance song scene was so uncomfortable for me after hyping Star Wars up, I was sweating.
I once suggested to my parents we watch Love Actually, forgetting about the scene on the porn shoot where two of the characters meet. Awkward!
"YESSSS! My mom and I recently watched two series together. Well, one was a few series that are intertwined. The White Queen (then White Princess, Spanish Princess) and then The Tudors. I told her she wouldn't want to watch them with me but she said ""how bad could they be?"" Pretty bad, mom!"
Even worse: we watched a series in class (last year in vocational training, we had all our stuff done so we watched one episode each day of a banking series, was remotely linked to our employment field) that had a pretty... Kinky (?) sex scene. Our teacher knew that it came - and he watched it with us. He didn't even flinch, let the whole sex scene roll while 20 young adults were awkwardly trying to ignore the moaning and clapping.
30 seconds ? In the movies I watch with my parents, the sex is like 28 of the 30 minutes. What kind of weird-ass porn are you watching?
Hmm, I never realized the pattern of the floor in the house I‚Äôve lived in for 15 years is very interesting
Thank god for cell phones. Whenever one comes on you can just pretend you‚Äôre replying to a text or something. When I was younger tho and didn‚Äôt have a cell phone I‚Äôd just use that time to go use the bathroom or get some water from the kitchen or something. Anything to get me away from the uncomfortableness.
I just don't watch films with my parents anymore. It's not worth having it ruined [the drama in general by having people ask questions, or the sex scene if it's hot]
Bruh just watch it. They are too. Especially embarrass *them* if you act aroused to a movie *they* tried to show #you
HBO is an absolute minefield for this. We were watching *Rome* cause my mom loves ancient history, and one episode had a seemingly endless camera pan up this guy's *gigantic* dick. Pretty sure I felt my soul leaving my body from cringing so hard.
"My dad would always cuss out the movie when a sex scene came on, turn it off, and then yell at us for picking a movie like that. 

But movies with violence? Perfectly ok with him."
"*[2 Minutes before the ad starts]*

Me: ‚ÄúI need to use the bathroom real quick.‚Äù

My parents: ‚ÄúOh, okay do you want us to pause until you get back?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúNo No, that‚Äôs fine.‚Äù"
At least you didn't carpool to go see the Wolf of Wall Street in a theater with your girlfriend and her parents... The car ride afterward is the best part.
I was watching the Eric Andre Show and my mom walked in right at the start of a skit where he's watching porn in a caf√©. Stress level was 100
I remember the homosexual jail sex scene watching *Midnight Express* with my parents when I was 11.  (R  rated movies were perfectly acceptable in my home.)
I watched wolf of Wallstreet with both parents. No one mentioned the amount of sex to me when they let me know how good the movie was.
"This becomes infinatly more awkward if it was you that suggested the film to your parents, forgetting there was a sex scene in it.

I'll admit, its happened to me on more than one occasion..."
I'll see your 'sex scene while watching a movie with your parents' and raise you a 'sex scene starring your childhood friend while watching a movie with your parents'. We knew she was in the movie, was not prepared for that, though. The horror.
"I have nightmares of when my mom took me to see the matrix reloaded. The dance scene started and a booby would pop up every once in a while which was proceeded by a bag of popcorn being pushed in front of my face to block my view. 

Neo banging Trinity was a-ok! But the few random boobies were not?"
Sex scenes in movies are gratuitous 90% of the time too which makes it more infuriating that you had to sit through those awkward moments just bc the writers felt like shoehorning an un-needed romance angle into the movie.
It‚Äôs the early eighties, there‚Äôs just been a home video revolution and my grandmother has a VCR, the first in the entire family.  So we offer to get movies from one of the new local video stores that have opened.  One of the movies is Body Heat with Kathleen Turner and William Hurt.  They have a torrid affair and, at one point, all you see is Kathleen Turner‚Äôs head, her chin resting on the floor and moving back and forth rhythmically.  I was seated at the table watching and my mom, dad, aunt, and grandmother were all on the couch and easy chairs behind me.  I could only either watch or look backwards and either way I would have died of embarrassment.  I watched and died of embarrassment.  Thank your lucky stars you have the IMDb, folks.  Now, you probably won‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ‚Äúa mystery‚Äù when it goes deeper than that.  What did we watch the next weekend?  Eating Raoul.  I was 14.
That's why I never watch a Showtime/Stars/HBO series with my parents. If it's something I think they'll like, I'll recommend it to them so they can watch it on their own.
"OMG reminds me of the time I me my wife's parents for the first time. Everyone had gone to bed and it was just me and her mom watching a movie...No Way Out with Kevin Costner.

Then there's this sexy scene in the back of a limo.  The longest Xseconds of my life, watching a real boner-inducing, steamy sex scene with my girlfriend's mom alone in a dimly lit room and a large-screen TV. It was SOOOO uncomfortable.

But, if you're looking for a good movie you youngsters  have probably never seen, as long as you can forgive the late-80s technology, it's a good flick. Mild spoiler: one of the movie's key components is scanning and extracting a positive image off a polaroid peel-off negative. It takes a couple of days."
It doesn't help when you're trying to get your parents to watch The Room and there's three of them in the span of 10 minutes?
Really? That wasn't too bad for me. It was definitely uncomfortable but not unbearable. When I got them after my braces I had to have my top teeth done lile 10 times because she kept messing up the ratios and it wouldn't come out right.
"The mold doesn't bother me. It's those hard plastic things they jam in your mouth so they can x-ray your teeth that I hate. They hurt my gums a lot. Plus, I have a phobia of suffocating, so my brain goes, ""There's a big thing jammed into your mouth. You're clearly choking. You're DYING. PANIC."""
My experience was very not good... I had a cold, so my nose was stuffy. Could only breathe out of my mouth, then they jammed that thing in there and then I just couldn‚Äôt breathe at all. I panicked and tried to get them to take it out but they just kept saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all right hun, just a little bit longer, try to relax‚Äù and just when my vision was going dark and fuzzy, they took it out. Never. Ever. Again.
my orthodontist actually did this new thing where they use a pen looking thing that takes a 3D panorama? (the best I can describe it) if your teeth. as they move the thing around your mouth it shows up more on the 3d model
Oh my fucking god. I had this done and they used metal trays that cut into the bottom of my mouth. I couldn't communicate what was happening, so I just sat there and cried in pain until they finally removed them. The bottom was covered in blood when they took it out.
 Apparently I just can't run a consistent speed, because I am constantly either almost falling off the back of the treadmill or stepping on the front lip and almost falling.
"[I‚Äôm the father in the following story]

Oh god yes! When my daughter was born, she wasn‚Äôt crying or breathing. I thought all babies cry right when they are born. She wasn‚Äôt crying or breathing, and they took her quickly to a machine in the corner. She also looked blue/red. I thought she was stillborn. It felt like a really strange wave hit me, like I was not in reality at that moment. I went on auto-pilot and blanked out for a second. I was definitely not ok. Everything felt like it was in slow motion. I was experiencing pure dread as I walked to the doctor, terrified of what they were going to tell me. When I got to their station, they were doing stuff with her really quickly and it felt like they‚Äôd done it many times before. At the time, I thought they were trying to revive her. Then they pull some stuff out of her mouth and my daughter starts crying/breathing. I am still not entirely ‚Äúthere,‚Äù because I thought we weren‚Äôt in the clear yet. I ask a doctor if she‚Äôs ok, and why she isn‚Äôt crying. I was preparing myself for a difficult answer. Doctor says ‚Äúoh yeah, she‚Äôs fine. Just have to get this stuff out of her mouth. It‚Äôs not like it is in the movies.‚Äù I‚Äôve never felt such relief before. I was irrationally and extremely angry at the entertainment industry for not portraying what birth is actually like, but that faded and I kind of laughed about it later. I didn‚Äôt talk at all during my internal breakdown, except for the doctor when I asked if she was ok. I‚Äôve had some pretty difficult experiences in my life, certainly nothing really crazy like what you would experience in war or anything like that, but for me, that was the most horrified I‚Äôve ever been. I think it was one of the only times I‚Äôve ever actually gone into shock.

Edit: It was several years ago, so I don‚Äôt remember the name of the machine or what exactly they were doing. I remember there being some fluid in their mouth, and they have to scoop it out. The baby doesn‚Äôt cry until then. Sorry for using terms like ‚Äústuff,‚Äù I just don‚Äôt remember well enough to say what it was. I was kind of in a weird place at the time. It was surreal.

Edit 2: putting ‚Äú[I‚Äôm the father in the following story]‚Äù at the top for clarification.

Edit 3: my experience is apparently a pretty common one. I hope those that read this remember to tell others of their experience and what to expect. Maybe we can prevent other people from going through the same ordeal."
My daughter scored poorly on her first APGAR (? The test they give babies right after they're born?) She didn't cry for what felt like forever. Worst 30 seconds of my life. So far.
"My son was born after a miscarriage so I was already pretty nervous, the first heartbeat check felt like it went on forever. After two minutes or so she said ""there's your heartbeat"" and I relaxed and she went ""oh, no... I meant your heartbeat, not the baby's"". I managed to keep it together for another two minutes until she found it at which point she was rejoicing and saying ""most people are tears by that point"". Man, it felt like half an hour!"
I know this feeling.  My wife (now ex) had a cescerian with my boy and he was just caughing and gagging and I was freaking out.  They rushed him away and had to stick a tube down his throat to suck fluid from his lungs.  Then he took a huge breath and started crying.  Never been so happy to hear a crying baby!
This just happened to me 18 days ago with twins. It was agonizing and exciting and joyous all at once.
"Ho. Lee. Shit.

So true.

My first had a potential problem in utero and the (probably 15) seconds before he cried was an eternity."
"Oh, god yes - that's horrible. 

My first had the umbilical cord wrapped around him and got stuck on the way out, so they just janked him out of me and ran to get him on a machine to get him breathing. There was no time to explain to me or the dad what was happening, so all I saw was a blue lump, not moving. I said ""is he dead?"" and then we waited for a whole eternity before he cried.

Roughly 30 seconds from they got him out, till they got him breathing. Yes, he's completely fine and old enough to roll his eyes at me."
The whole world rested on the edge of a razor. Either my daughter would cry and everything would work out or the silence would turn everything black.
Hopefully this will help someone... if the baby has pooped before being born, we try not to stimulate the baby because we DON‚ÄôT want them to cry until we have cleared their mouth. Otherwise, they may inhale it into their lungs. I always warned my patients first. Sometimes babies cry anyway. And some babies need a little more stimulation to get that first cry out. All babies are different. Nurses are tough, don‚Äôt freak out - we got this!
Yep. We were under the impression that our daughter was dying and needed to be born NOW, which is why they brought in the vacuum thingie. I remember hearing the doctor telling me that it could cause bleeding on the brain but they had to do it because my daughter's heart rate was dropping, ok let's get this show on the road. Then a few pushes, she's out, and I hear nothing but the rushing in my ears of pure abject terror. Idk exactly how long I lay in that bed getting stitched back up while they evaluated her on the NICU crash cart, but it was far far too long, especially since she had an APGAR of 9. I cannot fully convey the feeling of helplessness and fear of not knowing if your child is alive and not being able to get an answer from anyone.
"In one of the Charles Dickens books, this happens. Lady had like 6 stillborn kids. In hospital for the first time, and kid comes out blue. Doctor says: Oxygen!

She doesn't even know that word. Hooks the kid up to the machine, then baby starts breathing. Powerful scene."
My mom had such a visceral reaction to my firstborn not immediately crying that she had a hesrt attack. I had to see them pulling out my mom on a stretcher while recovering from the shock of seeing my son come out blue. They are both okay now and my son is six!
Second this!! My baby wasn't breathing when she first came out and it was the scariest 30 seconds of my life!
"1000000% yes! My daughter still wasn't breathing at the 1 minute mark and time never felt slower. I remember whispering to myself over and over again ""cry, please cry"". The only comfort I had was in the half I second I had seen her before they wisked her off to the corner of the room with an entire NICU team there her eyes were wide open and darted around. So I knew at least in the second she was born, she hadn't died yet."
"I had an emergency c-section due to pre-eclampsia. My blood pressure was dangerously high and baby was coming 6 weeks early. I see the doctor pull baby away from me, and there is absolutely no sound. It's silent as a grave in the operating room. And then, a nurse squeals, ""Hair!""
I'm thinking, ""Bitch, I do not care if he has hair. Is he breathing?!""
And then he started crying; nothing else mattered anymore."
"When I was born I wasnt breathing. As my mum tells it I was blue and limp.

I have an older sister so my mum was expecting something similar.

Anyway after the birth the docs obviously noticed I wasn't breathing on my own so they whisked me over to the table. 

My mum ""is everything alright?""

Frantic doctors "".........""

My mum ""ahem IS HE OK!"" 

a few more doctors enter the room. 

They start slapping my feet?

My mum ""IS HE OKAY??""

My mum to my dad ""does my voice work?""

My dad ""...........""

""More frantic doctoring""

My mum ""EXCUSE ME IS HE OKAY??""

Doctor ""slaps my feet hard""

Me ""waaaaaaggggghhhhh

Doctor turns to my mum and shouts 

 ""DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?""

now I have had this story told by my parents every year. It's never changed and it always ends with my mum saying

""longest 30 seconds of my life""

Then I start singing ""I'm a survivor........"""

Kinda in the same area, when your mom told you to wait in line at the grocery store while she goes grabs one more thing.  Cue panic as you get closer to the front and there's no sign of her.....
Oh my this is so me! Every fucking time since I got that card like 8 years ago. Worst part for me - 3 times I actually didn‚Äôt have enough money and the cashiers were so rude which made it so much worse :(
I usually have plenty of money now. But the lasting issues that being broke all my teen and young adult life has caused has left its lasting impression on my mind.
"My card was declined like 2 days ago at a bakery. I was like ???? It's the second of the month, I know there is enough money to pay for a bread in my account??? 
Turned out my card is broken and I need a new one. Yay."
"Or when your chip is wonky and you're convincing the people around you that you have money but your card is fuckered up. ""I hate these stupid chip cards."" ""They were supposed to make life easier."" ""It does this all the OH, THANK GOD."""
"The most horrifying moment when I was a teenager was when my dad sent me to the store to pick up some pop. He gave me one of his cards and then gave me the wrong pin.

It was humiliating."
"If anyone is wondering what middle-class really feels like... 

It's swiping your card and not having any of these thoughts."
Or if you‚Äôre like me and you stand there like an idiot after swiping your card and nothing happens, only for the cashier to finally tell you to put the card in the chip reader.
I had to pay for parking at the hospital and, of course, the machine doesn‚Äôt take change. So now the security guard, some nurses, all the COVID screeners, other patients, and my 3 year old are waiting for me to dig through my purse to grab my credit card. I am now sweating and praying that this $3 charge goes through. After an eternal 30 seconds, there was a huge sense of relief when it flashed ACCEPTED. Unfortunately, you can‚Äôt high five anyone anymore so I had to play it cool like I knew it was gonna go through the whole time.
This is pretty much why I always have cash. Not because I want to pay anything with cash, but just in case this were to ever happen to me.

I felt this except on my card it‚Äôs chip wouldn‚Äôt work in the chip reader. It sometimes would and sometimes wouldn‚Äôt
I think every second customer I get thinks like that lol and if they use the tap and it declined because the machine wants the pin all sorts of panic sets in!
You don't have to wait til the end to run your card! At least at all the places I've tried. I always run my card as soon as I get up there. The computer like holds on to the info and processes it at the end.
"This makes me so glad I spent the last several years spending money. I've had that experience in college and it was awful.

Haven't had to suffer that in ages."
Just had it done last night for the fucking 7thish time, I sneeze so god damn much it's embarrassing. Especially with a mask on. It's just like, excuse me everyone, I'm obviously disgusting now and I have to go correct that.
"A friend of mine had one done and said it wasn't that bad, so I wasn't expecting the swab to go as deep as it did. Worse than a strep test. The relief when they took it out of the first nostril was nothing compared to the knowledge of what the other was about to endure.

Wear your goddamn masks."
i once had to do like a stomach acid test that lasted 24 hours. I had a tube up my nose all the way down into my stomach with the end taped to my nostril. Every time you eat the tube moves up and down and you can feel every little bite all the way down. So i'd say, eating with that thing, i hope i never have to do that again, just horrible.
Oh fuck. I had to take one for a flight. And this bitch was really angry so she fuken shoves the stick up my nose both nostrils and I scream. She pulls out the now bloody swab and just fuken drops it. She‚Äôs like ‚Äú oh well guess I got to do another one‚Äù before proceeding to ram 2 swabs up both nostrils without me even being ready. It was horrible. The antibody test people were really nice tho and I prefer getting 8 antibody tests to that fuckshit doing one nasal swab.
"depends on who is doing it (similar to most tests and procedures).   


I had one done recently and it was completely fine, only slight discomfort. But i know folks who have had someone with shaky hands who said it was like having their brain tickled."
"Just had it done, thankfully they do the mouth now

Actually they probe the back of the throat

I think that's the first time I've deep throated though and it definitely felt uncomfortable"
Wasn't long for me, despite my uncontrollable instinct to get that thing away from me. Blood tests, on the other hand...
I like the part where there's a mandatory COVID test prior to all doctor appointments and procedures, but they charge you 50 bucks for a test.
I scrolled so far down the thread looking for this comment. I spent that whole 30s fighting the urge to push my doctor away from me.
My job just switched from nasal to throat swab, and to be honest, I thought the nasal was much better. Yeah it tickled and felt like I had to sneeze, but the throat feels like someone is stabbing my tonsils.
"I didn't know what to expect, and merely ""uncomfortable"" was not the word I would use. Thinking about it now I guess it wasn't so bad but when it was happening it hurt and my nose felt weird the rest of the day. Hopefully I won't have to do one again."
"If it makes you feel any better, if the swab was uncomfortable and felt like they were trying to poke your brain tissue, then they used proper technique to obtain a quality sample. 

The swab should be inserted along the nasal septum, just above the floor of the nasal passage, to the nasopharynx, until resistance is felt. The swab should reach a depth equal to the distance from the nostrils to the outer opening of the ear. The CDC recommends leaving the swab in place for several seconds to absorb secretions and then slowly removing the swab while rotating it. Some hospital systems, such as mine, recommend that the swab be rotated several times while it is in the nasopharynx. 

Poor technique can lead to inadequate sample size and quality, which can effect test results."
I crashed a scooter once. Not like a razor scooter but like a vespa. Had about 30 stitches in my arm. The pain i felt when they removed them was the worst part of the whole ordeal. I think i was in  a bit of shock when i got the stitches. But i did have anesthesia but still. Getting them out sucked soo bad!
Especially if it‚Äôs those huge hook needles. I have scars from the freaking needle on either side of my cut!
Oh, man. When I got my wisdom teeth removed, the anesthesia for some weird reason had no effect on me, so they had to put me on laughing gas just to get me through it. I understand all too well why pulling teeth is a torture tactic in many places in the world, and the stitches are a sensation I'll probably never forget
"I like to play pick-up basketball a lot (not really a thing anymore for obvious reason), and one time a couple years ago I took a roughly placed elbow. Not ill intended, the dude made a significantly better effort to jump higher and grab the rebound, I was one of the others under the basket also at the time eye on the ball and going to grab it if it was mistimed on his part. It wasn‚Äôt, he grabs the ball and elbow comes down right on my upper lip.

I rinsed it out, blood in my mouth and on my lip exterior. I was happy I didn‚Äôt lose my upper left incisor, but it just kept bleeding. I tried to examine it myself, and the outside was a tri-wing laceration, inside wasn‚Äôt very clear in my memory. Was in college at the time and went to the health center and they gave me some gauze and said it definitely needed to be stitched up. 

They take me over to the local hospital and I‚Äôm waiting, filling gauze after gauze with blood and I‚Äôm feeling anxiety climbing. I‚Äôm alone during everything, sitting here starting to get dramatic worrying about blood loss, from a lip wound. I finally get called and the PA talks to me, he‚Äôs going to handle everything with some other PA and described the approach, while also confirming my already existent belief that my tooth almost went entirely clean through my upper lip, there wasn‚Äôt much keeping it from being a hole. He‚Äôs telling me how local anesthetic injections swells up the spot and makes it less of an easy area to work with. So INSTEAD they tell me how they‚Äôre going to stab inside my mouth by my cheek bone and have the numbing cascade to the lip (google infraorbital nerve block). 

It was not super pleasant, having the other guy hold my lip out and have the needle put in a not so comfortable place and feeling the anesthetic fluid. Problem was, he started suturing and I winced, since clearly it hurt and he just is astonished. ‚Äú...you can feel that?‚Äù Uh yea. Didn‚Äôt work. He has to finish the first suture, which didn‚Äôt feel so nice, and resorts to the local anesthetic, also feeling each prick, and it worked better but not entirely. Very manageable when stitching the outside, but he also had to put a couple inside and it didn‚Äôt work as well there. Not very pleasant, would not recommend lip stitches."
Idk what doctors your seeing that can suture a laceration shut in 30seconds but I would love to meet them! I have spent many times in the hospital getting lacerations closed and not once has it taken 30seconds even on a 3 stitch quickie..
"YES! This one scares the shit out of me. My girlfriend outs me through it all the time. Like, she wont be feeling great for a few days, or just feel off, craving a weird food etc... and shes all like ""i need a test! Just in case"" Queue my blood pressure and heart rate spiking while i drink a beer and smoke 3 cigarettes waiting for the damn thing. Stressful as fuck."
Other way around for me.  Having 6 years of negative tests.  I still hold my breath just incase, but it's always negative.
It's the worst. The first time I did a pregnancy test was when I was just accepted to uni. It would have not been a good moment, the possible dad was a one night stand (we are still friends though) and he lived 7 hours away and was just accepted to uni too. Would have ruined one of our studies or I would have been a single mom. I was moving to a new city completely alone. I did the test in a library bathroom, peeing into a McDonald's cup! I love kids, but I've never been that relieved to find out I wasn't going to have one
Kids are awesome, they really do enhance your life. I see people say this and I am so confused. Having a kid costs you a lot of things that you enjoy and in exchange you get something that makes you truly happy. I catch myself with the biggest, stupid looking smiles on my face when I think of my son. Just my opinion though I suppose.

I find it extremely anxiety provoking when you have people in your life who encourage you, tell you to put yourself out there, but don't engage with the online content you put out there. I've just spent weeks on a piece, recording, mixing, mastering, writing the score, for 3 views - one was kine to see if it looked all good. It makes ya wanna pack it all in for the shame, but then I remember I'm doing it for me, for my passion, and that helps me keep pushing.
this one always gets me it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm about to hit the post button and think ‚Äúis this really even good??? what if it looks dumb to everyone else but me‚Äù
But don't leave for 15 seconds to do something else or it goes from raw to completely inedible carbon.
If its any consolation the 30 seconds between me trying to find a vein and realising I can't find one and am gonna have to take the tourniquet off and tell you I have to look in another spot is also the longest ever.

"To clarify: it‚Äôs not the pain, or discomfort, it is that I cannot physically watch a needle penetrating skin. Not even in movies. I‚Äôd be a shitty heroine user.

Edit: not to make light of an addiction or someone who has that cross to bear. Just making light of needles poking my skin."
That reminds me the last time I had surgery. I'm in the hospital bed in the pre op room when the nurse comes to start an IV. She couldn't do it, she kept sticking the needle in and out of my arm and wiggling it around trying to find a vein. She did this maybe five times before giving up and getting another nurse. I still have scars up my forearm from nurses trying to get a vein.
I'm the opposite, I close my eyes tense up and want them to go on and git er done. The pain ain't bad enough, not now that Im used to it.
I had to get a numbing shot today. I‚Äôve gotten them before so I knew what to expect but every time she reached for a new iodine swab I was like ‚Äúis it now? What about now?‚Äù because I couldn‚Äôt really see from the way I was positioned.
That reminded me having [dry needling ](https://youtu.be/r0oyHjMnOiY?t=35s)done was certainly the longest I've experienced time.
lol the last time I had my blood drawn she didn't talk me through anything, just wrapped and stabbed it. Worked well for me but I can't imagine what it might be like for a person who's afraid of needles.
"Bruh I'm awful with getting blood out but I have Crohn's so it's necessary every month. Always tapping about and then 1 or 2 tries before success.


Apart from that one time they had to put it in the vein in my hand because they just couldn't get blood anywhere else"
"I once had to be stuck with IV's 3 times before they were successful. 
First three were performed by a clearly scared newbie. 
Finally after she almost managed to get one most the way Back out of the skin and then the last one bubbling up with a huge amount of my blood under the skin did she say, ""um.... excuse me....... "" Very quietly to a clearly veteran nurse did she get shoved aside and told, ""Let me show you how it's done""."
Yeah, some people do need a play by play to feel comfortable, but I don't. Just get it over with. I feel better if I don't know precisely when the stab is coming.
"I've been through it so many times now, it doesn't even bother me.

I was born with epilepsy, so growing up I had to get blood taken at least twice a year for medicine levels. Then any time I had a seizure they'd take my levels again, to see if there was enough medicine in my body, and ask if I had been taking my medicine regularly. If I was taking it regularly and still had low levels, they'd increase my dosage and do more blood work to make sure that the levels were correct after the increase.

Now when I need to get my blood taken, I just sit down, put my arm out, say ""there's a good vein right here"" and point to it, then look away and wait for them to be done."
"The last time I had blood drawn outside of the hospital it took two nurses and a supervisor and 6 sticks to get enough. Last one through back of my dominant forearm worked. 45 min total.

I relayed that story to the dude in the lab at the hospital when I started my next job and he went straight for the back of my arm. 2 min no pain. Woot."
"They do that because there's always that one person who will chew you out for not warning them. Yeah, really.

And as a former phlebotomist (the professional medical blood suckers) I would always get the patient to talk about something else so it's not as bad."
"So my parents didn't like needles, what they did was looked at it while it went in. Apparently a lot of people look away and are awaiting for the prick/poke or whatever and this is where the anxiety probably comes from. Looking at it you know when to expect it.


At least thats what they told me when i was a child and ive kept doing it ever since even though I don't have a fear of needles or anything. Never cried or had an issue with blood work as a child due to it. I think its not the norm though, because the lab techs seem to look at me weird when doing it or ask ""are you sure"" when i respond to them asking if im going to turn away with a no. 

Your mileage may vary however."
I just say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me what you‚Äôre doing. Just tell me when you‚Äôre done‚Äù and I look away before they even do the wipedown
Add in having tiny veins and needing to be stuck at least 2-3 times. My blood pressure is through the roof from anxiety by the time I can leave!
Ive peed on the side of my house before because I just knew I would be able to put the keys in the door in time
Pro tip... try and mentally convince yourself that it will be another 5 minutes before peeing. This seems to work for me as I have that explosive feeling 2 seconds before i unzip my pants to pee. Changing to that mindset seems to make me relax more and not feel like I'm not going to make it.
one time I had a friend over and we were sleeping on the couch but she fell asleep in my spot but sitting up so I still slept there and I saw her move to the other side and i stretched my legs, then i got three leg cramps at once
Omg YES! I had a 10 second long on in my calf at 3 AM. It was super sore the next day, but that was one of the worst pains of my life. It hurt so bad, like way worse than normal.
I AGREE WITH THE COMMENT I AM REPLYING TO. It hurts so bad you want to amputate your leg, and then after a few seconds you‚Äôre totally fine. It‚Äôs so weird.
I get cramp in my leg so bad I have to throw myself out of bed sometimes and the time between realising that it's about to start and my feet hitting the floor and it fading are immensely terrifying and feel far longer than the probably 5 seconds it takes to get out and 20 for it to go back to normal
This is so painful. Once I got a leg  cramp while swimming and I was scared I was going to drown thankfully my friend pulled me to an area I could stand in, so I was ok but still a terrifying experience.
Sounds weird I know, but take rubbing alcohol and pour over the affected area (calf/thigh for me) and rub it in well. I work outside a lot in the summer time and get mildly dehydrated fairly often, and I seem to get leg spasms and cramps the worst when I‚Äôm dehydrated, so I just keep a bottle of alcohol on my night stand in the summer for when I inevitably wake up with calf ripping pain.
I don't know what either of those are like, but I've gotten multiple pubes stuck in the zipper and unknowingly pulled them out with normal movement. That's why I trim them as close as I can

Once I was at the beach, and an oddly shaped piece of sand was hooked on the inside part of my bathing suit (that inner part that‚Äôs kinda like underwear) and my foreskin. I went to the bathroom and pulled down my bathing suit, and AAAAAAAAAA it pulled (luckily not too hard) I spent like fifteen minutes carefully removing it, and it was really difficult because I couldn‚Äôt take off the bathing suit to make way for my hands
Also, accidentally banging your pinky toe against furniture. Hurts like hell for 30 seconds. Then the pain goes away. Fucking weird.
Actually the most painful thing ever. I split my hand open on glass and the skin was hanging off in a flap and I bled for hours, but that pain was nothing compared to the time I zipped my weenie in my zipper.
"I was in a pretty serious car accident when I was little.

The car flipped end over end 1.5 times and ended on its roof. It was due to black ice and an oncoming car that had lost control and was in our lane.

I very distinctly remember the very strange sensation of time slowing to a crawl immediately before and during the accident. My brain didn't have enough time to react, so I was just suddenly in slow-mo and very calm."
Imagine falling to your death. That would be the worst form of this I think. Also, one time I had a dream where my head was going to be cut off, and it felt real, and I was ready to die, but it was terrifying and I had so many questions.
"Yes! Several years ago, I'd tripped on the patio step, and as I stumbled across the driveway toward my car, sort of bent over, my slo-mo thoughts were along the lines of, ""Shit, I'm gonna hit head first, break my neck, & die. Why can't I fall over??! FALL, DAMMIT, FALL!! I'M GONNA DIE!"" But the distance between the step and my car was about 15' at most, and didn't seem like enough distance for there to be enough time to think all of that. I did, though, and then I ""tackled"" (fell into) my car with my right shoulder, which took the brunt of the impact, and broke. Somehow (Grace of God), my body turned enough to not hit head on, but with my right shoulder, though there was a bruise at my hairline above my right eyebrow. X-ray showed no head or neck injury, just the broken shoulder, which was painful enough to deal with.

Ugh! Grade school was the worse time when I was getting over a cold, with that lingering, annoying cough. This was the 70s, and we didn't have water bottles at our desks; our classrooms in first through third grades each had a water fountain in the room, but the cough was still embarrassing, as was having to get up for a drink. I don't know if we were permitted cough drops, but they weren't always effective. In second grade, I decided to try taking deep breaths when I could feel the coughing jag coming on. It actually worked the more I continued with the deep breathing! I guess it had a relaxing effect on my system, and with less coughing, I felt much less embarrassment, as well. Breathing! Who knew?

"Lol, i was in his shoes about 6 1/2 years ago. She was one of the types that you see in movies and tv shows punching and screaming and squeezing.... I deeply regretted telling her she just started when she was only 2 mins in. She said ""WTF, IVE BEEN HERE ON THIS DAMN BED ALL NIGHT!""  The docs gave her so much medication to try and knock her out, they said it would be against the law to give her more, yet she was still kickin my ass!"
You're completely right, I'm not proud to admit I was terrified during the procedure (I didn't realize exactly what was happening until it clicked) and basically crushed the hand of the poor nurse standing next to me (she noticed I tensed up and held my hand, I didn't notice I was squeezing until she told me it hurt her, very few times I've been that embarrased)
Ah ye, that instant kick of adrenaline. Was out cycling and i hit a bus, broke a collar bone but man what a trip. Top 5 highs ive felt.
Similarly, the last 30 seconds of my father's life. My mom and I were in the room when he took his last breaths.  His breathing, which was normal suddenly slowed, stopped, started briefly with a gasp, and then just stopped.  After it stopped, my mother held his hand and told him it was Ok to go. I could describe everything about the hospital room, the weather, and the short walk I made to the nurses station. It all happened in less than a minute, but felt like an hour.
Been there. Done that. In fact, I think I may still be falling from my last accident because I can still see it every time I close my eyes.
I had one go bad on me during the lockdown. Getting it taken out hurt less than any of the other work I‚Äôve had done on my other teeth.

Jeez quit being a talking parrot. As if Trump doesn't lose his train of thought. How is that even a political stance?
"Someone talks shit on trump, the replies: ""omg why do you have to bring politics into everything, reee?!?!"" 

Someone talks about biden: *silence* 

Trump harpies have thin skin."
It blows my mind that you still view this as okay, even as an adult. You weren't a peice of shit for doing it when you were younger because you didn't know any better, but you're certainly a peice of shit for having the time to sort through that and STILL thinking it was a good thing.
Don't be a bully. Even worse don't condone it now your older. You splinter arsed cockney headed cracked up moose.
"> came back down upside right

that's... did you mean ""came back down right side up""? If not, I'm very confused."
It's the same thing for choking. I choked on a piece of chewing gum and it felt like I was struggling for minutes but it was only 30 seconds or less from what I was told after.
"Ooph. Almost drowning is the worst!

Once I  was at a water park w/ my lil bro and my father and we went in the lazy river. Most people used an inner tube but there were none left so I just swam. But since they use jets to keep the water moving and everyone had rafts, I got squished into the side, then I got sucked under the jets and rafts. I honestly thought I was gonna die!

I knew which way was up, but I couldn't get the surface. It was awful and terrifying! Similar thing happened once when I was at the beach. Long story short, a huge wave pulled me in and spun around so much I couldn't figure out which way was up."
This almost exact same scenario happened to me when I went white water rafting in Alaska.  We were in a group and the rafts got pretty close together, and I fell out in some rapids and the raft behind us floated right over me.  I vividly remember being disoriented and feeling the bottom of the raft, realizing I couldn‚Äôt get up to the surface and that I might die.  Shit was scary as hell, and I remember my fianc√©e who was still in the raft was freaking out.  Of course she later fell out and bashed her lip on the way out and was bleeding a bunch.  That was an interesting trip...
"White water rafting in class 9 rapids. My raft hit a huge dip in the water and it dipped me right out of the raft and into the most turbulent eddy I has EVER encountered. As I was being sucked down to the river bottom, I knew this was my day and this was how it was going to happen. I was so terrified I almost panicked. Almost. As I struggled against the unrelenting current, I remember the one and only thing the raft guide said before we embarked. ""If you get stuck in an eddy you must remember to ball up as tight as you can. You do this and you will POP out on top of the water. You don't and try to swim up, you will die. No shit"".  He was right. The ball won the fight against the rapid water. I swam to the bank and made them walk me 2 hours out to the pickup spot. They never questioned me because earlier that same day someone did die, caught in an eddy. Total time under water ? A life time. Reality maybe 8 seconds."
"I had a similar experience rafting with my family in Colorado when I was 12- we were going along and partially went over a rock which caused my dad to get bumped out. But we didn't realize that somehow, one of the straps from our lifejackets got tangled together so when he fell out it jerked me out also. I plunged into the river headfirst and got disoriented under water. I was caught under the raft for a short while (probably seconds, felt like minutes) before our guide hefted me out hulk style by the shoulders of my lifejacket. 

The real heroes were the photographers who managed to get a photo montage of the whole thing happening, frame by frame üòÇ"
"Mate this happened to me when I was a kid in a crowded wave pool, I got pushed under and everyone‚Äôs inflatables made it impossible to get to the surface. People were kicking me and I was panicking, it felt like I was down there ages and seriously close to drowning when I finally planted my feet on the floor and just pushed up with all my strength... and came up through the middle of this fat woman‚Äôs donut ring right next to her fucking choking and gasping.

I remember she looked at me like what the hell do you think you‚Äôre doing and I spluttered ‚Äúuh.. sorry‚Äù and was so embarrassed I just went back under. Luckily the waves stopped then and I was fine but looking back I can‚Äôt believe I was willing to drown myself again out of politeness!"
Flipped out of an inflatable raft in Mexico at the beginning of class 4 rapids, my life jacket didn't save me from getting pulled under for about 15-20 seconds, but my helmet saved me from having my head split open by the bottom of the river.
"Same here when I was younger.  Remember swimming out into some ""cool"" waves, not too deep, just slightly past where I couldn't touch the ground.  All of a sudden I'm standing in about 3 inches of water, slightly confused (where's the water gone?!) and SMASH, big wave.  Slammed me into the seabed.  Even now I remember the power of the water just *twisting* me, keeping me under and smashing me into the floor - I'll be honest, I thought it was game over."
You gotta be joking. There is no way a video game could simulate that. The only thing that does is test your fingers endurance and your hyper imaginative brain
Have you been in a big body of water on an extremely wavy day? I have a cottage on Huron and am a strong swimmer, but on days where the water is crazy I‚Äôm always super cautious as I feel like death is just one wrong move away in there.
I'm fine if i'm just swimming its the panic that sets in when you get to tired to tread and you start taking on water.
I gotta assume that would suck more but i've never been in a situation where i thought i'd die in a fire so ihave no personal experience
I tried that once and could still feel it. I‚Äôm a baby when it comes to pain and teeth, but I‚Äôm a baby when it comes to needles too so when I flinched and the dentist asked if I could still feel it I was like ‚Äú...Nope!‚Äù *cries internally*
I stopped the dentist once because I could feel it and I knew it should‚Äôve been numb. They had a hygienist in the office that was some kind of expert on knowing exactly wear to poke you to get you good and numb. It was near the back of my jaw. She was wild though, but could always get me completely numb in those cases. I‚Äôm a redhead and have heard it can take a little more sometimes. You should always stop them if you can feel it. They can give you more novocaine, but they can‚Äôt take it back so they only give you what they think you‚Äôll need so you‚Äôre not numb all day. It makes for a much better experience so next time tell them.
I was in the middle of a 7.3 earthquake in Mexico recently, it only lasted a couple of seconds but it was really freaky. I can‚Äôt even imagine how weird it would feel for 19 seconds, and in the dark
8.8 in chile back in 2010. I thought the earth was going to open up and swallow me. There was a pretty heavy box on top of my closet (easily four meters away from me) and that shit landed right next to my head while I was sleeping. My parents bolted out of their rooms to try to get to where my little brothers were but they couldn't walk, the earthquake was too strong. Hearing my youngest brother (4 years old at the time) screaming and crying for our mom while she was in the hallway unable to move just telling him it was going to be over soon and to cover his head has to be the most traumatic thing I've ever witnessed, I can't even imagine what was going through my parents heads.
">Even getting to the door frame after having to pry the door open to get into it

<pedantic>

Just wanted to mention this isn't recommended anymore.  'Cause the door can smash into you repeatedly.

So only use a doorframe if it doesn't have a door in it.  Otherwise, get under some sturdy furniture."
"In Virginia, about a decade ago, we had a 5.5 earthquake that lasted for like 20 seconds. 

Nothing major, damage relatively minimal. But it was a small town in central Virginia. My mom and I had no idea what was going on, cause we hadn't had an earthquake worse than 3.5 in our lifetimes. The entire region was confused. I thought we were gonna die if we didn't hang on to the kitchen table"
It's weird, living in a high risk area (Alaska) for all my life has made me really used to it. When it happens it hardly has any effect on me now.
I lived 10 miles from Northridge and I slept through it. Ironically, I can't sleep for more than 15 minutes at a time now. I always wonder just how crazy it was to experience that.
I had originally scrolled past the first comment since I've never been in an earthquake and honestly don't know. Reading this made me go back and upvote it. Jesus that sounds scary...
i have experienced a 6.4 earthquake in Albania last year and it lasted up to one minute.i dont know if i will ever go through a more traumatic experience in my life.I woke up at 4am to everything shaking and my parents yelling to go to the door.i just stood at my bed looking at nothing imagining it was the end of my life
Yes! I was living in north Hollywood at the time and I remember how long it felt while shaking harder and harder and getting louder. You never think about how loud earthquakes are until you‚Äôre in one. Not only is the earth shaking but every object in it is as well. I had all my cassettes stacked on my dresser and they started shooting out and hitting me in bed. And as my bedroom window was vibrating loudly I just knew it was going to burst. Since it was around 4-5a I was out of it. So on top of time moving so slow, I was also a bit confused. What I remember the most was that the earthquake was just getting more and more intense, I really thought it would end with an explosion. I was about 16, I usually run to the doorway for cover but I was so disoriented and scared that I just screamed. It was dark too. Luckily our house wasn‚Äôt too damaged. That was the scariest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. You don‚Äôt feel safe after, every time there‚Äôs an after shock you think it‚Äôs going to be another full on earthquake. And you don‚Äôt trust the ground you walk on to be stable. But the sound is what gets me every time. So violent.
I was 6 and living in Arleta when that hit. I still have vivid memories of the whole house rumbling, books flying, my dad kicking into gear to get all the kids outside. I also remember the natural gas explosion. My mom was at work and we didn‚Äôt have news from her for a long time because everything was down. Absolutely terrifying.
I remember this. Was it really 19 seconds?!? I thought it was a whole minute. Case in point, I guess.
"The first several quakes I experienced were either very mild or very brief, so the longer ones, later on, caught me unprepared. But I read somewhere that you can maximize your short-term psychological stability -- once you've taken care of proper positioning, obv -- if you stay vaguely distracted from the actual source of unease (the shaking); and one way to do that is to ""scold"" the quake itself, ostensibly to ""make it stop.""

True, it sounds silly; but it helps keep you calm as the event passes, because you're doing something your brain perceives as more useful than just waiting and being scared."
You described that Northridge quake perfectly. Felt like it would never end. The aftershocks gave me PTSD the rest of that day...
"I experienced that one too (from the part of the PNW that is Canada) and was in high school at the time. It was the one and only time we had a ""real"" earthquake or fire drill, and we had to get under our desks, though it ended up not being so bad for us - it was still the biggest one I had ever felt. A beaker got cracked in the science lab which was the only damage."
"It was a creepy quake. I was an adult and was working on a building we own- my husband was using a table saw and thank God didn't lose a body part. I was painting and freaked out and put my father in law in a panic chokehold pretty much. 

Our entire apartment in downtown Seattle was reduced to rubble inside. Knee deep smashed glass pretty much (RIP four showcases of French art deco glass). The chimneys all around us had gone over- we were on an especially jello-y area of fill dirt I guess."
I was in high school just north of Seattle at the time and it was wild. I was in the restroom during lunch when I felt the floor shake; my school had two stories so I assumed students were jumping around upstairs for some weird reason when suddenly I heard the screams. I poked my head out of the restroom and saw a few students running down the hall, and all of the light fixtures swaying. I thought ‚Äúwelp, this is a thing that‚Äôs happening‚Äù and proceeded to stuff myself under a shelf. I‚Äôll never forget how strange the floor felt - not so much shaking, but like it was rolling back and forth over a bunch of marbles. One of my friends who was walking down the hall at the time swore she saw the floor tiles move like ocean waves.
"[Here's mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KivcaxceBU).

I have been in many, many earthquakes and there was even one a week before the 3/11 big one that was big but still relatively short, the usual few seconds.

I started filming this at least 30 seconds after the shaking started when it became obvious is wasn't stopping.  The peak occurred when I say ""We may not make it out of this""."
This shit!! Found this out a few weeks ago and it blew my fucking mind. I almost kind of .... miss getting the hiccups now.
"‚ÄúI would hate to inconvenience them by messing up their scan, I‚Äôll just pass out in their giant donut.‚Äù ü§î

Edit: During my last MRI they let me listen to music, and they told me to stay as still as possible... but they let me listen to ‚ÄúJump Around - House of Pain‚Äù. 

They played themselves."
I had one about a month or so ago now and they put iodine in my iv and trying to stay still while it feels like you're peeing yourself was probably the weirdest thing about my emergency stay.
"It was worse for me because instead of ""hold your breath"" they said ""I need you to stop breathing."" It was my first CT scan so I didn't expect it and I was so terrified that I actually started breathing faster"
"Wait...what? I work at a hospital and our machine has the soothing lady voice that goes ""Please breathe in and hold. Release."""
The contrast dye being injected is worse. That flushed feeling that flows down to your toes makes me queasy.
"When I had a CT scan the ""hold your breath"" signal was a very loud automated voice saying ""STOP BREATHING."" That shit was terrifying."
"*Beathe. In.*

*Breathe out.*

*Hold. Your breath.*

*...*

*...*

*...*

*Relax.*

Repeat ad nausium."
In regular x-ray, there's a way the tech can rotor (basically, get the wheels spinning) and then tell the patient to take a breath in, and then the machine is already ready to take the exposure in a split second. I always do this for my patients but some of my co-workers don't and it drives me nuts. Sometimes I'll hold my breath while the patient does so I kinda I know how they are feeling.
Holy shit. I‚Äôm a nurse who has taken 10,000 patients to CT scans and I never once realized until now that the machine‚Äôs pre recorded voice message that tells them to breathe in doesn‚Äôt specify how long they‚Äôll have to hold their breath. Never saw the other POV until now
As someone who recently had several ct and mri scans, I found the part where they ask you to just breathe normal to be more difficult. Shit, how does breathing work again?
I got lucky when I did mine (twice) it had a count down on the tube. Above me. But that 10 Seconds still felt long
"2 hours in to a 4 hour MRI
""hole your breath""...15 m later, pull me out for a half minute while the second contrast takes affect and i go
""uh..I'm itching"" i broke out in hives."
"I have to get MRI scans to observe some tumors I have in my brain and spine.  Normally it takes around two and a half hours two do the three segments of the spine and the brain.  However, I recently had a cochlear implant installed, so they have to go super slow on them.  

Last time I took over five hours in the machine, and I only had half of the scans done.

I have massive pain in my hips, probably because of some tumor compressing something, and just laying for hours without moving is fucking horrid"
This was me with what turns out to be four slipped discs earlier this week. I could feel my lower back spasming (lying down is currently the wooooooorst) but kept fighting it as hard as I could. It was one hell of an ab workout, at least!
"Thats a usual proplem with patients. They usually don‚Äôt understand that during imaging keeping the position and not moving is very important. If you move the chances are high the images aren‚Äôt good, or not easily compareable to the other images already made. Then we have to repeat the sequence, making it more time investing for the technicans and the patients, it they also just want to make it as fast as possible for the patients too because they know it‚Äôs not really comfortable. Also not moving on their own when they think nothing is happening rightnow. 

I have seen multiple patients during radiotherapy move when they think the machine doesn‚Äôt do anything from their perspective, if the medical staff doesn‚Äôt do anything after that they would just apply a big amount of radiation to a place, maybe organs, where it shouldn‚Äôt be applied to. It‚Äôs like the patient would move during a surgery while you are precisely cutting a specific spot."
Even though with the headphones on the noise is still quite loud, the repetitiveness of it is quite... reassuring? I didn't nap but I can kind of understand how someone else might have been able to.
That dye just made me feel so very nauseous....when they put me back in, I kept laying there thinking 'I'm going to vomit, I'm going to vomit'. Worse as it was a scan of my head and they had my head in this stupid head cage thing so I knew getting up quickly wouldn't be an option either.
Yup.  I've had way too many scans in the last year and seconds feel like minutes.  Gangrene was the worst.  Trying to hold still while your entire nervous system is screaming that you're literally dying is not a good time for anyone involved.
Yes, you're thinking of a CT scan. Specifically a CT scan with contrast to see the path of the fluid inside your body. We tell everyone that the contrast being injected gives you a warm feeling and some people have the feeling that they urinated themselves. It's definitely an uncomfortable feeling.
"The donut radiation machines (CT) scans are usually very short. Only a few minutes. How are you able to fall asleep that fast? 
Or do you mean an MRI which usually takes 15 minutes or longer (it‚Äôs the one which looks more like a long donut tunnel and does the hammer noises)"
The techs are very happy if you are able to hold still, believe me, there are many who can‚Äôt take it due to uncomfortable position or pain caused by the illness. Sometimes even fixating is necessary.
I had major claustrophobia and couldn‚Äôt last my first time, so I had to be sedated lmao. It was so unpleasant.
I feel that.  I was in the hospital for six weeks with gangrene and sepsis.  After half a dozen or so dressing changes I was giving instructions to the first time nurses.  Had to get it done fast and right the first time because once they shot me up with ketamine I was just gone.
tbh if i have that bad of a diarrhea i wont care about waking everybody up. They're probably gonna have a great laugh and its easier to explain and apologize and whatnot than to endure that extra pain.
I find in these moments my best move is a sort of clench and thrust forward movement. I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs what a kegal feels like, sort of
I don't fuck with dairy anymore... I can't look at cheese without getting feeling like I'm going to spray hot soup.
Oh nah I don‚Äôt care about the judgement aspect, but I live with two of my buddies and nobody likes being woken up to the sounds of *viscosity*
"Good, stay away from food poisoning. It can range from mild to hellish. A bit of diarrhea and or cramps isn‚Äôt so bad compared to explosively vacating both ends at the same time for long(they always feel long) periods of time.

One time my friend had food poisoning and he just covered the floor in vomit. It was chicken nuggets and orange soda and it was so hard to clean up. He apologized repeatedly while I purged the bathroom of his episode and reassured him of his involuntary innocence in such a crime.

Another time I had it and I spent the next hour or so just filling both the sink and toilet which were thankfully close enough to each other so the floor remained clean.

We both begged for death in those instances.

I can not recommend avoiding food poisoning enough."
"I just cut to the chase and throw my change on the floor before apologising profusely and rolling around in an attempt to pick it up. 

It's inevitably going to happen anyway."
"I did that yesterday, and when I pulled out my wallet from my pocket, all of the loose change came flying out of my pocket.

Luckily I was at home when the latter happened, but some loose change fell beneath the sofa."
Same, whether it's cash or a credit/debit card, I pay, throw the change or card and receipt in my pocket, sort it out when I get in my car.
exactly what i do, but the problem is everything gets scrunched up and you might lose a dollar or two out the door. it‚Äôs all just a mess.
"I like people like you. On two separate occasions I have found $100 bills just lying on the ground and other times have found several $20s, $10s, and many $5$ and $1s.

If I see the person drop it I will always give it back but money on the ground and nobody around, finders keepers. Fortunately on both times I found the hundreds, the unlucky person was long gone."
Thank you. People in front of me fucking around at the register may be my greatest pet peeve. I think I hate it more when someone waits until the cashier is completely done ringing their items to then begin the process of pulling out their purse/wallet/whatever. Does it surprise you that you have to pay? Be efficient as possible for those around you is all I'm saying.
I usually have leggings on and wear a jacket. The summer is so bad because I fucking hate carrying a purse so I have NOWHERE to put my change. I just try to balance my change and all my purchases and then just run to my car to dump it all on the seat üòÖ
"*lie to myself that I'll put it in my wallet later. So no I'm not doing that.

And the next guy who still has to wait for his stuff to get scanned anyway starts getting in your space to pressure you to leave. And you feel anxious because not only am I feeling the pressure to finish and leave, now this guy is standing 3mm from me at the same time so I lose fine motor dexterity and struggle to get the bills in the wallet, so it takes even more time."
Good plan. Could you imagine every cashier counting their till everytime you made a purchase? Sort it out at end of day üëç
Yeah like a normal human? Thanks. I cant stand waiting for some ocd clown to re organize his shit after fumbling around with change in their palm and then spinning dollar bills around faced before putting it his wallet.... Putting it in his back pocket.... Grabbing the bags... Folding the recipt... Man get the fuck out of the way
My standard is to wait til they move on but then some asshole behind you thinks you're not going and swoops in. Same shit with driving. I wanna leave room but if I do, people all swoop in like crazy and I have to keep braking.
Good! I hate impatient people like this! Would it really kill you to take the extra 3 seconds to wait til they turn to walk away? And then they have the nerve to huff as if you inconvenienced them! Bitch I'll pay one item at a time if I want
"Were the products you didn't ring up not a good enough sign that you weren't done???

I'm practically unique in the way I don't crowd the crossway between the aisles and the registers. Only once was I standing in an aisle (not blocking the crossway) and some guy 2 people behind me asked if I was waiting in line. There was one person's between us, and two people behind him, all single file in a line pointing toward the checkout registers.

I was there at the front of the aisle, basket in hand, facing the registers and waiting for the person in front to move forward and start the checkout, but there was a 4 foot gap. I didn't even know how to respond to his question, except nod and say ""yeah.""

I still don't know why society doesn't think about leaving space for people to move about and actually shop."
"Its sooooo much better parking in places that have an app to pay. Especially when its shitty weather.

Just sit in your cosy warm car, and sort payment there. No need to piss about with ancient pay machines"
Especially when they have to face and organize their bills. Do that shit on your own time, asshole. Nobody in line cares what way your bills face, go out to your car and take care of it afterwards like a considerate adult would.
Some places still have the old style machines, where you have to swipe/insert your card. Obviously the cards hate that, so spaz out a bit and won‚Äôt read properly
Dump the coins from the top of the bills into a hand. Put those coins in your pocket. Quickly fold the bills in half, and put them in your wallet if you sill have it out, or in your pocket if you already put your wallet away. Take the receipt and put it in your pocket. All of that should take 10 seconds and if it takes you much longer, you are the problem.
My first time apparently my uterus just . . . Squeezed it back out again? So she had to get a whole new one and start over. I almost told her not to bother because I didn't think I could take it again. But I've gotten it done two more times since then. It is ultimately worth it for me. Though it does make me wonder whether I'll be able to face the pain of labor if I ever do get pregnant. It's gotta be worse, right?
Nooooo that sucks! I had a few IUDs and hated every single one of those procedures. Definitely much worse than a pap smear.
Omg this sounds so horrible. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you! Getting mine put in was so painful. And then I read something the other day talking about how getting it taken it out was even more painful and now I am terrified of when I eventually have to have it taken out.
As a female who has never had one, this sounds like the pill is a much better option, and a lot les mortifying lol  tf you mean ‚Äúhad to re-dilate me‚Äù?  ü§¢ü§¢
I don't have any of your parts and I'm sitting here fucking squirming that sounds so painful/uncomfortable/stressful.
"I had an endometrial biopsy the same day. The IUD was a party in comparison, haha. 

And yet I‚Äôll do it again in 4ish years because no babies!"
My strings are retracted. I‚Äôm dreading getting it removed in a year since they have to actually open my cervix to retrieve it.
I had to bring my 6 week old baby with me while getting mine placed. Juuuuust as the midwife was dilating me my baby woke up and started just screaming. And he is usually quite calm. She asks if I want her to pick him up and hand him to me before she places the IUD. I'm like nah, let him scream let's get this shit done üòê. I felt awful letting him cry but my cervix was kinda hurting and he already put me through the wringer for labor so...
Fuck that entire situation, holy shit. I‚Äôm uncomfortable just getting a Pap smear, I think if someone tried to dilate my cervix with no pain management whatsoever I would kick them in the face
I had 2 doctors try to place one at a family clinic (and this was my 2nd one) and both gave up because I just wouldn't dilate. I had to go to a specialist then and she had no sympathy for me and harumphed when I screeched as it went in.) Then I was wobbly/faint getting up and had to lay back down for 10 minutes and she pursed her lips and tutted as checked on me twice. It made me realize that many women must go through some awful stuff if that was small potatoes.
"For my 2nd one, which was 6 weeks after the birth of my daughter (and I was still bleeding), I had everything all prepped and the doctor fumbled it and dropped it on the floor. And had to leave the room because she didn't have a backup. When I left, there was a 12"" diameter puddle of blood on the floor."
I didn't get dilated when I tried to get one put in... I couldn't handle the pain of it but now I think I understand why.
My doctor KNOCKED MY IUD OUT with her hand one second after she placed it the first time ..... we started all the way over again with the dilation and everything after she finished apologising. Not pleasant, not pleasant at all.
My second placement the doctor failed to cut all the way through both strings when trimming. Pulling the scissors out pulled the IUD out.  Had to wait for them to get a new sterile one to insert
My doctor placed mine and asked for the scissors to cut the string. The nurse didn't have any and had to leave the room and go find some. Excruciating.
My doctor wanted her fellow/intern/baby doctor to see if he could test the placement of my IUD with his hand. He rummaged around there while standing up like he was looking for his keys.
Oh my god the duckbill thing TWICE???? In one day????? I screamed so loud when that was used on me ‚òπÔ∏è
I read the first comment as IED, and then your comment confused me to no end. What kind of explosive device requires a doctor, and where the fuck did he put it.
my wife had one, and eventually had an allergic reaction to the latex or whatever it is made out of. It worked its way out
No thank you. I had such a bad experience with the pill and nuvaring. I am terrified of anything getting implanted
"> Three attempts later and 12 years later.

I'm no expert but that seems like a long time in the stirrups."
As a guy, I‚Äôm feeling a bit woozy just reading this entire IUD thread. But everyone is also saying it‚Äôs worth it... Is it really, though??
What‚Äôs it like having it being taken out? They told me when they put mine in that taking it out is nothing. But that insertion was... oof, like everyone else has described it, pretty much.
Yeah, I've had the procedure a few times now so I always think it can't be as bad I remember. . . But it is! Definitely the worst pain I've ever felt. It makes me fear childbirth because I assume that must be even worse.
I passed out from the pain as well. Why don‚Äôt they offer more pain killers/reducers??? It‚Äôs the worst thing I‚Äôve ever experienced medically
Same. I have an extremely high pain tolerance but I have noticed it doesn't seem to apply to anything involving the uterus.
"The more stories I hear like this, the more I think I'm the only person in the world who didn't feel much pain during the procedure. I went to planned parenthood and the PA who did it pretty much does only that all day long, so maybe she was just really good at it by then. Because it only hurt for a couple seconds, and the pain was mild enough that I was able to keep playing sudoku on my phone during it. I took one pain pill about 15 mins before the procedure.

I got the paragard, but I'm not sure the brand makes a difference in the pain. It must just be different for different people. I do hope that stories of pain don't make people reconsider the IUD if they previously wanted to get one. It's not a universal experience."
"YES. I was even okay kinda with the pain? It was definitely a sensation I had never ever felt before and I think my brain was confused about how to interpret the signals. But after the doctor left the room and I slowly sat up to get dressed, I almost passed out on the floor. I had to kinda crawl back to the table and the whole time I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúWHERE IS THE DOCTOR IM PANICKING COME BACK BUTTON?!?‚Äù 

And then I felt like shit all day. But hey, no baby :)"
This comment thread made me remember I was planning on getting an IUD but also is scaring me sooo much. I‚Äôve never had a kid or had painful period cramps so I can‚Äôt even imagine what the pain would be like.
"Its such bullshit they just give you ONLY an ibuprofen and call it a day. 

I'm demanding a sedative  or actual painkiller when mine is taken out. There is literally no reason to put me through that much pain."
I've also heard that it can affect the vagus nerve, so it's probably not your lack of toughness that made you pass out.  :)
I've given birth too and I'd rather do that again than experience an IUD insertion again. That was NOT pleasant.
Holy moly!! My first was relatively painful (especially the cramps afterwards), but the second time around it just felt like an uncomfortable pinch. I‚Äôve yet to have kids so I‚Äôm hoping that my pain tolerance is decent!
oh no im getting mine in a few days and I was kinda chill about it but after reading this I'm freaking out
Really? I had bad cramps as a teen and I thought the IUD was easier. Maybe it hurts less for some people?
"Why do they not prescribe pain medication for this procedure?? 

As I was writhing in pain for 6 hours, all I could think is ""I bet I'd get pain killers if this procedure were ever done on men."""
I had to be put under to have mine replaced. My strings had gone missing (?) and my gyno poked and scraped around for 7 minutes!!! without pulling the old one out. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and had to be fully put under for the replacement. Still better than having a period every month
If nothing else, bring someone with you to drive you home and ask for Valium (or some other sedative; your doctor knows best, obv.). My doctor actually offered it, and it made the entire experience a lot more tolerable. I still felt it, but I wasn't quite as freaked out the whole time. I wish I'd brought someone with me when I had it removed (it had attempted to expel and was stuck in my cervix). THAT visit was awful.
You can ask.  I do think that legally there are some procedures (IUDs included) where if you ask for a local, they'll do it.  I don't think they'll completely put you out, since general is far more risky.
Lots of doctors will do that!  I'm a terrible gynecological patient and I hyperventilate as soon as my legs are in the stirrups (I think I have a teeny bit of PTSD from an abortion I had at 18 that was a less-than-pleasant experience). I had to get a colposcopy and biopsy early this year and sobbed on the table for 5 minutes straight before I could put my pants back on.  Luckily after that I found a obgyn that's amazing and we've managed to get me through pap smears/general checkups successfully now, but anything past that (my IUD insertion and follow up colposcopies) I get sedated for.  I just have to make sure my spouse is there to drive me home after.
I was put under general anasthesia. Second time without. I prefer being awake while having it done, it's not that bad. It's just like super cramps and a punch to the stomach and then aches for a while after,  but once the first blow is over, it is completely manageable.
I asked for some local anesthetic (it was a pill I inserted before the appointment) and it was still a lot of pressure but so much more bearable. Highly recommend
Not everyone experiences a lot of pain. I think those of us who did are more likely to complain about it on the internet. Ask the doctor about a local anaesthetic or taking a sedative like valium (if you do this you'll need a ride home). A lot of people in this thread, including me, still say it's worth it.
Girl take some meds beforehand. Even if it's just a motrin or tylenol and don't forget to BREATHE! You'll be okay!
I was panicky as shit, and have painful periods generally, but having the iud inserted was ok for me. The tenaculum hurt, but the sounding and insertion went pretty smoothly. I didn‚Äôt get the choice of having local anaesthetic. I‚Äôd really recommend reading and watching people talk about their good experiences as well, the fear can make the whole process even more shit.
Take a lot of painkillers and valium if you can beforehand. To be completely honest, I would advice people against getting one because it was so traumatising for me, even though my doctor gave me meds to dilate and put it in really fast and precise. I just hope I'm very sensitive and that it isn't like that for everyone. I did not get any anesthetics though. Ask your doctor if they can put in some local anesthetics and when you should take meds beforehand. I'm not trying to be negative but it was just so horrible for me üôÅ
I just had one put in a few hours ago and tbch it's not as bad as I remember.  If you try to relax (bring music with you, deep breathing) while they get prepped, that helps a lot.  I had a hot compress (the kind where you pop the little thing inside it and it heats up) that I put on my lower abdomen and it made a world of difference.  Good luck in your appointment!
Everyone experiences it differently so it's hard to tell what it will be like for you but don't panic about it being awful for everyone. I got my first one in last year and it really wasn't too bad for me, taking paracetamol before and trying to stay calm and relaxed helps. Also make sure you've just got a chill couple of days planned after cause it'll be like you're on a bad period so you'll just want to lie about. But it's honestly so worth it, not having to worry about birth control at all and knowing it's one of the most effective methods out there is great
"I had mine inserted a few months after birth and it was fine. Never heard about the pain until doc asked if I took any painkillers. I said ""no"", to which she just raised an eyebrow. 

But the insertion wasn't so bad, I had to breathe through it a bit (it was sharp-ish pain but not too bad), definitely better than my usual vomiting menses cramps. Or another birth."
Bring someone you trust with you, remember to breath... Everything will be fine, and no baby for years! It will be worth it :)
"That is my nightmare! You are so so tough. I would be traumatized by that. It blows my mind how many of us are saying ""worst pain ever"" and ""totally worth it"" at the same time - but it is!"
Omg. This whole post is a nightmare. I‚Äôm getting mine taken out next Friday. Why am I reading these üò≠üò≠üò≠
Thanks for recognizing that.  Takes a lot to really acknowledge pain women go through so that we can live in this world with peace of mind and security for a short-term childless future.
I'm also a guy so no real experience here, but it's basically a little T shaped device that goes inside the uterus. Google IUD and you can see some pictures, dont worry it should be a fairly safe search.
Its a little T shaped piece of plastic or copper depending on the brand. They use a speculum to open up your vagina and they take a long applicator that the IUD is in and they slide it up into your cervix and pop the IUD in. If you bleed they patch you up with liquid bandaid.
And the package that the IUD comes in is like a foot long. The IUD itself is just like a small umbrella party pick. But unless your doctor informed you beforehand, you will get quite nervous about it...
I've been postponing getting it out for a while now because I was so traumatised. I didn't take any painkillers before they put it in. It's rather go back to my debilitating period cramps and iron deficiency than insert a new one. It also hurt really bad for like three months afterwards, but the week after getting it was fucking horrible. I've always been perfectly fine with gynaecologists and doctors but now I'm so scared when getting examined that I get hysterical and try to kick them away. I have no idea how I will get through taking it out. I'm scared shitless of it, but I don't want it inside me anymore. I'm terrified and I don't know what to do.
I got mine replaced in January and it was NOTHING like the first time. I had my husband drive me, took a Xanax and ibuprofens 30 minutes before we got there. I didn't even have cramps afterwards. I cried thinking about the replacement before I got it done.
I expected the worse since the insertion was so damn painful, but I only had very short cramps and discomfort when mine was taken out!
It really depends on the person. When I hear horror stories about the pain, I generally like to reply so that people who are considering it as the best option for them don't get scared off by the idea that bad pain is a guarantee. I took a pain pill about 15 minutes before the procedure and the pain was really very mild. I was able to keep playing on my phone during it. There was a nurse in the room who I think was there to hold my hand and help me through it, but she didn't need to. (I'm not bragging, just relaying my own experience so folks reading will know that there's a possbility for a non-horrific experience if they decide to get it!)
I fainted in the waiting room afterward when I was setting up my next appointment. Felt totally fine before it other than cramps. Messing with the uterus like that can cause vasovagal responses pretty easily, apparently.
Offer a local anesthetic or something if possible. Be honest about the fact that many people say it hurts, some that it hurts a LOT. Explain what you're doing before and during. Idk about others, but having that knowledge of what's going on makes it better. Getting mine was no joke the worst pain I've ever experienced. I almost fainted. Would have killed for something for the pain beforehand.
Do it as quickly as possible (obviously while being careful. Explain fully to the patient beforehand what the process is. When I got my first one the worst part was the measurement tool. Then she just popped the new one in in like a second.  The last two I‚Äôve gotten with a new doc have been awful because she leaves the plastic tube in me for like a whole minute while she places it. So if you can avoid doing that within reason, do it. Also offer juice afterward so they don‚Äôt faint. My first doc did this and it was definitely helpful!  And leave them alone for 10 minutes for them to recover. Then check on them again before they leave to make sure they don‚Äôt faint when they get up.
"Make sure they take an ibuprofen before their appointment.

EDIT: Ooh, and deep breathing techniques helps tons. My doc had me exhale when she placed it."
"My male family doctor failed to place 2 IUDs and I ended up having a referral to a specialist. You can read more details if you look up my most recent comment prior.  I didn't hold it against him but I felt bad because I apparently didn't dilate at all even with the misoprostol. After the first try he got another person, a nurse practitioner, to try and she also couldn't place it.

My friend's doctor gave her a Valium to take an hour beforehand because she was so nervous. She seemed to be fine with that. My doctor only gave me misoprostol and told me to take 200mg of ibuprofen. I don't know how common it is to do that but she's a nervous person anyway and has panic attacks while I do not. I wish I had something like that on board though, even though I know it would mean not driving there or back. After the 2 failures I WAS nervous and yet the specialist got it right in. Still hurt like a burn but only for about a minute."
Awesome of you to ask!  I got mine removed and replaced today without any anesthetic or drugs, and my doctor put a cold pack under the back of my neck, and a warm one on my lower abdomen.  The cold one I didn't notice so much (she said it was to keep me distracted), but the hot one made all the difference.  As she did the procedure, she told me what she was doing, and brought in an assistant so I could hold her hand.
Not everyone‚Äôs experience is terrible, and hormonal IUDs can help with period cramps and have a lower dose of hormones than oral contraceptives. The unknown aspect of the level of pain is frankly terrifying though, so it definitely makes sense to stick with what works for you
Those are the worst especially when it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs kid and even if it‚Äôs not your fault I‚Äôm still having a panic attack like oh my gosh this kids going to start crying and I hardly know this person
"I've had this happen to me as a grown adult, except the eventual scream was more of an ""AAAUUUGGGHHHH!"" because it felt like my tailbone got shoved through my skull when I hit the floor."

I remember playing with my dog when I was about 13 (big staff/pit cross) I'd throw a ball and then sprint away when she wasn't looking and she'd sprint after me. One time she ran straight into the back of my legs and I landed flat on my back, the fall plus the speed I was running plus the speed I was rotating from the dog taking my legs from under me combined was harder than anything I'd felt. I couldn't get a breath for what felt like forever, my friend even sprinted home to get help and it wasn't till he got back I could breath semi regularly again"
My first was a completely uncomplicated vaginal delivery, absolutely no reason to think anything was wrong. My daughter decided to take in her surroundings a bit before testing out her lungs, and it was the longest moment of my life. The doctor was holding her, and it couldn't have been more than 30 seconds if it was even that long, but she was just *so* purple and *so* still. I can't imagine how long that pause must be in a high risk situation.
I work at a childcare center. When a kid falls I usually say ‚Äúoh! That looked like fun!‚Äù And fall myself. They think it‚Äôs hysterical
"Actually came here to say ""the last thirty seconds of holding your breath""; seems like as good a place as any."
Ugh, I was once waiting in a line outside a public bathroom, and this middle-aged lady starts jiggling the door handle. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYah, it‚Äôs occupied,‚Äù and she goes, ‚ÄúSometimes they need a reminder that people are waiting.‚Äù There‚Äôs no moral to this story. It just made me mad.
"Once I ate some fried chicken and then went for a drive. I had about fourteen seconds of warning that I needed to stop. Got inside, only one stall worked. Fine. But then... Two women came in waiting their turn. And they waited. The entire. Time. I could barely walk past them. I don't know how both of them literally waited through that. It. Was. Not. Good.

So if you read this and this happened to you between Carrollton and Florence KY, I'm apologizing with everything in me üòÇ"
"I once thought this guy in the bathroom was actually dead, because I waited 10 minutes and didnt even hear him move. then I said something, he started yelling at me, ""let me take my shite in peace!"" I timed it, took 15 minutes for him to finish from then, he was on his phone most of the time (I could see), and he was so aggro on leaving the bathroom I thought he might attack me."
"If its messy and they trynna clean I wont judge.

What i dont get is how poop gets *outside* of the toilet? Like, i mean..."
"I had the displeasure of being in this situation after eating something bad while on vacation in Spain and then dealing with bad stomach cramps and having to poop my guts out about once every 90 minutes. It happened toward the end of the trip and one of the most stressful moments of my adult life was having to take a quick poop during the short layover in Paris on the way back to the USA. I was literally dancing around in the airport trying not to poop myself while trying to get to the toilet closest to my departure gate and then having all of like 8 minutes to do the business as my plane was already boarding.

Also, I feel sorry for the poor gentleman who attempted to enter stall after I was done with it. I was watching him in the mirror while quickly washing my hands and the look of total disgust on his face when the stench hit him is something I'll always remember."
"The ones at the laundromat say 28, I set my timer for 28, it goes off, I check, they say 4. Liars and cheats, the lot of them.

Edit: u/tamidala points out:
>You're probably overloading your machine or have items that absorb a lot of water in there (blankets, denim etc). It'll adjust the timer if it thinks there's still too much water inside."
Mine will suddenly add on extra time towards the end of the cycle, but it turns out that it does that when it slows down to handle a heavy and unbalanced load.
I timed mine once, the 51 minute cycle actually takes an hour and two minutes.  My 55 min dryer cycle finishes before the washer does.
Mine said 1 minute for 20 minutes. I was waiting to move it to the dryer before bed and I was extremely tired
A lot of newer ones in laundromats and college dorms do. Idk about ones in homes because mine is old.
"Even the digital display has to be extremely wrong.  It beeps songs for you when its done and can make all these crazy micro adjustments and do an anti allergy wash - but in the end they still cant make the time estimate correct.

Its a conspiracy."
"Never thought of it like that. I suppose it‚Äôs because tv shows are designed to cater to that ad break. Ie stories are normally told in two parts, usually with a cliffhanger in the middle to keep you around for part 2. A bit like an interval in a play. 

YouTube videos aren‚Äôt like that, the ads can happen in the middle of a sentence so it‚Äôs more shocking to the viewer. You actually recognise it as an advert rather than an ad break."
"The 5-second ads are tolerable for me. It's the 15-second unskippable ads that piss me off.

It wouldn't be so bad if it happened when the video I'm watching had opportune moments and didn't just happen mid-sentence."
I never watched it though. I muted the TV and went to refill my drink. The fade to black for commercial break was always long enough for me to grab the remote and shut that shit down.
"It's a form of conditioning. As a kid, ad breaks were just a thing. Something inevitable that you couldn't avoid. You hated them, but knew it couldn't be any other way. 

When videos first became big online, ads were not a thing. Just watch the video, watch the next. Then Netflix; endless watching with no ad breaks. 

So now you're less tolerant of ads online. Because you know they're unnecessary. You know it can be better and has been better."
"There are ads on YouTube? 

My new/ reformatted computer routine is:

Install os
Install Firefox
Install adblock plus
Install antivirus"
Commercials weren't so bad growing up, but now they sometimes speed up old shows to fit in more commercials. I can't stand watching anything with ads these days
I get more frustrated watching an unskippable 5 second ad, than watching a longer ad that I can skip after 5 seconds
I think this is probably because of the fact it's easy to pause a YouTube video, to go get a drink, go to the toilet etc, where with TV, especially old ones, you couldn't do that, hence the 2 minute break for you to do what you need.
"I think YouTube isn't bad with the ads let alone people going crazy over them. Firstly the amount is kinda up to the uploader, and they choose where which is why they're not mid sentence. 

Then for the ones that do have middle of the video ads at the worst(for the dozen of channels i watch) every 5 mins you either get 1 15 second ad or 2 5 second ads. Thats 15 seconds every 300 which is 5% of the time. Thats for a FREE service. Some videos only have an ad at the start too so you wait 10-15 seconds then you get an uninterupted 1080p/4k video without paying or without even making an account!

Compare to normal TV which is about 6 mins of ads per 24 mins, thats 25% of the time. Thats for a PAID service, like $30/month paid service too.

It honestly seems like a decent deal. Then for ad free it's ¬£12/month which if you watch 30 mins daily then its worth it, it comes with Youtube music streaming too. I do think they should have done a ¬£8/month option without music or anything else, just ad free and downloads. I doubt they make more than ¬£8 in ads from most people."
In the 60s and 70s, shows were cut for like 53 minutes instead of 40. They had to be re-edited for newer ad slots which cut out content. I found this out watching old Perry Mason and Star Trek (TOS) reruns as a kid in the 70s-90s.
I still remember being mad when the ad break started after the first 15 minutes of the Spongebob episode that day!
Which is why I mostly watched BBC back when I watched TV. My wife has various commercial channels on now when she's watching stuff and the constant banality of most of the adverts drives me insane.
Probably because television knows where to put a cliffhanger. Those fuckers at Google will place an ad wherever the fuck they please. Plus, if you have a bad connection, it‚Äôll take forever for that ad to load regardless of how much of the actual video has loaded.
Now, instead of cliffhangers fading to black followed by long commercial breaks, we get a couple of five second commercials smack dab in the middle of a sentence
"I instinctively hit mute on ads I can't skip.

Or walk away from the gas station ads you can't silence with a button press."
I started watching YouTube because I couldn't stand all the advertising on normal tv. With adblock I don't even get ads on youtube. Too bad I can't put adblock on my PS4.
"Television ads were/are significantly worse than YouTube.  I don't like ads either, but I roll my eyes when I see people shrieking about how ""ADS ARE MAKING YOUTUBE UNWATCHABLE!!!""

Annoying, yes. Unwatchable? Um, no."
"I'd rather spend 3 minutes fiddling around how to copy paste the URL into my ad blocking app to watch a 1 minute video in peace than spend 5 seconds watching the most aggravating, patronizing, Cthulhu level mind-fucking jingle of people who look way to fucking happy to be normal YouTube ad. 

and they keep breaking my app too but luckily they update often. fuck you YouTube. 

this is why I pay like 20 bucks more on my already hell inflated cable bill just to have DVR and NEVER watch an ad again. 

my hatred for ads is stronger than the reincarnation of Hitler born into a family of fundamental American Confederates in the deep south who is now a baker and a gay black Jew just walked into his cake shop."
Commercials were when you go to the bathroom, make some food, or chat about the story so far with who you are watching it with. I can't understand why people actually watch them instead of doing something else. The superbowl commercials though... sometimes worth watching for entertainment value.
See, 10 minutes here and there is whatever if it‚Äôs a free service. I‚Äôll just go do something else. By making them random and short, it makes it so walking away or taking a bathroom break no longer happens during commercials.
Pisses me right off how they‚Äôre dropping them right in the middle of videos now to try to force you into signing up for their premium service.
I think it has to do a lot with conditioning. I once went a period of like 4 months where I didn't watch any TV. At all. Not even in passing. The first time I saw a TV commercial it was so jarring. Like wtf is this shit? Why are they so aggressive? Stop shoving this product in my face. These people sound like cons. I had to get up and leave the room, it was just too much.
We totally needed those breaks for snacks and you couldn't take the tv with you to the bathroom either.
YouTube isn't designed to have ad breaks. Television was. A new show generally started *right* after the closing credits; enough to hook you to have you stay through the first break. YouTube has ads *before* the content starts.
"I'm slightly the opposite, I guess. I'll sit for 5-15sec ads. When I was a kid watching TV, though, the *second* it switched to commercial, I was channel surfing for non-commercial entertainment. If nothing came up, ""sorry rest-of-the-episode, I'm hitting Input and playing Playstation""."
Its because you are no longer a sheep. You have woken up to the scam that big advertisement has been running to get more ads in the streets.
Imagine flipping channels and the first thing you see is always a commercial. Surely I‚Äôm not the only one who gets less and less interested to watch videos because of this.
"I‚Äôm from the UK, and as a kid I always thought it was weird that American TV shows were only 20 minutes long (like the Simpsons on the BBC). 

My SO is from the US, and every time I go over there and we happen to watch a bit of TV with her family I‚Äôm just blown away with the amount of ads that come on. I find it really hard to watch."
Though, as a kid we didn‚Äôt know that instant gratification of having something immediately like that though. Like, we had dial up and that ‚Äòprlll ra ding da Ding‚Äô sound actually instilled some excitement ‚Äòoh mahh gawd I‚Äôm going on the INTERNET!‚Äô
yeah, but that you also couldn't pause live tv, so you'd use that time to go take a piss or get a snack or whatever.
Because YouTube wasn't TV back then. YouTube was this cool site where you didn't have to worry about commercials, or corporate accounts, it was just people uploading whatever.
i paid for a hooker, but she just wanted to suck my cock. any way i can convince her to help me with my ad problem?
"The ads get that long that I put the phone down and do something else quickly so it has the reverse effect.
I‚Äôm betting in years to come, they will see if your eyes are looking at the phone and pause it when you look away"
"I'm not so sure if users would give up that easily.

The biggest Youtube equivalents in China, Youku and Bilibili.com among others have had 45 to 120 second unskippable ads for many years now, and unfortunately they just get richer while users put up with it.

It wouldn't surprise me if Youtube received complaints for obnoxious changes, looks at the successful competition that already has them, and just shrugs."
"Holy. Shit. 


But it's asking lots of questions now, that's so much extra work than just staring at my phone zoned out when the ad plays"
Which one is legit? There are a lot of similarly named, similar icon, but different developers on Google Play.
If you have Android, install Vanced. Alternatively, there should be a small info icon (a circled 'i') somewhere (usually bottom left). You can report the ad or something, give no reason and it'll close the ad.
That's what they want you to do... Was thinking about it but ever since they started bombing ads, I was like F this Imma not falling in your trap...
I feel like they're *slightly* more tolerable on Twitch, because you have somewhere else to look at (Twitch chat and who else is currently streaming). On Youtube there's usually nothing else to look at aside from the same 5+ recommended videos that you never click on.

Same, my gag reflex has always been intense. I think it took them like five tries to get an okay mould
My gag reflex normally isn‚Äôt bad but the second they put the tray in I started heaving. Nothing actually came up, thankfully, but the lady did say I produced an exceptional amount of saliva. It was literally dripping off the bottom of the mold. So gross
Urgh I remember gagging on that stuff! My orthodontist was just like ‚ÄòNo, no, don‚Äôt do that‚Äô as if I could just, not gag?
When I got it done they did the top and bottom teeth separately and since I clearly struggled with the top the hygienist thought it would be a good idea to give me a mirror to help me with the bottom. It did not help. Instead of just feeling terrible and wanting to pull it out I saw my visibly distressed state which made it worse because then I was embarrassed about how scared I looked. That image of my face in the mirror haunts me to this day lmao
"I actually swallowed a piece and thought I was gonna die, I tried telling them but they just looked at me while holding it in my mouth, I told them afterwards and they seemed like it was not a big deal. And that mold wasn't even good to use so they made me do it again.

Oh no this gave me flashbacks. Same thing happened to me I got so embarrassed and the lady said to breathe through the nose which helped but I was already in tears
"they always smudge so much in there, that 90% of that gunk is pressing right into your whole mouth.

Disgusting."
i‚Äôve been holding off on SmileDirectClub because the first part of the process is doing the molds for your teeth lmao
It's like what I think waterboarding must be like. No ability to breathe, if you try you might smother on a substance forced in your mouth.
Oh my god same, I remember them having to hold me down to the chair and it was so embarrassing, I‚Äôm so glad other people had the same experience lmao
"Before my doctor did this mold thing when I was 11 or so, he prepared me by asking me to lift my right or left leg once he asks me to. Once the gagging started and I reflexively tried to yank out the mold thing, he made me lift my legs in order, which distracted me / occupied my mind enough to help make it through it
I still occasionally remember that moment when a simple trick was totally effective and made me feel better."
"I will NEVER F'N understand why they have to OVERFILL the things SO MUCH that a pound of that shit is dripping down your throat. There's no fucking way that the trays need to be OVERFILLED that fucking much. I don't even have a gag reflex AT ALL (or at least, I didn't until I was pregnant). But it's infuriating that they HEAP that stuff into the mold about 1"" or more over the top edge of the thing, so that there's physically no way to bite down without 70% of it oozing out of the tray entirely and ending up everywhere."
I can so relate!! I vomited while it was still in my mouth and started frantically pulling it out but I couldn't un-suction it. Then the dental assistant came and angrily pulled it out, then yelled at me. I hate that thing.
This reminds me after the first time I drank I didn't know how much I could handle and started to feel nauseous but I didn't wanna be like everybody else and throw up my first time so I just tried to hold it in and then I let out the BIGGEST burp of my life and that was my cue to go to the bathroom and try to barf.
Ask them to use the kid sized trays. I‚Äôve done that & while the experience is still unpleasant, it helps with the vomit factor.
"I have definitely thrown up at the dentist and the orthodontist. Yay for having a super small mouth. 

I've gotten much better over the years, I found the trick is to keep my breathing steady and focus on that."
"That's nothing, i was sick while the guys hands were still holding the mould in place. My dad simply laughed while most of it stayed the place.


The taste didn't leave me for far too long."
For me it didn‚Äôt go past the back of my teeth so it wasn‚Äôt far back enough for my gag reflex or anything
I got braces in 3rd grade and I threw up all over my shirt. Lucky I get a shirt for getting braces and I have to get them again in a couple of months
Lol. I still remember being 15 and throwing up a full English breakfast all over my poor orthodontist
I remember they put the gigantic plastic thing in my mouth to prevent it from closing. I started gagging like a dog trying to throw up really bad. It was pretty funny but I took it out and said yeah I can‚Äôt do that
Pro tip that my orthodontist told me: when that part comes have them put their finger under your nose and try to smell it. I know it sounds weird but when you concentrate breathing through your nose your gag reflex turns off
"Same, I almost threw up on my ortho.

I was embarrassed until I found out one of my friends or siblings (can‚Äôt remember) ACTUALLY threw up on him."
My gag reflex is terrible and I was so happy when I went to talk about braces and they said I didn't need them.
"Mine was the opposite, I have no gag reflex. My orthodontist was surprised. I just awkwardly said, ""Yeah, haha. Would you look at that.""  Heavily Mormon state, he knew my grandma, they all had their guesses as to why..."
damn this is exactly what happened to me when I was getting my retainer mold. They had a bucket next to me just in case I threw up, but I knew I wouldn't, so I was laughing, crying, and retching all at once... basically having a complete breakdown in the middle of the orthodontists office. Fortunately the bottom mold was almost completely painless.
I relate to this so much. They did it once messed that one up and needed to take the mold again...worst 30 seconds ever.
I had to do this or something similar for a sports mouthpiece and never having braces or a retainer or anything of the sort I was pretty confident the fat ass metal tray was NOT going to fit but dude wedged it in there and said stay still until the timer goes off then I'll be back. He left and after about 30 seconds I was questioning my ability to get enough air through my nose and kind of freaking out. I remember thinking fuck this is how I go huh?
"Haha same! Except I also vomited. When I was like 10 I had to get the mold for braces. Vomited all over myself, the orthodontist, and everyone else helping. I went to that ortho until I had a post-surgery check at age 26. They always remembered that. Always. I had to probably get like 10 molds for braces and retainers over the years, and I never threw up again from it and they always remembered and were super careful. It was always so close but they helped me get through what was the longest 30 seconds ever.

The taste afterwards and all the little putty bits in your mouth was so nasty too."
this thread has reminded me of when i got braces as a child. The lady making the molds did my top and bottom teeth separately, and when i was gagging, struggling with them she replied ‚Äúwow i‚Äôve never seen someone gag while doing the top teeth before‚Äù. Like what lady?? This is awful!!
Oh my God. I have a super active gag reflex and emetophobia...I kept involuntarily shoving the dentist away (like, just zero control over it at all, my brain just going NO GET IT OUT). In the end they used the mold tray thing for bottom teeth, which doesn‚Äôt have the roof of your mouth bit, to do my top teeth as well. My teeth are still not straight and I think that has something to do with it.
The dentist said I had the strongest gag reflex he'd seen. They had to cut cotton balls in half when they cleaned my teeth. Then I learned that gripping your thumbs eliminates your gag reflex mostly.
"my orthodontist (well, the assistant) put so much of that goop in once they got an impression of my tonsils. 

I WAS CHOKING FOR A REASON, NOT JUST MY GAG REFLEX THIS TIME!!

she kept telling me to breathe through my nose, deep breaths. finally takes the damn thing out. ""oh, we got your tonsils!"""
When the orthodontist took a molds of my teeth when I was around 10, I projectile vomited all over her and her assistant. I don‚Äôt even have a sensitive gag reflex.
"That's nothing.  
Back when I had to have braces and they used that stuff, I legitimately threw up. And it wasn't just a little bit of liquid, but actual food chunks and it even made me tear up."
Impressions. My brother is the same way, he literally threw up on the floor when he had an impression, and kept saying that it was the worst thing, but when I had my first impression I didn‚Äôt know it was an impression, and I wonder how it‚Äôs that bad for him. I guess some people are different.
"I threw up just getting the mold thingy done. Then I cried when the shitty nurse was like 'you'll be wearing this [retainer] the rest of your life' like why the fuck would you say that to a scared 12 year old

teeth are still fucked up lol"
"Same. All over myself over an hour from home. I was so humiliated. Thankfully my mom went and got me something cheap and clean to change into. But one of the uppity girls I went to school with was there and I was terrified she would tell everyone at school. I grew up in a very small town and was bullied anyway. But once I was clean she came over to me and said ""don't worry about it I did the same thing the first time"". It helped with the fear but I was still mortified."
Same. Had to sit there with puke all over myself while they waited for the mold to set. The assistants were facing away from me trying not to throw up as well. Worst, most embarrassing thing ever for a 13 year old. There has to be a better way.
I also have a terrible gag reflex, but I didn‚Äôt throw up during my first molding. I threw up when I got home because the lady doing the mold sprayed all the numbing stuff on the back of my throat rather than my tongue, so I swallowed a lot of it. The smell of Arby‚Äôs and numbing spray never leaves you.
When I had braces I once saw a kid at the ortho who they had like covered in plastic before they took the moulds of his mouth and I asked why and I guess he was allergic to the stuff and would violently vomit every time. Braces are traumatizing.
Oh my god I was sobbing cause the assistant shoved it into my gums and cut me. The whole time she‚Äôs saying ‚Äòoh it‚Äôs not that bad, I‚Äôve had it done before‚Äô, then she pulls it out and blood just pours from my mouth. The orthodontist kinda chewed her out haha
I was lucky. I got plastic but I have a terrible gag reflex and needed to redo them a couple times. I‚Äôve also had braces on twice so I‚Äôve had it happen a bunch, especially when I lost it broke my retainers (lost one and broke another)
Metal tray? Pretty sure they can also use a hard plastic tray for the mold material, if there using metal if would just be more uncomfortable.
It really does. And sorry I‚Äôm going to change tracks fast, but WEAR YOUR RETAINER. PLEASE. Seriously, especially right after you get it, if I missed wearing my retainer for 2 days, the next I put it in it would HURT. Like, hurt as bad as the first time I got braces hurt.
Find an orthodontist who uses a mouth scanning tool. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called but the ortho uses a wand to scan my teeth and the image appears on a screen and they make my Invisalign trays from that.
I did it last week and they did it 3 times because the dentist messed up on the top row and had to repeat.
Totally agreed. It's such an immensely satisfying feeling, I'm surprised everyone here hates it so much.
Lol I remember that, I had to convince my brain I'm not going to choke while hyperventilating through my nose and tearing up
Nope, personally it was my FAVORITE part, I loved it! I was always disappointed when there was no impressions that day :(
"Recently I had to get my retainer replaced and I was amazed that dentistry has done away with a bit of that torture. 

I just hope everything gets easier and easier so when I'm old it will be a breeze"
I remember it was like I forgot how to breathe through my nose and going into sheer panic because I couldn't breathe and everyone was shouting 'through your NOSE' at me and I couldn't figure out how for what felt like an eternity (but was probably maybe ten seconds in reality).
I think that in some cases a 3D xray of your teeth can replace the need to do the mold. But it's a fairly newer technology.
"something about waking up the next morning, having prepared yourself for never doing that again the previous night, really sticks with you in a way that‚Äôs hard to describe

feeling as thought you‚Äôre not *supposed* to exist"
This is really true. Imagine if someone tried to kill you. Or even if you knew with 100% certainty that someone was standing right next to you struggling with the idea of whether to kill you or not. When you're that close to killing yourself, even if you don't try you have to go on knowing that you were that close forever.
"One of the cruelest things I've ever experienced was the sunrise after the longest and worst night of my life.


I've been through many, many, challenging times since then, but I've never felt anything like the complete and utter desolation of the last vestige of hope that things could ever get better that I felt that morning. 

I sat and watched the sky start getting brighter and brighter until the sun was over the horizon, shining on everything with absolute apathetic indifference.

No paths out of the depths presented themselves, the magnitude of the crises I was trying to navigate failed to lessened in severity. I experienced no stunning revelations, and nothing seemed better in the light of day.

I had been awake for several days at that point. It had been several days since I had eaten.
No place to lay down, no food to eat, sitting in silence, watching the city come alive around me, I saw how alone I truly was. I had nothing in front of me, and no one behind me.

I have never felt so tired, so bone achingly weary, and it was accompanied by the inescapable sensation of dejected defeat and loss.

&nbsp;

Fortunately I made it out of what was the unquestionably worst and hardest time of my life. Things are much better now, I've got a loving family and a house, all that good stuff. But I'll always remember what it's like to truly *feel* how no matter what happens to you, the sun will rise all the same the next day. Knowing that you as a idea and person are a small mote in the world at large is one thing, but to experience what it feels like to be that insignificant mote is eye opening.

I can't recommend it."
I almost did it one night, even if I made it out I've never felt the same ever since. A part of me died that night for sure, for a couple of days I felt so disassociated. I wasn't even looking at what was in front of me, all I did was keep my eyes open, afraid to close them and fall back again
I've experienced this a few times myself, but my most memorable thought that stuck with me afterwards was thinking about how there could possibly be a parallel universe where I did actually follow through with it, and I no longer exist in that universe now.
I‚Äôm not religious but stories like this just scream divine intervention, whether that‚Äôs fate or the concept of friendship/soul mates/bonds whatever. It‚Äôs just so serendipitous
Thank you, fellow redditor, for making me cry, and for answering that phone call. I hope you are in a better place now.
"Bruh, plz don't let yourself get to that point! Much harder to come back from it. Get help, get right out of your situation (go on holiday) for a couple of days, go stay with a friend. Do whatever it takes!
I have faith in ya, shooting ya many virtual hugs!"
I get so overwhelmed with text conversations. Sometimes I just don't want to respond, or I feel like what I might say in that instance isn't what I want to have said. So I just push it aside. And the stigma against leaving on read has shamed me into not even reading texts in the first place.
Got ghosted by somebody who I was trying to get a commission from for a month. He kept reading my messages and never replied. Wasted so much of my time before I decided to hire somebody else ...
I sent one once in the middle of a convo, and was immediately left on read for several hours. It was awful, although everything turned out fine..;; >.<
Whats worse is watching the typing animation start and stop. Go find something to do come back and they are still typing and then you get nothing.
"I really hate this gen z mentality. I grew up in 90's and when I got a cell phone and got a text, I was able to read it and respond when I wanted to. 

Now, I dated a girl 5 years younger than me and boy or boy it was ridiculous. We ended up breaking up. Funny enough, I'm dating a girl 6 years younger than me now and she actually doesn't care as much if I leave her on read cause she knows I'll eventually respond to her. But screw people who care about being ""left on read"". I got shit to do. You're not the number 1 most important thing on my list."
Funny story. I'm a dumbass and didn't even realize that was a thing. My future wife finally asked if I knew it was on after we'd dated for like 6 months. She said my response time and lack of games was one of the reasons she liked me. Sometimes it pays to be if stupid (but authentic)
I'm a dumbass and didn't even realize that was a thing years back. My future wife finally asked if I knew it was on after we'd dated for like 6 months. She said my response time and lack of games was one of the reasons she liked me. Sometimes it pays to be stupid (but authentic)
I was left on unread for months from my ex-best friend. I sent a few messages (5 or 6?) over a month starting new years, even congratulating her on her marriage. I had feelings for her previously and needed closure so removed her as my friend a few months after we stopped talking. I looked her up some weeks later to find out I'd been blocked. In messenger, I saw that she had hearted a photo I sent; the message still showed as undelivered.
"Got left on ""read"" one time. Turns out they were actually lost for words for like 5 minutes, after what I had told them"
I really need to get out of the habit of checking my texts when I wake up because of this. In my head it's a good idea in case something important happens. But I am way to tired to respond to the texts and I often forget until the next time I look at my phone, which could be hours.
Isn't being left on read kinda the end of it? I've never personally had that happen, but if it did, I probably wouldn't bother messaging that person again.
"You can always ask for clarification - like, ‚Äúdo want to continue to chat or are you saying goodbye without having to say it?‚Äù  

Just be a man about it and be clear."
It's worse on snapchat. Just seeing the backspace bitmoji is enough to make you want to rip your hair out.
Brains are weird. Liking someone is one thing, but confessing to it makes it real, and real things can be taken away. It's your mind protecting itself in an odd, irrational way.
It sounds like she actually just needed time to process how she felt about you but didn't want to tell you that
Reminds me of when I was a teenager and told my crush I liked her and asked her out. Her reply was, hold on I need to ask my friends. I quickly lost any feelings I had, but hey at least she was honest up front!
It used to be a common piece of dating advice, never respond within 2 or 3 days because it makes you look desperate and undesirable.  Things have changed since then but it used to be common.  Pre cell phone obviously.  1970-80s.
"Maybe she thought waiting was the cool thing to do. Like how guys used to be told about the 3 day rule*

*wait 3 days to call her back"
"I assume you took a lot longer than 3 days to figure out your feelings and tell her how you felt, and you didn't have the pressure of knowing she had feelings for you.

It would have been nice of her to at least give you a placeholder response while she sorted through her feelings, but I don't think 3 days is that unreasonable."
Not really that weird, some girls think that if they play too easy to get the guy will lose interest.
I had the same except 2 months later, found out later her phone broke right as she went to click the msg
The subject is 30 seconds, not 3 days, you expected her to respond quickly like she had nothing better to do with her life, and she's the weird one?
"Sometimes I put my phone in airplane mode so that way I know I'm not getting a response no matter what.

But then 20 minutes later it's driving me crazy so I turn the signal back on to check."
See My mind goes someplace else...  Like, it's so risky the NSA might swing by later for a surprise party.  Need to clean this place up.  Wouldn't want then to have no place to sit...
It‚Äôs a combination of wanting a distraction from waiting for a response and trying to internally convince yourself that you actually don‚Äôt care that much about the response and you‚Äôll just go on with your normal day until they happen to respond (even though in the back of your mind you know that your phone buzzing and their name popping up is the only thing you can think about)
I don't know if it still does this, but when it first became a thing on the iPhone, it did it for as long as the keyboard was open, with the cursor in the reply box--whether you were typing or not. Get distracted by the TV while messaging? Someone thinks you're typing. Then not.
I 100% understand the sentiment. I've been on both sides and both are their unique kind of anxiety-inducing.
"Is there not? Android just got ""advanced"" text messaging features this year that are really just read receipts and typing indicators and you can turn one or both off"
I'm really sorry to hear you've had such awful experiences with men. Don't give up. The good ones are worth wading through the crap for. And also stay away from Bears. They get bitey.
"My best friend would text things like, ""Can we get dinner tonight? There's something I've wanted to talk to you about. I won't tell you what it is because I don't want you to be anxious but it has to do with you. It might be bad... it depends how you take it. But don't worry about it, we'll talk about it tonight."" And then she'd only respond with, ""I'll tell you later"" to any questions, and then completely ignore me until we met up.

&#x200B;

She did this at least once a year and I started getting anxiety attacks every time she'd message me politely because I knew it was going to be something she was holding a grudge about for months. She'd act like she's being charitable for at least telling me and not ghosting me. It took me an embarrassingly long time for me to realize that what she was doing was shitty."
"I got a text that said ""Don't call, it's late, but go out and look at the moon"" after a heated argument. :) That was lovely. *No talk im angy but go look at da moo*."
"I have been the boyfriend in this scenario. Not this particular human's boyfriend, of course, but I have 100% gotten the ""can you call"" and freaked the hell out thinking either I did something wrong, someone was hurt, or something was about to go down.

Not trying to say that you did anything wrong, by the way, it happens. But I 100% understand where he was coming from in the moment."
"Not the same but you just made me consider ...The one time I called my friend was to tell her that someone I loved very much just died.

She must have been wondering why I was calling because we never call each other, only text. 
I'm sure if I do call her again she'll be wondering who died. Yikes, never thought of that."
i do this with my friends because i really like hearing their voices, i'm a very auditory person and it just makes communication a lot easier - is there a better way to put this than just asking them if they can call?
"I get voice mails from my dad that say ""hey, it's dad. please call me""

After vomiting I eventually call and he needs help with his Kindle or something else minor."
"Damn, that's what my mom does with her grandkids. You know you done fucked up when Grandma asks if you want to go for a walk.

Raising her voice: Eh. Giving a ""knock it off"" look: Whatever. ""Let's go for a walk."": Oh shit oh no I've really done it now!

I'm sorry."
"*""You wanna go for a walk?""*

*""Yeah babe, that sounds nice""*

*""Good, don't bother coming back afterwards""*"
"My first ex did the same! The second gave me the ""we need to talk"", but he said it 24 hours before we would actually be able to talk so I was in anxiety hell the whole time"
"""We need to talk.""  


""Sounds good, I had something I'd been meaning to talk to you about too, while we're at it."""
I've pulled this line entirely unintentionally. We both wanted to call things off so it all worked out! And we're still mates to this day so that's dope
"My boss will just stop and say ""oh? And what do we need to talk about?"" And then I'll just be sitting there awkwardly being all ""I didn't expect to get this far"""
"I'm stealing that.

If you're ok with that.

I mean, you can't do anything about it, but I don't want to seem rude.

Screw it, I'll just steal it."
You ever get the text that says ‚Äúwe need to talk, call me.‚Äù So you call them and the mother fucker doesn‚Äôt even answer! I should‚Äôve just lived with the wolves.
To be fair, this habit alone isn't a sign of emotional abuse. I've had numerous SOs with no anxiety disorders who just don't understand how cryptic messages fuck with anxious people. Every time, I've had to explain it to them, and most of them would stop. It's the one who actively didn't stop whom I realized was inconsiderate.
"TIL my parents and my grandmother are emotionally abusive shits.

(Seriously though i've told my entire family that i want to be told ""[Person] has *died""* and never ""Come home quick we need to talk""."
Mine did too. And it was always stupid stuff. ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù *4 hours later* ‚ÄúMy grandma wants us to come over for brunch on Sunday.‚Äù
"My ex did this to me while we were dating. Sent me a text at like 10 at night saying we needed to have a talk. ""What kind of talk? Good talk? Bad talk?"" Got back ""just a talk.""

Couldn't see her for three days after that message, but I was 100% convinced it wasn't the breakup talk because ""it's my birthday on Tuesday, she wouldn't do that to me.""

Guess who did that to me."
"My boyfriend does this too over innocuous things. Once I got out of the shower and he call all serious and pulled me in, saying we needed to talk. Was all somber with the whole ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been meaning to talk to you about, I‚Äôm sorry but..‚Äù

And then just laughs. He had something entirely irrelevant to ask and laughed at the look of concern/fear on my face. 

Later apologized saying he realized it was shitty and that he just says things to see how people react. Now I‚Äôm realizing that‚Äôs just shitty all around and not normal."
I didn't realize that my ex was leaving until 3 days after she left because I had become so accustom to being gaslit into changing my behavior to suit her. It was craziness. It took me a good 3-4 months to figure out I was with someone who was INCREDIBLY emotionally abusive.
Im sorry for that u didnt deserve it, nobody does. I cant speak out of experience considering the furthest i have come lovelife wise is...well litteraly 0 but i can imagine how awful it must have been
"I actually asked my boss the last time she did something like that to just give an idea of what she wants to talk about.

Instead of ""call me"", it's ""call me about XYZ project"", that way I know it's a question she has or whatever, instead of me thinking I'm going to get fired or yelled at.

She has followed that suggestion a lot to date, so it's made me less anxious, I'm grateful for that!"
My dad will text me when I‚Äôm in my room ‚Äúcome downstairs‚Äù and I go downstairs anxious and he‚Äôll be sitting at the kitchen table on his laptop and turns it around to some YouTube video and says ‚Äúyou have to see this!‚Äù
My girlfriend does this all the time. I just straight up tell her you need to stop this shit. If you have time to type ‚ÄúWe need to talk‚Äù then you have time to type ‚ÄúWe need to talk about blah blah blah‚Äù. I just need to know what the topic of discussion would be. We have a very stable and healthy relationship so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm worried about anything in particular but there is just something about those words that make my mind race.
Its almost worse when they say it without having something bad to say, then u are frightened for no reason
"Turn off the brush, spit, turn it back on

Edit: not to be a stereotype but this blew up, thx guys and girls and all"
Maybe you are using too much toothpaste? They always show a toothbrush loaded up in commercials, but you really only need a pea sized dollop.
"I don't spit until I'm done. That's what she said. On rare ocassions that I do have to spit I just let it run down my chin. That's what she said. 

My girlfriend turns it off takes it out spits and continues. It pauses the time and resumes when she turns it back on. But you can't pause it for more than a 10 seconds, it'll reset. 

We have the most basic Sonicare so Im sure it's a feature on most"
"I usually don't spit until the end (I use a small pea-sized amount and my dentist raves over my teeth), but I occasionally just bend my head over the sink so it's parallel with it, open my mouth, and the spit just drops out of my mouth? It doesn't dribble down over anything. 

Also, trick, don't rinse your mouth after literally brushing a protective layer on your enamel. You're just washing all the good away. Easier for me because I apparently produce excess saliva."
I just press the power button to stop the toothbrush for the few seconds I need it out so I can spit in the sink. It fucks the timed intervals up, but I don‚Äôt care about that much.
Get toothpaste without sodium laurel sulfate. That foam doesn‚Äôt help clean anything and is why orange juice tastes like cleaning solvent after brushing.
"First, I don't think I've ever spit before being finished, do people do that? 

Second, I had a similar problem when I first got an electric toothbrush.  You get used to it.  At first, it was constantly running out of my mouth.  Now though it doesn't happen."
I angle my head back a little bit to help and also close my lips around the brush right when I‚Äôm pulling it out of my mouth to switch sides. the comment from u/X0AN is also correct, you shouldn‚Äôt have to spit before you‚Äôre completely finished, if you do, try less toothpaste. They aren‚Äôt kidding when they say pea sized, it doesn‚Äôt take a lot. I think a lot of people use way more than necessary when they brush. hope this helps :)
I  move it to one side of my mouth and spit around the side it if that makes sense... the more you do it the better you get at it.
I look up when and kinda.. suck the foam deeper into my mouth.. buys me just enough time to take it out.. then I can close my mouth
I tilt my head slightly back so the toothpaste can‚Äôt come dribbling out and hold my toothbrush slightly up  as well. Then when the timer is up, take the toothbrush out and spit!
Use a very small amount of toothpaste, you don't need much. Also, don't use any water to wet the toothbrush prior. This helps a ton since the vibrations can make a crazy amount of foam if its too wet etc.
Same issue. So glad I‚Äôm not alone. Been meaning to ask my husband if he has the issue but so hard to describe it.  Thank you!
The toothbrush I have saves the time I'm at for a few seconds so I can turn it off, spit, then turn it back on again.
"Use a dime sized amount of paste that isnt much higher than the surface of the brush.

You only need enough toothpaste to coat you teeth, not fill your mouth with foam.

The toothpaste commercials with a giant log of paste are lying to you.

Also you can't turn your brush off and back on? I guess it might mess with the timer but idk."
If you have one like the Braun/oral b or Sonicare, turning it off for a second to spit won't reset the timer from what I've noticed. Or, you can wait for the vibration, turn it off and spit, and then turn it back on and just finish up. Those toothbrushes don't automatically turn off after 2 minutes either. If you have a cheapo electric TB, invest in one that I initially mentioned üòÅ
Turn it off before you take it out of your mouth but keep brushing like normal then spit as though it was a normal brush
Tilt your head forward slightly and you can spit/drool straight down into the sink without getting drool all down your face.
I turn mine off tomsoit and when I turn it back on it continues the same cycle for 2 minutes total. So it's real handy. I know once I get the constant vibration my 2 minutes is up.
Keep a slight negative pressure inside your mouth (e.g. suck in on the toothbrush just enough to keep the drool in).
Honestly I had that at first when I got one last year, I dunno what adjusted for me but it doesn‚Äôt happen anymore
I‚Äôm not sure if yours is like mine, but there‚Äôs a short grace period after turning it off on some of them where it still keeps count. So if I accidentally used too much toothpaste and have to spit I just turn it off, spit, and turn it back on again.
Using too much toothpaste. What you see in the commercials is just way too much. All you need is a little pea sized blob.
"I figured that out before. If you just keep your chin higher the 90 degrees and keep the toothbrush held with the base pointing up rather than down, it'll never dribble. 

The dribble from the toothbrush will go into your mouth cos the base is pointing upwards, and the dribble won't come out of your mouth because your head is above 90 degrees. 

Works a charm."
"If you stop it just long enough to spit and restart it, it remembers your ""time."" At least *my* SonicCare does."
If you turn off the tooth brush and turn it back on within 10 seconds or so it continues the cycle you are in the middle of.
Purse your lips like you‚Äôre whistling and spit a solid stream instead of the typical shotgun blast we all do
Am I the only one confused by this? Take the brush out of your mouth. Do you all leave the brushes in when you spit? I mean, not that there's anything wrong with it, but none of the responses say anything about just taking the brush out of your mouth. That's a bit odd to me.
Wha.. I never need to spit in between. Maybe it's the type or amount of paste you use that makes your mouth full of foam. Idk
Don‚Äôt wet the brush before brushing. Put a small pea sized amount of toothpaste onto the dry brush & use. Source: friend who told me to do this is a dentist.
"You people spit before you're done brushing?

Ooooh I'm just realizing you probably use the foaming toothpaste? Don't recommend that unless you want greater chance of mouth sores

Sodium laryl sulfate is nasty shit"
Does he give the thumbs down when things are bad. That would be horrifying to see. Or maybe a Gladiator hand in the middle and a slow thumbs up to thumbs down üëé
Dude gives the thumbs up and he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, she didn‚Äôt make it but you saved money on your car insurance!‚Äù
THIS ALL DAY.  My wife had major surgery just reading the description of the doctor walking across the waiting room gave me flashbacks.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to tell you this..  but your hair is a mess. You should comb it before you go see your mother. She‚Äôs alive btw. ‚Äú
So true and put like that, I am happy too for the surgeon that he could deliver that little thumbs up- what an emotional burden
I am so terribly sorry to hear this and that you didn't get to say goodbye. I cannot imagine that. My mom has had many surgeries and I know that feeling you're talking about with the gut expectation of worst case scenario.
"oh goodness that sounds horrifying to get a ""everything is great!"" call at 1 AM. So glad your fiance is ok!"
Thank you! I've called my mom a bunch of times today to relive that moment and also just tell her she's such a bad ass! She was so happy too! Full circle of happiness here!
8 years later and she's kicking ass! She had colon cancer in 1988 and as a result had about 15 major abdominal surgeries like an ileoanal pull-through for example. As a result she has a ton of scar tissue which often cause adhesions and blockages in her small bowel. Essentially a portion of her small bowel was tied in a knot and the tissue started to die and she was declining so they did what I think is a called a resection to get that unhealthy part out. Every time I respond to someone I keep being reminded of what a bad ass my mom is, I've called her like 10 times today to tell her how proud I am of her. Thanks for your curiosity :)
Wow what a lovely doctor- because inevitably the surgeries always take way longer than expected! So glad your dad is OK!
"My dad is the luckiest green light getter on the planet. 
He always tells me the fastest way to get somewhere and I have to remember he always hits greens.
He is red green colorblind but I've never seen him run a red so in pretty sure that's not it."
My dad takes about 10 seconds to notice, and then floors it. Gotta anticipate when he's gonna go so I can brace myself and not have my organs ripped out of my body by the g forces
The longer this takes, the farther behind you should follow that car. It says something about their reaction time, and you don't want them slamming on the brakes at the last second
"""It was the damnedest thing. We were just singing happy birthday when he reached for a fork and tried to stab out his own eye!"""
Part of me feels like singing happy birthday to someone in front of their cake started out as hazing. It‚Äôs never fun for the person being sung to, it‚Äôs fun to some of the people singing, and the rest of them are just there
"> What do I do with my face?

Smile like a benevolent lord or lady receiving the adulation they are due.

> What do I do with my hands?

You are the conductor for this ensemble performance.

> WHAT DO I DO WITH MY EYES?

A withering glance at any participants singing a little sharp or flat should help tighten up the chorus and get everyone in harmony."
You pick out someone from the group of singers, look them dead in the eye, and whisper the song back to them on a 1 second delay
I always really lean into it: ‚Äúthat‚Äôs right this is all about me‚Äù, ‚Äúhow about a little more enthusiasm‚Äù, ‚Äúget it right this time or you‚Äôre doing it again‚Äù. You know just be a dick about it but in a funny way.
You make eye contact with one person and keep it. Preferably try not to blink at all. Try to channel Willem Dafoe in the Lighthouse.
"Sing along with them, say someone else's name at the name part, then look around and go ""oh. me? honestly i forgot lol"""
Look at the people singing at you. Smile, about the silliness of the ritual, and be glad that at least some of those people like you well enough to do the silly ritual for and with you, maybe even a lot better. Conduct with your hands. Grin widely at and with them, about the silliness of it all and you taking part in it and taking it to eleven.
"Pick up a fork and start conducting your choir while laughing maniacally and shouting ""Good, yes, louder!"" between every line."
The go to is to act like you're conducting everyone. Make it seem like you're into it, have a good sense of humor about it, and don't have to be awkward
I worry that now when people sing happy birthday to me, I'm going to feel compelled to wash my hands.
"I always pick someone like my brother or a cousin, stare into their eyes and hopefully their soul.

That or sing along/ conduct them."
"I remember there was an askreddit on ‚Äúwhat to do when they sing happy birthday‚Äù and it was pretty inspiring.

Wave your hand like you‚Äôre conducting an orchestra was my favourite."
"You look around, grit and bare the awkwardness and just look at everyone and smile. If they are family, they are their because they love you and you should look and them all and take a moment to appreciate it, and be thankful, even if you don't enjoy the act, because they love you.

If they aren't family, and just co-workers or something to that affect, do the exact same thing, and appreciate that even if you don't like all of these people, even if you despise some of them. That they are still there, singing happy birthday to you, because when we were all young we had someone singing to us on our birthdays, and it was sweet, and wonderful. The fact that we still do this as adults, it's wonderful, and take a moment to appreciate it, and be thankful, even if you don't enjoy the act, because sometimes the world is mean, and in this moment, everyone gets to remind those around them that they matter."
"> What do I do ~~my face? What do I do with my hands? WHAT DO I DO WITH MY EYES?~~

strip

the second people start singing happy birthday to you, you start stripping and gyrating"
Thats easy just aggressively stare down one person. With your hands in your lap. Then once they are done throw your hands up and just start rapidly clapping
"Start conducting them like an orchestra.

Look sternly at Aunt Sally in the back, raising your other hand to signal that she's not pulling her weight."
I'm not sure if everyone does it like this but at least my family starts singing it when the candles are lit and the cake is being brought out. That way the person being sung to can just watch the cake make its way over to them.
Just start break dancing at this point, maybe it‚Äôll make all of THEM uncomfortable and they stop sooner :)
You just join in, sing happy birthday to yourself so energetically the entire ensemble is embarrassed.
You obviously pull out your phone and start recording everyone singing to you then share in on Instagram regardless of how cringe it looks from both sides... dont Forget to put it on the selfie camera and record yourself blowing the candles
"In my language our happy birthday song includes the singers bowing, curtseying, and doing a little dance.
It's ten times worse. I wish they would just sing but no no they're supposed to dance, that's how the song goes."
Whatever you do when you express gratitude for a bunch of people taking time out of their day, and money out of their pockets to come together and celebrate the very fact that you exist in this world.
Stare down the party ring leader. The person who planned it all. Just stare them down with direct eye contact and don't blink. Don't look away. Just stare into their soul so that they may feel the same discomfort that they have caused you.
My dad just had a birthday and we‚Äôre all in masks and socially distancing, the cake comes out with one candle... and there‚Äôs this moment of pause and someone goes ‚ÄúWell do you want us to sing? And before anyone else can do anything my brother in law starts in a rousing full volume ‚ÄúFELIZ NAVIDAD!‚Äù
"Close them. Seriously. Make a standard ""angry/enraged"" face, with your eyes closed. Breathe HEAVILY through your nose.

Everyone will be JUST as awkward and confused as you!"
Find a person in group and lock on them. Also start singing with them while staring on said person. Now you are not alone feeling awkward.
"Face: smile genuinely. If you need something to make you smile, think about how you are just a few minutes away from eating cake. Cake is great.

Hands: if you are sitting at the table, just leave them in your lap. Really, you can leave your hands wherever they were. I am usually a pocket or crossed arms person. Just look at anyone else and copy them. Hold a drink in one hand or whatever.

Eyes: this is the easiest one, look at the cake. The cake will not look back unless it is an incredibly creepy cake and even if that's the case, you are about to eat the cake so you can be confident in your superiority. People will worry less about their bad singing if you don't look at them, so it's a win for everyone. 

Brain: if you need something to consider while waiting for the song to end, think about what you are going to wish for and how you are going to blow out the candles. It does not matter if you believe in birthday wishes or all that jazz, it should be enough to distract you long enough for the song to end and then you have prepared for the candle part so you're ready"
I make eye contact with each person and try to commit their faces to memory. I don‚Äôt know why but is nice to have something to remember friends by when they aren‚Äôt around.
I've taken to staring into the loudest and most obnoxious singer in the eyes the whole time, or at least until they stop singing so loud.
As a former server... Fuck your friend.  I hated doing that because usually I was super busy or it was a pain in the ass to get other servers to sing for my birthday people.
My friends and I used to do a slight variation on this prank. We‚Äôd bring a cake and candles to house parties and once things were in full swing light up the candles and carry the cake in singing happy birthday. The trick was to set down the cake and get back out of the room before you got to the part where you sing the person‚Äôs name. People would always sing along, being a bit drunk, and everyone realizes the joke at the same time. Then there‚Äôs cake! Nice wholesome prank.
Ha! Once my friends organised this for me (on my actual birthday) but the staff got the wrong target so I got to join in whilst my friend looked doubly self-conscious, and it honestly couldn't have been more perfect!
Had this happen to me with a group of teenagers we were chaperoning- I totally went along with it because cake...
"Had that happen to me. My friends knew I absolutely HATED that shit. It was at some Mexican restaurant. They come over slap a huge sombrero on me, start singing. I yell stop a few times, the confused servers look at me as I slap my driver's license on the table announcing it's not my birthday, my friends are assholes as I got up and left. 

It's the one thing I have this irrational hatred for. Everyone I have ever dated I made sure they knew that if they did that I would get up and walk out on them right there.  Had one girl think I was joking, after six months if dating she got up to use the restroom. Came back and two minutes later, singing. I took out my wallet, paid for dinner with cash and walked out. She was laughing the whole time thinking it was an act. That was our last date"
I had a similar, but great experience like that. My dad and I got up early to travel around Christmas last year, and the waitress we had at the restaurant insisted it was my birthday and we had a laugh about it. Then, she asked me if I wanted chocolate or caramel on my birthday sundae! It was a great start to the morning.
Ironically I would find this amusing and feel more comfortable opposed to it actually being my birthday and this happening
My friends in college would go to this one restaurant in Boston every Saturday night called Joe‚Äôs. My friend Allura would always tell the waiter (different everytime) that it was my friend Giselle‚Äôs birthday. We‚Äôd get free cake everytime and poor introverted anxiety ridden Giselle would go beet red as the waiters surrounded her singing. It‚Äôs a wonder she kept coming back with us.
I'm usually a pretty good singer but for some reason I'm always off pitch and in an awkward octave for the birthday song.
"That's fortunate.

When I was in high school and it was my birthday, people would start to sing it, and I'd go ""NO. don't.""

But then they know it annoys me, so throughout the day, they'd constantly go ""‚ô´Haaa-"" and I'm like ""NO!"""
How lucky of you, I told everyone this and all my friends and family are assholes. So they doubled down, got my entire party of like 40 people to sing at once while another friend held me in place. I ran away into the woods never to be seen again...
"i find it weird that people don‚Äôt enjoy it. 

i mean, in adulthood, how often do people stop and recognize your humanity.

i love being sung to. i‚Äôm essentially royalty for that 30 seconds."
"Mine too. My family's second verse is just ""May the good Lord bless you"" four times. Jesus is that awkward.  And sometimes they also throw in a ""How old are you now"". But I have to say, it's much better on the phone or as a voicemail. My grandparents call and sing a duet to every child, grandchild, and even all the spouses. That's the one time I like it."
"I went to a Christian camp, and all of the counselors urged us to stay hydrated. That I did. Which led to me having to pee during the chapel services. The first night it hurt to walk, hurt to pee, somehow it made it so much more difficult to pee but still hurt the same, all cause I committed to staying in the service. Next night I didn't try that again and I had to leave early.

That was the clearest my pee has been for my entire life."
"Worse is when you ask to go to toilet during exam and after 20 min your bladder is full again.

So you ask again.

But after 20 min your bladder is full..... again.

I left an hour early because of that. Never drink a bottle during winters."
"Literally doing this right now, waiting on my guy to get home because I forgot my keys, and I've been waiting soooo long needing to pee. Had to pee half way here. 

Those bushes over there do not look like a bad option."
"
>(I had to pee so bad because I drank around 2 liters of water in one shot before the bus left.)

Proper prior planning prevents piss poor performance"
I was walking to grand Central in NY and about 5 minutes away I had a #2 urgency. By the time I got to the bathroom, which is on the lower level and has about 4 stalls for 100,000 people I was crowning. Not a good feeling.
"I always tell myself I‚Äôve got longer than I do. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to get to the bathroom and someone is going to be in it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre close to home, but there‚Äôs going to be traffic that‚Äôll hold you up, better get ready for another 10-15 minutes.‚Äù

I feel like when I trick myself into believing that there will be a delay, my body kicks in and stops that peepee feelin‚Äô"
But just think about how good it will feel to finally relieve yourself! I never seek it out, but I *always* enjoy being able to pee after holding it in. There are few things that are as enjoyable, and none of them SFW.
"I recently learned about a phenomenon called ""latchkey incontinence,"" which basically describes the feeling of increased urgency to relieve oneself the closer one is to being able to do so. The times I've almost pissed myself while standing over the toilet struggling with my zipper..."
I once had this whilst also having flu- made it just in time until I had a massive coughing fit right as I was pulling my trousers down and just pissed all over myself anyway. Not my finest hour.
"Happened to me on a tour bus in Ireland. We stopped at a tourist spot. I ate a sandwich. Bacon was a little undercooked but eh I‚Äôll be fine. 45 mins into the 3 hour bus ride back to the house, the unmistakable rumbling of a back door explosion. 

I tried to power through on this bus WITH NO TOILET mind you. Couldn‚Äôt do it. I had to have the bus driver pull over on some desolate road in the Dublin area. Not only did I have to get off the bus to expel this brown goblin, I had to find an area far enough away from the bus so no one could see me AND make sure there were no farmers looking at either. 

I found some fenced in field and leaned my back up against the stonewall and DESTROYED this formerly pristine area of the Emerald Isle. After wiping my backside with my socks, I looked up to see at least a dozen sheep just staring at me, with utter shame and disgust. I duck walked back to the bus, feeling better digestion wise, but pride, well.....it was a long way to Tipperary."
imo it's much easier to hold in a poo than a wee. The poo urge tends to recede, the wee urge just intensifies.
You are not alone!  I was wearing leggings.  There was a containment failure...less than ten feet from an open toilet.
I did a cave tour in Kentucky once.  I‚Äôm a bit claustrophobic, so being underground, confined, with roughly 50 people blocking the exit in a line, caused my intestines to spasm.   Gingerly tiptoeing the rest of the tour, using every muscle in my repertoire to hold back my sphincter was the longest day of my life.  I feel your pain lol
Probably because it‚Äôs a fixed amount, it only releases a certain amount of gas. Since it‚Äôs a pump, it‚Äôll take longer to siphon the gasoline from below when you‚Äôre reaching that last tenth of the gallon or so.
"Probably so it can stop on the exact penny. If it was going full speed it would dispense more fluid when it turned off due to inertia.
My guess anyway."

Agreed. Once I finish the exam it's in the past and there's nothing I can do about it, so time to move on. Before the exam is far worse. Also those first thirty seconds when you read each question quickly and realize you don't know how to start *any* of them, before your brain turns on and you remember how to approach them.
"Being in the crowd for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMkcsw3gVbA) was one of the most profound experiences of my life. I've never heard a crowd roar louder, even at professional sporting events. 

For context for the people who wouldn't know, the roar of the crowd when second place was announced wasn't because they'd gotten second, it was because they didn't get first. The celebration for who won started as soon as second place was announced."
"I spent 6 summers in drum corps.  Of the hundreds of shows we did during those 6 years I remember exactly *one* score, and it wasn't even ours.

""With a score of 87, 8-7 point zero... THE CROSSMEN!!""

Not only my first finals, but also the first time since DCI's inception that the corps had played on Saturday night, when we jumped ahead of the Crossmen with our last performance.

Thank you very much for making me remember that moment!"

What the actual kind of tree-eating gumhumper of a person says something like that to their friend? Literally the only reason for her to say that - is if she's insecure of her own looks too, and doesn't want to be alone about the feeling. Dont let that get you down, king. Or Queen. You're making up for any low score in appearance through character, don't worry about that.
"Once a girl at my school gave me a panic attack, I walked away from the situation but I couldn‚Äôt leave the building because it was freezing outside. I went back to get my jacket and she continued to harass me. I then broke down and people escorted me out. Later when I was calling several people to talk to, it finally hit me that I had recorded the event on my phone without her knowing. 

Like I had full on forgot I had my phone secretly recording, cause my brain turned to mush during the event. The video helped me prove she was harassing me and I wasn‚Äôt just breaking down for nothing."
When I first started experiencing disassociation I really thought that I was losing my mind. Was absolutely terrified
I feel that before a panic attack and pure bliss and relaxation after a panic attack. Like thank god its gone.
At random too. I'll literally be fine one moment & then the next moment I'm filled with existential dread & I just want to lay down for the rest of the day.
This is the hardest thing to explain to someone who has never been through a panic attack. Bravo! Well said!
"I didnt know this was common. I'd never had a REAL panic attack until recently. Plenty of what I thought were panic attacks, but later realized were just acute anxiety, apparently. Anyways, after one particularly intense and terrible panic attack, I sat staring at all wall for a few hours. Not an exaggeration... I just couldnt do shit. I couldnt think, I couldnt feel, my phone was just sitting there buzzing in my hand from a friend that kept checking on me and I didnt even know what to say. Like yeah dude I'm good I'm just still looking at this wall and shit... but I couldnt help it if I tried. I felt so disconnected and physically exhausted from the panic, I don't even know how to articulate what I felt. I kinda felt nothing, I kinda glad that it 'ended', scared it would return, and kinda unsure of who I even was for that moment. When your brain and body go past those limits, it's a very strange sensation to realize how much ''you"" are dependent on your physical body, because no rationalization could have stopped that panic... it was physical."
I have a history of panic attacks and I‚Äôm diabetic. When my blood sugar gets too low before I realize it, I cannot tell the difference. I had to get out of the habit of just eating candy when I feel like that because sometimes I‚Äôd send my sugar through the roof because I thought my shit was low. Hard knock life.
I feel disconnected from my body. Like I‚Äôm a little guy driving a Gundam Robot of myself, looking out the windows of my eyes.
"I feel the dissociation before my anxiety attacks.

I found ways to get back in the moment. Focusing on physical sensations and even playing catch with a ball really help."
Had my first one a couple of weeks ago while driving home from work and had no idea what it was. I thought I was having a heart attack even though I'm young and healthy, so I pulled over and called 911 while much of the upper half of my body was numb and I was having trouble breathing. They showed up and said it seemed like an anxiety attack. Absolutely scary experience. I still have stress-related chest pain to this day that I'm not sure how to deal with.
I've gotten pretty good at controlling mine, but the thirty seconds I spend riding the edge of tripping into one or not are pretty awful.
I used to call bs on panic attacks and think they weren‚Äôt bad but it wasn‚Äôt until I got into college and school work started to stress me tf out I got my first panic attack. It was on the car and I felt all hot and like I wanted to go back home so bad, i felt like crying, something terrible would happen to everyone i knew, I would drop out of college but then it subsided after like 6 minutes and I realized that once I‚Äôm where I needed to be it would be ok. Shits scary yo
I'm sorry that happened to you. You should see a doctor if you haven't. This problem is very manageable.
"That's messed up, but typical. I hate it when people trivialize or disregard what you're trying to tell them because they think they know better, but is it really their fault? I think a proper neurotypical would have no frame of reference for these kinds of things, seeing as they'd likely have never experienced one.

Still, giving someone the benefit of the doubt with a side of empathy is important when dealing with these things. Sounds like their medical training is just as real as the mall cops' police training, if you ask me.

I hope things are better for you now. If not, I hope they *get* better."
"After my first panic attack (standard thought I was dying) I went to a clinic to make sure it wasn‚Äôt something more serious and to see if there was anything I should do. I could not have had a less caring, more abrasive nurse. I told her I thought I‚Äôd had a panic attack and she got this attitude like she thought I was lying. I think she was belittling me for trying to diagnose myself or something? Still not sure. 

Really wish I could say I told her off and walked out, but I was still really fragile and just said never mind, it must have just been in my head, and asked for a refill of a standard prescription.

Sucks ass when the people we look to for help are negligent with us."
Kinda like you just fell out of a plane but you're really just standing in line at the grocery store.
"First one I had, I thought I was having an allergic reaction to a dish at a restaurant. I got a ‚Äúpins and needles‚Äù feeling in my lips and face, and started to feel clammy and cold. This feeling scared me, and my parents started to panic themselves when they saw my discomfort, which only made things worse. My throat got tight, I felt like I couldn‚Äôt take in enough air despite trying my hardest to breath. I got incredibly light headed and my vision became blurry and bright, the tingling, numbing sensation spread through my whole body, I couldn‚Äôt feel my face - I genuinely, 100% with all my being, believed I would die. I was scared, I didn‚Äôt want that moment to be my last. It was a bizarre experience.

We were visiting a very fancy restaurant in a big city at the time; I had an ambulance called for me and a big fuss was made, first responders rushed in to get me out of the building. Looking back on it, I‚Äôm totally mortified to think that I interrupted other people‚Äôs dinners. After the first responders let me know I was having a panic attack and the tingling/numb feeling went away, I felt very at peace, almost giddy, and very tired. It is a very strange sensation; crazy how your mind can make you experience such a thing - I was not in danger, but my goodness, the fear was very, very real."
You genuinely feel like you're about to die. At least the first time anyway. My first proper time was in an exam hall full of people and I had to ride the wave until it went away. Not a good time.
"Different for everybody but it‚Äôs like an overload of stress and anxiety that short circuits your system and you just glitch out.  Like for me my vision gets blurry and I‚Äôll get tingling in my lips and fingers, then my heart beats fast and I can‚Äôt speak properly or think straight.  First time I thought it was a stroke.   

Then there‚Äôs derealization and depersonalization, so you feel like you‚Äôre completely disassociated from yourself, like you‚Äôre watching from the outside. 

Overall I don‚Äôt recommend it."
Like I'm being stabbed and bludgeoned repeatedly while falling off a cliff and there's people yelling at me
Bad. Like your body and brain and reality are on different planes and they don't like it. It gets hard to breathe, your heart just tries its best to beat like it's the last day on earth.
Yeah, it's like tug of war. You want it go out. You put your time into it. When it's about to go out. You lose energy and you take a breath. Then, it goes back in. üò∂
"This happened to me in a hotel in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was easily the nicest hotel bathroom I had ever dueced in, 5 star Ritz collection hotel. 

I was shitting but nothing was going in the toilet, presumably just filling my asscrack with spackle. Wiping was futile I had to shower immediately. I don't want to go into detail of that shower but it was also futile. 

After getting out I needed to use a bath towel just to wipe the remnants. That towel looked like it came straight from hell. 

To avoid embarrassment I throw the towel out the open window of my suite only to realize there was a ledge below the window. The shit-stained towel landed on the ledge below and it was too far down for me to grab. My room was marked with the brown stain of shame for the entire week I stayed there.

It happened only once to me before that, in a tiny ski cabin where my ski boots prevented me from a full spread in the tiny phone-booth sized loo."
I know you are joking but that is actually extremely bad for your (edit-) buttox. You shouldn‚Äôt push to hard or it can really mess your stomach, giving you things like hemorrhoids (straining  is a actually the number one cause of hemorrhoids) and stuff. If you really need to push that much it means you need more fiber and water.
"Treadmills had a similar timewarp. 

*Running, currently at 0.97 miles*

""Okay, I'm not going to look back at the display until I'm at least over 1 mile""

*listen to a whole song and watch half an episode of Sportscenter. Watch someone outside who definitely walked .03 miles at a much slower speed.*

*Check display again as it ticks up from 0.97 to 0.98*

Well at least I burned *squints* 6 calories. WTF."
You need a song with an epic climax, i was able to go from 2 minutes to 2 and a half minutes by timing Colussus by Idles just right so that the climax starts around the point where i would usually give up
"I did. 3 minute plank after a long time, and I had a timer, so I was trying to count the last 30 seconds.
I counted to 30 almost twice... Crazy."
The secret is to take deep breaths, 3 seconds in, 3 seconds out, all of a sudden you're a minute deep and can do the next one.
It, in fact, is! Those who have mastered the delicate art of the plank have achieved the ability to time travel, or at least the WILL achieve it
Two days ago I found something that's worse than plank and wall sitting. Lying on your back and lifting your legs slightly to engage your lower abs. We did one minute of it in between shadow boxing rounds in training and I swear, it was the longest minute of my life
The worst day of high-school track was definitely doing wall sits, passing a 5 pound ball back and forth between two state finalist/winning hurdlers for about 2 minutes straight.
"There's this excercise my PT got me to do. You use one of the pulley machines (like for rows I guess) but you stand arms up, wrists crossed. Then open your arms whilst keeping them straight all the way back.

Reverse fly's? Maybe...anyway I think it basically uses this tiny muscle in your shoulder blades somewhere - something thats normally pretty tense If you have a desk job and rarely 'worked out'

I can do like 1 kg on each arm. It's ridiculous. Ten reps feels like forever.

"I wish I could give you gold!! My first thought was, ""The last push. The one when you aren't sure if your clitoris is going to split up the middle, or if you are going to get stitches just above your asshole."""
Gonna try that, I can plank for 2 and half mins and it sucks doing them end but I never get sore no more this might help mix it up.

*proceed to freeze on seat while the sex scene plays*"
hey what's that in the other room? oh it's not sex scene when my parents are sitting beside me, definitely got to check that out
"Oh god i know what you mean just on a slightly different level. Watchment is one of my all time favorites. The last time we watched it i had just come home after surgery to remove cervical cancer and i literally started sweating when that scene came on because my husband (god rest him) would always end up wanting to fool around whenever he watched that part. I was informed that sexy time was forbidden for eight weeks while i heal. Im only 31 so not wanting to have sex wasn't really a thing for me until then. Luckily he just put his arm around me and said ""heh, thats going to be you in eight weeks"" lol."
Man, I marathoned the TV series that came out about a year ago with my dad and I think I spent 4/5 of my time totally confused because I had zero context going in, and 1/5 wanting to melt into a puddle because of all of the sex scenes
You guys remember that 1guy1horse video where the dude actually died from getting plowed by a horse cock?
What kind of hardcore porno are you watching that shows a fucking gigantic dong in full penetration??
Oh christ. This happened to me back when it was kind of new. I was sat in the living room with my parents and the first thing you see is walt getting a birthday handy from skyler. I sat through the whole thing in silence, and then walked out immediately after.
Was trying to convince my mom to give Bojack Horseman a shot after talking it up for so long... Forgot about the sex scene in the first episode. Whoops.
This is random but why do I feel like breaking bad is over hyped. The first episode is so good but then after that it‚Äôs not
"Not if you're a sadist.  As a teen I rented ""The Basketball Diaries"".  My dad kept fast forwarding when they started cursing a lot, but the scene where an old man pays to suck teen Leo DiCaprio's dick in a bathroom stall? Oh, he watched every agonizing second of that knowing that it was only I who was agonized, and he enjoyed it."
You must've gotten someone who didn't overfill the tray, but they usually do. I had to get molds done last week, and it was the first time in my life that I didn't feel like I was going to suffocate or drown from goo going down my throat.
"Sorry you know that shock man. And it's weird it doesn't really get mentioned ahead of time. And, I wanna say with another birth it didn't happen that way, so, who knows if it's rare. I just remember having that same unexpected terror, that might have only lasted a few seconds but felt like a life time. Glad yours and mine were both fine though.

Be well dude."
Yeah they should mention this in the obgyn office in one of your prenatal appointments. The birthing process can already be stressful, why add to it?
you should watch Call the Midwife, very realistic portrayals of birth, a lot of them use a mucus extractor to clear baby's airways before it can breathe.
"My story is so similar. My son was born with the cord around his neck, and he was grey and lifeless. They took him over to the corner and huddled around him, can't have been much more than 30 seconds and I just kept saying ""is he breathing?"" over and over until finally they said he was, he didn't cry though, not until after he was dressed and I left the room to have a shower."
"My youngest daughter (twin B) was grey and not moving when she was born (VBAC with vacuum assist for twin B) and my husband thought she was dead.  They placed her on my chest before they cut the cord and I was so scared because she looked nothing like her brother who they placed there just 15min prior.
She ended up being fine but we were not prepared."
"&#x200B;

Just before I started actively pushing in labor, my doctor told me that not all babies scream and cry when they first come out. So when she was about halfway out and she wasn't crying yet, he reminded me ""Remember how I told you not all babies cry? This is okay"". Was very nice to get that heads up and the reminder. It would be nice if all OBGYNs did this."
The same thing happened with my kid, the stuff they took out was meconium (poop). Apparently it's common for blobs of poop to float around in the amniotic fluid and wind up in the baby's lungs,so they have to suck it out. Like you, I found the wait terrifying.
My son smiled and then I passed out. I was told he cried. I can't stand the thought of him crying, he's 23 now ;)
I started reading this thinking you were the mom and then when you said you walked to the station I was like ‚ÄúHOW?‚Äù
I was my sisters support person when she gave birth to my nephew 4 months ago. She labored for 18 hours before finally having an emergency c-section because the babies heart rate was dropping rapidly. I remember standing in the hallway in full scrubs because there was no time for them to let me in the room, panicking because nobody had time to tell me anything. I started sobbing the moment I heard him cry and knew he was okay.
I think they use some kind of suction or I'm sure my midwife mum said they use their finger to scoop it out. They get their oxygen from the placenta until it's cut which buys you a bit of time! Sounds terrifying though!!
My mom had such a visceral reaction to my firstborn not immediately crying that she had a hesrt attack. I had to see them pulling out my mom on a stretcher while recovering from the shock of seeing my son come out blue. They are both okay now and my son is six!
I had a similar situation when my son was born they had to suction out his lungs. They told us ahead of time but it was the longest 30 seconds waiting for his cry.
I was the first born of my parents, and I came out quiet as well. Only difference was that the umbilical cord was wrapped around my neck and I was purple from lack of oxygen
Same thing happened to me except my son started breathing super fast once he took a breath and never cried. He ended up in the NICU for a few days so they could monitor his breathing, but it ended up calming down on his own and now, 3 years later, he is fine. It was a very weird detached experience that I still can‚Äôt fully process. Just like this weird fog around the memory. That whole moment felt like hours.
Im a dumbass. It took me way too long to figure out how you walked over to the doctor after giving birth haha.
">I was irrationally and extremely angry at the entertainment industry for not portraying what birth is actually like

Yeah, Hollywood needs to work better on making hospital scenes more realistic.

I remember seeing a video where someone was explaining to his friends that defibrillators don't restart the heart (they stop the heart and you wait for the heart to restart on its own), and they refused to believe him."
"My daughter is now 19 months and this was the exact same thing for me. Nothing like the movies. 

&#x200B;

My wife is a nurse and even though she said ""if the doctor and nurses aren't freaking out, everything's fine"", I was still just so desperate to see her take a breath, anything. I went blank for what seemed like an eternity, just wanting my kid to breathe. The doctor grabbed her and took her to a little table across the room. Then they scooped some stuff out of her mouth & throat and she started breathing. After that, I was really scared for some reason, still in shock I guess, and the doctor had to tell me it was okay to come and look at her."
"I would have sworn blind it took my eldest about a minute, 2 at most, before the Docs got her breathing. Turns out it was 8.5 minutes. I only found out when I read the discharge letter properly! (She's totally fine now).

It's strange what shock will do to your perception of time."
"Yes! Our second probably took about 45 seconds to make a noise, she had a lot of stuff still in her mouth and the midwives were doing the same as you described. Every 0.0001 of a second I was saying ""cry, cry, please cry, cry please."" I had just pushed her out but I had zero awareness of anything outside of every fiber of my being willing her to give me a sign she was ok. I felt like the entire world disappeared and nothing outside of not hearing her cry existed. Mad relief to hear it. Of course she now has made up for that and screaches at the top of her 13 month old lungs!"
When I was born I was born still in the amniotic sac and not breathing on top of that I was born three months early and was pretty small but things are fine sorry you had to go through that shock...
"Can confirm. One of my babies was born in distress after a serious sudden issue with the birth. Came out completely purple gray and silent. The whole entire world stopped and it felt like I was both floating and being buried in cement. He needed resuscitation and to this day I have no idea how long it was but it felt like an eternity. Someone finally had the good grace to say ""we've got a heartbeat"" but I could barely hear from the blood rushing around in my head. Even after he started breathing, he didn't cry out. It was more like a shocked whimper before he snuggled up to mom and fell asleep, probably exhausted from the whole ordeal. Logically I know it didn't take years but I'm certain I aged a decade that afternoon."
"Similar experience for me. I was holding my wife's hand and looking over at where they took our daughter and they looked stressed. I saw her come out looking rather blue and I my mind went ""Well she's dead. Fuck. Omg how bad is my wife going to take this?"" 

Then the midwife walked over and plonked her on my wife's chest (still not crying or making any sound) and says ""congrats guys she's perfect"".
Wife can't see the baby because she's laying between her breasts and she starts freaking out about no crying. 

They really should warn you about that.

For the next year we have been doing everything we can to stop the constant noise and crying..."
"My wife was induced because an ultrasound revealed that my son had pooped. Sure enough, 13 hours later he popped out and was covered in the grossest, thickest black poop you‚Äôve ever seen.the moment he pops out the doctor abruptly says ‚Äúthick meconium‚Äù, and the nurses rush him over to the table. Not crying , not breathing, they get him over to that little table and they are suctioning him and have that oxygen saturation monitor on him. It felt like it took FOREVER  for it to get above 90. I‚Äôm sure it was less than a minute. I cried. I didn‚Äôt think he was going to make it and I had to look back at my wife and tell her he was okay. Longest minute of my life. 

Anyway he turns a year old this month and is super healthy and a total goofball."
If I had to guess, that machine was probably a heating table. They put my son on it when he was born 3 months ago. I do love this story though, because of how accurately it depicts that early parenthood panic you get when something isn‚Äôt right. I had a similar experience the first time I saw my son; I didn‚Äôt think he was mine. He had red hair and just looked funny. Three months later, he looks like a tony version of me! Congrats, dad!
"I'm a pediatrician who has attended many deliveries. The waiting for the cry is terrifying for us too- since if you have a physician at the delivery it's likely a high-risk delivery- otherwise nurses usually attend them. It can take up to 30 seconds for a cry, but really we want babies to cry as soon as possible and most cry within a few seconds, that is why they were probably vigorously rubbing and drying the baby in the warmer- stimulate and make baby upset so he cries. The stuff in the mouth was probably amniotic fluid (remember baby has never breathed air before). Suctioning is usually the very first step and often happens before the baby is even all the way out!  In meconium deliveries (where the baby poops in the womb before birth) that stuff can actually cause some severe lung problems.

&#x200B;

FUn fact- They really did use to hold babies upside down and spank them to make them cry and drain the fluid from the lungs!"
"That sounds like the most terrifying roller coaster :(

Hope everything turned out for the best. *hug*"
"Similar story... I had a miscarriage last fall at twelve weeks. I‚Äôm currently pregnant again and nearing the final few weeks and everything is going as well as can be (the third trimester is rough no matter what). At my obgyn office there‚Äôs this one nurse I do not like. She did my vitals and did the dopler scan for the baby‚Äôs heartbeat at my twenty five week appointment. This was just about the time I was kind of starting to relax and let go of the fear of losing another one. So, she‚Äôs doing the dopler and has a really hard time finding the baby‚Äôs heartbeat. In like the least sensitive way possible she goes ‚Äúwell, I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm just not hearing anything. How far along did you say you thought you were?‚Äù I was on edge for like an entire day after that.

Turns out the baby was just hiding off to the side of my uterus and kinda high. She kept trying to find him kinda low and center. This isn‚Äôt that unusual. Other nurses have sometimes had trouble finding his heartbeat at first too. They‚Äôll just say ‚Äúoh, he‚Äôs running from me today‚Äù or something like that instead of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything‚Äù."
I'm so happy it worked out okay. I hope everyone healed up good and you guys are all happy and healthy now.
"Anyone who went through it knows, you nurses make all the difference.

The doctor gets the fun part and glory, but you make the whole thing work.

Thanks."
It would be. I'm sure he captured it like a poem. It is a beautiful moment, you know, when it works out. :)
"I can't speak for everyone, but for myself and everyone else in my unit that I've seen get tased, no. It makes your superficial muscles contract, so I don't think it causes any contractions in the bowels. 

One of the guys who went after me grabbed and twisted his safety's dick though. Fun times."
"Better than when my dad signed me up for a debit card as a teenager. He had stored all my saved money. 

I was front of the line at GameStop and it asked for a pin. 

I knew I was fucked, but I asked, ""Should I know that?""

Employee said yeah with alllll the judgment.

I turned into a tomato and said ""Never mind"" and left the store. -_-"
"All these babies in the thread going ""oh the 30sec when you're waiting for someone to get out of the bathroom so you can pee"" meanwhile ""papsmears"" was absolutely my first thought."
My husband is a physician so does pap smears. I always tell him, don't be afraid of the lube. More lube, more better. It should be dripping on the floor! I don't want to feel any friction from that speculum.
"I have to get tested monthly as part of my job- yes, it's uncomfortable, but no it's not the worst in the world. Assuming your technician is doing it right, it's about the same as getting water up your nose at the pool/wherever.

...getting water up your nose is slightly worse though, because you can't necessarily be sure of being safe after and that lil moment of panic is not fun. With a COVID swab you can see and talk to the tech."
Pap smears don't bother me but getting your membranes stripped at the end of a pregnancy is quite uncomfortable.
Got the nasal swab done as I was being admitted to deliver my second child, I was also in the last stage of labor. I don't know which one was more uncomfortable.
Honestly it‚Äôs not that bad. It makes your eyes water and it makes you cough, but it looks so much worse than it is.
They do both???? Damn. Where I live they just stick it down your throat for a sec and then they go up one nostril, not both....
Yeah I have found that it varies. First test I took I was like ‚Äúoh hey, not as bad as I thought, just very ticklish!‚Äù Second test I took the woman basically raped my nostrils, to the point where it felt like I was going to get a nosebleed. It hurt for like 20 minutes afterwards.
"I thought this comment was still in reply to pap smears so of course when I read ""first nostril"" I was all sorts of feelings"
"I had to get a nasal swab covid test, and I wish I had a picture of my face after the first nostril was done and the person administrating the test said, ""alright, time for the next one!"""
And they have to jab it in there like some kind of fucking barbarian. Like, we aren't fighting in the arena in Rome here, you are swabbing my nose.
i just got mine done like an hour ago and it really wasn‚Äôt that bad. it‚Äôs a bit uncomfortable but not as bad as people say imo
"It depends on the person who gets tested. If your nasalgang is on the narrower side it feels like hell. They push it in, when you think they are there they suddenly push it even deeper (this is when you feel the urge to sneeze and when your eye gets watery), and then they twist it a few times and pull it out.

I wouldn't say it hurts, but it is extremely anoying and I smelled blood afterwards."
I've gotten 2 of these tests in the past week, and it honestly wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's uncomfortable but over really fast
I asked the individual administering my test how it was, she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs... unpleasant,‚Äù and in my life I have never had someone be so immediately correct. It‚Äôs not painful. It‚Äôs not awful. It‚Äôs just.. unpleasant.
I haven't had a COVID test, but I had one for MRSA before I had surgery last year. The swab has to go pretty far back in your nose. The best way to describe it is like a really uncomfortable tickling sensation way too far back in your nose, but it really doesn't hurt. Your body pretty much knows there shouldn't be anything that far in your nose, and my response was that my eyes started watering like crazy because they did it for what felt like a minute (but in reality was probably 10-15 seconds.) That was similar to a flu test that I had last year, but it wasn't as deep and didn't last as long.
I had to get tested for swine flu back in the day and it was the same test. Middle school me was in tears
"Uh. I didn‚Äôt know there was a throat swab option. 


I gag just from trying to brush my tongue on a daily basis so I guess I should be okay with how horrible the nasal swab is instead."
That sounds horrifying.  I was overly confident going for the COVID test because I‚Äôve had many laryngoscopes (tube goes up your nose and down your windpipe).  But I do get a numbing nose spray first and that makes a difference.  Having the tube down to your stomach for a whole day sounds awful.
At my university, UIUC, we have to get tested twice a week and it‚Äôs just a saliva based test. So you only have to spit in a cup and they process the results from that. It‚Äôs very quick and easy.
Sometimes the local anesthetic or nerve block doesn‚Äôt kick, whether it wasn‚Äôt administered properly, or you‚Äôre a bit more resistant than others.
Reminds me of a story.  My coworker went out on a solo hunting trip a couple years back, and as he was getting out of his truck his boot got caught and he fell.  He wasn't able to get his arms out to stop him, so he hit the ground teeth first.  Now falling flat on your face sucks under any circumstances.  Falling flat on your face from a raised pickup truck onto bitumen fucking DESTROYS you.  He woke up an indeterminate amount of time later missing front teeth, his nose broken, glasses smashed, and flap of his face hanging off.  He had no cell reception and was too concussed to drive, so he used the super glue in his console to glue his face flap back into place.  Then spent the night in his truck until morning when he felt well enough to drive himself to the hospital.
Not at all, as long as you weren't actively trying to get pregnant. In that case, that would be a strange response.
Hell no. Had a GF need to take one when I was 19. When it was negative we both did laps around the kitchen chanting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not fucked! We‚Äôre not fucked!‚Äù
Last month, I was nauseated for a full week, my back aches, my boobs hurt...but my tubes are tied. I wasn‚Äôt worried. Period was due in a week. It wasn‚Äôt until I realized I couldn‚Äôt recall my last cup of coffee that I started almost panicking (with both of my kids, I lost all taste for coffee). Then like 4 hours later, my period showed up. Like...fuck you, body.
My girlfriend will also start freaking out saying ‚ÄúI see a second line. Can‚Äôt you see it? It‚Äôs faint but it‚Äôs there, oh my god the line is there.‚Äù Meanwhile there is no line. After 3 tests she finally agrees there‚Äôs probably no line, thankfully.
I was 95% sure we were good (I always wear protection) but her period was missed by like five days! I finally convinced her to take a test and my blood pressure was through the roof because it felt like she was pregnant having been so late. Of course it was negative. I was still on edge though until she had her period... the very next day.
"Sometimes my period will be like a week late so i just tell my husband i need to waste ten bucks so my period will start.

Go store, waste ten bucks, get a negative and the within 24 hours my body will manage to work again lol. Dont ask me why but it works."
Eh, that's totally subjective. I know some parents who do not believe having children is amazing, and I'm sure those kids would be happier with parents who felt differently.
"Or, you know, emotionally crushed because you've been trying for a very long time and were desperately hoping for a positive this time.

This is one of those things where the situation of the individuals drastically change the response."
You're being downvoted because people suck, but we're trying for our second baby right now and this can definitely be true. Just depends on the circumstances! I would love to see a positive right now, but each month I get that damn negative and I'm sad
Birth control can fail. Why does everybody assume that people aren't using birth control? Like, shit happens, even if they use it right. Some outside factor could make it ineffective.
"Sometimes it goes like that, sometimes it takes time for people to see it, and sometimes you post in on a different platform and people see it. Try not to focus on the one piece. Even if it is the best in the world, you'll be able to make another better track. People are usually polite and say that but unless they actually care about it, or you emphasise how important this is to you, they won't actually check it out :(

Drop your track! I wanna hear it"
I bet. I had heart surgery two years ago and they had to do a blood gas test (I think that‚Äôs what it was called) where they have to find an artery instead of a vein. Anyway, dude started in (at my wrist) and hit a nerve. OH MY GOD. Never experienced pain like that ever! I hit the gurney and tears started all by themselves. But I actually felt bad for the tech because he didn‚Äôt do it on purpose and just kept apologizing and wincing right along with me. I‚Äôm like, dude it‚Äôs alright, keep going let‚Äôs get it done.
when you take a deep breathe and inside go ‚Äúplease get the vein please get the vein please please‚Äù pretending to be calm in front of the patient lmao
"We are not legally obligated to, but we are drilled to recite what we are doing for patient information and comfort. Some people find it really helpful to know what‚Äôs happening, but I also understand and respect requests to just do it without the speech. 

(Although you DO need to stay still so if I‚Äôm not going to be telling you you need to understand that and keep your arm super duper still, ok? Ok cool.)"
We are most certainly not legally obligated to tell you how we're performing the venipuncture, but individuals are ethically obligated because the greater population are very much like children when it comes to needles and require thorough reassurance
Can confirm I have a big fear of needles so I never want to know anything just get it done and leave me out of it, this is in the UK tho so don't know if different in other places.
My best friend was like this with needles. Couldn‚Äôt watch it in movies like you. Diagnosed with leukemia at age 22. She became a pin cushion. AND they messed up the first bone marrow extraction. (In remission 8 years later, PTSD, goes to a lot of therapy)
I had a nurse push the needle in, realize she went all the way through the vein, pull it out to far, wiggle the tip of the needle blindly, push it all the way through the vein _again_, and finally pull back and hit the actual vein. By the end I was making growling noises, mentally cursing her out, and the next day my arm was half-covered in the most lurid bruise I‚Äôve ever seen. It was incredibly unpleasant.
"I apparently have nightmarish veins and regularly have to have 3 or 4 people try to get an IV in. And then once it's in it usually ""blows"" within a couple of hours. Last time I was in hospital I had 5 IVs in one day. They've also started taking blood samples from my feet instead of my arms. Stupid tiny veins."
Came here to say this. I feel like the ‚Äúpinch‚Äù of the giant needle of novocaine is the single worst part of a dentist visit.
That would suck. I think I saw it on here, but there‚Äôs a machine they have now that emits some type of light that basically highlights your veins through the skin so they don‚Äôt have to hunt and peck all the time.
My first IV, I have very large veins on my hands and wrists. The nurse tied my arm off, then two of them stood to the side and started betting who could get the larger gauge needle in my vein. Hey dipshits, you know I can hear you right? FWIW - they were Army nurses, the civilian ones at least leave the room when they‚Äôre placing bets.
I feel that. The first time they drew blood, I was twelve and it took her 2 tries and 30 minutes. The only reason I didn't hit her was I was more concerned about breathing. (Asthma with bronchitis).
One of the worst ones I ever had was going down a slide in a Halloween house, being chased. I'll never forget that one.
He must have a Consitution score of like 8, otherwise his unarmored defense bonus would easily protect him from zipper damage. What an awful barbarian build.
Hey, I wear boxers half the time and boxer briefs the other half. I have a pair of boxers with batman's face right where the hole in the boxers are, so when my dick plops out the hole it looks like Batman has a dick nose, like Dan Aykroyd in Nothing But Trouble. When you where boxers, sometimes dick nose happens, and when it does, zipping is a God damn existential crisis.
"It‚Äôs happened to me like once that‚Äôs it. Most shorts have a cloth flap guarding the zipper from your junk.
But I also wear underwear so that‚Äôs something to consider as well"
I thought so too. It has only happened to me once, when i was a young kid, and i still dont own any jeans.
Actually happened to me when I was a kid. Ended up having a surprise blowjob by our next door neighbor trying to bite off the zipper.
"I wondered why that guy looked so disappointed when he put his hand out and said ""give me some skin"". I thought he just wanted a high five..."
I've had one. The worst part is the doctor just going in. No time to relax and get used to it. Just in and out. Since your initial reaction is to clench, it makes it uncomfortable.
I feel like it took me only like a week to get used to it. It could be because I had some extra kilos on me (90kg at 187cm) but starting it was definitely not hard at all surprisingly. I haven't felt hungry once since then, I've only eaten because I've forced myself to do it, not because I've been hungry.
Please no one listen to this guy, even if what he says is true, 30 hits can do serious psychological damage.
It served me valiantly for six and a half years, and then I had it yanked out so I could make a baby. I've heard the IUD baby horror stories though!
"One of the first things that popped into my head when someone mentioned planks.

Between planks, wall-sits, and dying cockroaches, 30 seconds feel like a lifetime."
I nearly drowned. What im talking about here specifically is something that happened when i was 6, the ground under me broke and down i went. The ground broke under me and i fell into the water. The fall and the cold of the water hit like a brick and everything seemed to move at slowmotion. Think Slowmo guys if you ever seen one of their videos
True, but kids are terrible creatures so I wasn‚Äôt comfortable presenting whether I was prepared or not. It wasn‚Äôt until somewhat recently that my fear of presenting has gone away.
Haha, no. I should have clarified it better. After I pour the oil in such conditions, then I go to the basement(which isn‚Äôt really warm either) to bleed the furnace.
Dude same. They asked me if i wanted xannax for the procedure and said no. A lady was holding my hand while i was crushing a stress ball on the other.  I was stressed af. Although i hope i always remember the kaleidoscopic effect i was seing while my cornea was being fixed. A very once in a lifetime effect
"Must be nice living in some sort of fancy mansion, or pan-dimensional dwelling where it takes 30 seconds to run to the fridge. Or

It was must be really terrible to move that slowly that it takes you that long to run to the fridge in a normal-sized house. If so, I'm sorry. If not, fuck you."
Ask about things that are difficult or painful, people ate going to talk about the pain that's in the highest office.
"Not really. Ask reddit is one of the few popular subreddits that i am glad isn't infested with vociferous comments on how much they hate the president and America.

Its cool, you can hate the president and the country so much that you pop veins every day but I'd very much appreciate it if you took your comments and energy to r/politics, r/news, r/pics, r/blackpeopletwitter, etc"
The last thing I saw were headlamps of my motorcycle shining into my eyes while I was sliding on asfalt ...then I hit curb back-first....the first thing was to check if I could move my whole body .... lucky me ...I could ...twas but a scratch on my knee ...so deep I could see the actual knee inside ...but nothing broken
"Well yeah I would love to fall for an hour also.
But it felt way longer than I had expected is the point"
Indianapolis here! I do deliveries so I‚Äôm always driving and personally, there‚Äôs always been someone that‚Äôll let you first
If you worry about proving how big your dick is to a man in his sixties that‚Äôs fondling your balls, that‚Äôs hella ducking weird, but go right ahead
I'm going to save this, because it sounds like a good allegory for something post-modern that is considered normal, that everyone goes along with, but is really twisted.
"This EXACT thing happened to me as a kid aside from one difference. I came up in a double inner-tube right next to another kid who just looked at me like ""wtf?"", but I just took a glance around long enough to dive back under and resurface outside of the tube. I don't think I even bothered saying anything because I was so glad to have air. I vaguely feel as if I was just pissed because it felt like the people were literally just pushing me back down until I forced myself up."
"Well, it's literally called ""Drowning Simulator.""

Look it up. I don't think the site is up anymore, but there are tons of videos on Youtube."
God that makes me think of Naya Rivera. She apparently was a very strong swimmer and she still drowned.
"I had this issue a couple times, then I asked my dentist if he had anything else. He said he did, and he gave me novacaine and something else. 2 shots. Completely numbed everything. I bet he could have taken a jackhammer to my mouth and I wouldn't have felt it lol. Maybe yours has another type as well?

That or maybe he just doubled up on the novacaine and lied to me about it but idk why he'd do that."
"I was told I had to have it done months ago. When it got infected. Fuuuuck. I couldn't get it treated for 2 weeks because of Covid. Worst 2 weeks of my life. The root canal was nothing compared to the infection pains. Only thing that made those go away was jack daniels, both on a cotton ball in the mouth and with a shot glass.

I have to have another root canal though on my right molar and I'm putting that shit off to the last minute because I'm retarded and didn't learn from my mistakes."
Yeah but it was like $400 more to do it with novocaine and it didnt hurt bad enough for that. Also right after that he was done drilling so it would‚Äôve been useless anyway.
Damn that's crazy. I was in Vegas when those earthquakes hit California last summer, and we only got a small part of it but damn it was crazy. Lying in bed extremely hungover on the 30th floor of a hotel when the building started to shake was a very new experience coming from somewhere that has zero earthquakes. I was too hungover to get out of bed and accepted that this might be the end.
Yeah I was in the Northridge earthquake but then you casually drop 8.8... fuck man. That must have been terrifying.
Oh, absolutely true and not pedantic.  At the time, 26 years ago at this point, it was still the common recommendation.  Things have changed since then.  That earthquake changed a lot of things about our thinking on construction and reaction procedures.  Still, it's a hard habit I don't get that often to practice trying to break (fortunately).
That one was wild. I spent 5 years in california but still haven't been through one like the one in VA.
"Slept in my car for the first few nights afterwards.  Only place I could mentally rationalize the aftershocks as I was used to my car vibrating while I was driving, so I could sleep.  Also, I knew that there was nothing that was going to cave in on me if I was in my car out on the street.

You were probably near me, I was 3 miles from the epicenter.  I live even closer now.  eek.

Stay strong."
It got freaky days and weeks afterwards as I found things like mugs and books from top shelves on my walls in the closed bottom draws of my dressers, when I finally did go back into the room after a day or so.  Had to sort through everything to try to figure out where everything came from and went.  The shelves being taken off the walls was one of the first changes I made before I could sleep in the room again.
Try being 3 miles from the epicenter and getting out of the house to find that the street your house was on had erupted into a geyser on one side of your block and a tower of flame bursting from the other side.  It seemed like the end of the world at the time.
"Well, ""they're"" claiming it was a 6.7 now, and that it was 20 seconds, but whats 1 second here or there."
"Funny thing is, you are not all that wrong.  Having experienced it and having seen what larger earthquakes cause in death and destruction, 6.8 is ""mild"", though I would prefer to never go through one that big, that close again (lived 3 miles from the epicenter, at the time)."
It works the same way as if you were drinking water whilst doing a handstand. The important clue is that your head is upside down. When that is achieved, just drink the water. Works 100% anytime anyplace.
Honestly same. The first time you do it the feeling is like the distilled essence of woah what the fuck was that
"I'm a really tall with really long arms. I had to fold my arms up in some crazy position to get something scanned. Felt arms going numb about 1 minute into it. Arms went numb then compeletely dead in 5. Still had 20 minutes to go.

*Might have been longer than 20 minutes, it was a long time ago and I had given up hope."
It's actually a common problem for people where we are so averse to inconveniencing other people that, when choking to death, lots of people will walk away from crowds of others who could help and just die alone
Quite conversely the whole four minutes I was in one I just wanted to wave my head around furiously and hopefully everyone would laugh and they‚Äôd show me the insane images.
"my only mri they asked me if there was a specific music I wanted to listen to, I named a band (in hindsight is was kinda obscure) and instead I spent an hour listening to early 2000's boy bands





it was pain"
I have to wonder if this is MRI dept humor, or if somebody actually did a study on what helped people feel better.   Maybe slow music isn't it.
Oh man, I had a CT scan for the first time yesterday, and they injected me with the contrast dye via IV, and that was truly hellish. I felt like my body was on fire, i physically hurt, and i couldn't breathe. Cue instant panic attack.
i told them to play me some classical piano last scan i had. i made the mistake of telling them to play me the pop channel the time before. but the worst is when you‚Äôre close to falling asleep and then the tech comes in on the headphones like ‚Äúyo you okay in there?‚Äù like yeah! shut up!
When I had an MRI, they gave me headphones to listen to some calming classical music. As I slid slowly into the metal horror tube they played [Duel of the Fates](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xlYCxbBZUCY) from Star Wars. My heart was going like a jackhammer.
Last time I had an MRI they asked what kind of music I listen to and I said anything. They started playing bluegrass and I realized I don't listen to anything.
My last MRI turned into two MRIs because they somehow forgot to add the contrast the first time around and had to call me back
It makes me feel queasy when that flushed feeling starts! One time they injected it super fast and I could feel it burning up my arm.... that one was not fun. (I‚Äôve had a LOT of CT scans in the past year)
"Oh I absolutely get that I should not have been moving, my problem wasn't necessarily with the machine itself and I did try and move when it was quiet cuz I figured that meant nothing was happening, but the problem was that I just had a traumatic brain injury and so I basically kept thinking I was going to die if I wasn't tapping wood or tapping my head so I kept tapping my head. I wish I had like a wood bracelet or slab or wood chip just text my hand so it would just be fingers tapping instead of me actually moving proper

I'm saying this because I do understand it was really important that I stay still, it just also was not possible

Although thank you for this further insight into why I needed to stay still"
"Fun thing, the first time I had to drink contrast, or whatever, I actually started to faint, I informed people who were waiting in the room with me, that I need them to call the nurses. I was already losing it, the nurse came with a wheelchair and I was taken to the main part of the hospital, because they thought I could be allergic to the contrast, or something, which is very rare, but could kill me. Idk, I don't remember most of what they were telling me. My PVC was also super uncomfortable, but the nurse took a lot and was like ""meh, to me it looks fine"", well, cool, it doesn't feel fine though... But that's Poland right here for you. I spent 4h with PVC that hurt every time I moved my arm.

And about the contrast - I was fine. I just drank it too fast and I didn't eat or drink anything at all before, so my body just didn't really like it. Next time I had a tea before and took it slower."
Oh god.... yeah ketamine... last time they hit me woth 10mg and then followed woth another 4 of klonapin via IV... the headaches like holy shit
better to actually wake them up if it's really bad. You can fuck yourself up by throwing/diarrhea too much that you need medical attention. And if you do, you'll be too weak to yell and barely be able to crawl.
I think it's a reference to the other guy's username, however absolutely on board with 'how horny is that rhino' as a phrase to mean something's a bit much
Ouch, beer is hell for the stomach, thank god I hate it. I'd much rather whiskey or vodka. For me it's eating pizza, that kills my stomach like crazy.
"I don‚Äôt generally go looking for food poisoning but I‚Äôll keep it in mind :P

The culprit of my pain was a mushroom Swiss burger at a place I had never been before, and I was the only one that ordered it. So we‚Äôll never know if it truly was food poisoning or if my stomach just did a big ole NOPE"
"Especially if you‚Äôre a fan of dresses. I spent way too much money on dresses during quarantine and only two of the dresses I bought had pockets.  
  
On a side note I bought a pair of capris at target back in July. I went to put something in my pocket and my hand *kept going*. Like the front pockets goes down to roughly the middle of my thigh. It was a very pleasant surprise, only I still rarely use the front pockets *because* they‚Äôre so big. It just feels so unnatural at this point."
lol that‚Äôs what i do. then, after an anxious speedwalk to my car i put everything in it‚Äôs proper place and can breathe again.
"The smart kind

I'll probably be more of an animal when I say that I refuse to carry change. I will throw it on the ground before I carry it in my wallet"
This is true, I usually find crumbled up dollar bills when I'm doing laundry do at the end of the night
I'm lucky enough that I've never gotten big bills back. Only up to like 20s and I put those back as soon as I can
That's facts. I try to be the least annoying that I can, and people that are somehow surprised they're paying
"Thanks for making me check if my bank now accepted digital pay on my phone. Now I can use my Samsung phone anywhere to pay for stuff (well, except for the gas station, since it's difficult to get my phone into the card slot).

Now I'll need to get ready for the cashiers who'll eventually say ""oh, we don't accept Apple Pay here"" and enjoy their surprised Pikachu faces when my payment is accepted."
That used to bother me too, but then I started practicing having an ounce of patience and my life got much less stressful
You sound real angry over something so minor. I put it straight in my pockets, but damn you can handle five-10 seconds of someone putting it back in their wallet it‚Äôs not a big deal lmao
What?!  What about old ladies. I respect old people and try to never get impatient with them, but at the grocery store they wait til all the groceries are scanned the cashier says 88.26$, and THEN they start opening their purse for their card. Or.....they have 2 $50s in their hand, and then say ‚Äúoh, I think I have .26 somewhere in here‚Äù and zip open the purse, then fumble for the wallet, then say ‚Äúoh, I don‚Äôt have it‚Äù.  Sorry for the rant.
How about you just relax like a ‚Äúnormal human‚Äù and wait a minute or 2? Jesus Christ you sound insufferable.
I'm that guy. If waiting 20 seconds for me to put my shit away the way I want it you should shop on Amazon. You probably tailgate people hoping that they will drive faster too, huh? I  purposefully slow down for your kind
"I used to get really angry about this until I found myself ranting about it while driving home one day and getting angrier and angrier and then I realized some things.

1. I was the one suffering now. Not them. They can't hear me ranting, they don't even know I exist. I'm only working myself up and making myself angry. It's 0 punishment to them, only to me. Why am I doing this to myself?

2. I can't change it. Maybe somehow I tell this person something that makes them hurry in the future? Now what? There will be someone else at another store doing the same thing. I can't change this, so let's make the best of it and do some nose breathing meditations

3. If they're genuinely doing it on purpose as some narcissist behavior, getting angry means they won. These people are actually fun to mess with especially if they're doing coupons or doing 8 things and then pulling out their keys at the counter. If you ever end up behind one of them that has taken the lines hostage to pressure a cashier, do not budge. I like to be overly friendly assuring the cashier and the person in front it's no inconvenience for me to wait for a manager or whatever is necessary and then throw them off by asking them how their day is and being very jovial. It tends to really upset the irate customers if you don't join in their tantrum."
When taking a left at a busy intersection and I don't have a green arrow, I stay at the stop line. I don't want to get stuck in an intersection when it turns red, and I'm not going to run a red light just because I already moved into it when I couldn't go. You can also get through a shorter distance between cars if you have some room to speed up in. But half the time some asshole behind is honking at me because he thinks that 10ft of intersection space should be occupied
"The machine loudly announces PLEASE TAKE YOUR CHANGE and then someone starts moving in on you cause they're afraid they'll get swooped in on and have their spot taken. 

Fuck New Jersey."
I got inflammation in my uterus, abdomen, and appendix afterwards. Had to have surgery and now have a long vertical scar on my stomach. Do I take the cake?
No worse case is IUD needs replacement due to age and you chat with foreign doctor who you can‚Äôt fully understand and then she lady doctor confirms new coil all fitted - and you ask and old one ? - she says what old one ? - ffs - so painful having two in.
Nah. Worst case scenario is when you're measuring the uterus to ensure it's big enough to hold an IUD, but push too hard and perforate the uterus. Haven't personally done it, but have heard about it happening on more than one occasion.
Yeah I feel that. I was already there and I was like, let‚Äôs just do it now and get this shit over with.
I was actually in such pain after my IUD insertion that I jokingly told the doctor I couldnt give birth if I couldnt take this. She told me that I'd be fine because I'd be given an epidural :P
Got mine replaced last week...getting the old one taken out was definitely NOT more painful. It was more of a weird pulling feeling. Insertion is way worse, in my opinion.
"The procedure is very painful for many, though not everyone. As I said in another comment, it has still been worth it for me. They can last from 5 to 10 years depending on what kind you get. But if you prefer the pill, then go with that! Whatever works best for you.

Btw, dilation refers to opening up your cervix to place the device."
I mean it hurts when it gets inserted and then a few days of cramping...but not having to take a pill every day and always be refilling the prescription, plus having way fewer hormone fluctuations and (for me) not having the mood swings that come with the pill, is waaaaay better. I‚Äôll be sticking with IUDs for the rest of my fertile years!!!
I think the next best option would be the implant. Doesn't hurt at all apart from a little stinging when they inject the local anaesthetic. They don't last as long as an IUD, but 3-4 years is still pretty good and not having a period till the end of the 3rd year was a bonus.
Just tell them you want to be knocked out. And if they say no? Different doctor. They will do it. You have to push them. And hell, you deserve that... we all fucking deserve that.
"I mean, yes many women go through a lot, but they shouldn't have to and that care provider is part of the problem. Up in the comment chain there's a lady from Germany who said it's common practice to be put under for the same procedure, so idk, maybe we should be given better care instead of ""tutts""."
A few minutes of pain and a couple days of cramping, compared to years of not having to worry about birth control? Yeah, it's worth it to me.
Absolutely.  I can't speak for the women who get the hormonal IUD's... Personally the IUD would not be worth it for me in that case.  But I can't stand additional hormones and the copper IUD is the only option aside from condoms and the like, plus it's 5-10 years of no worry.   100% worth it, and I'm on my second one.  The previous one I had for 10 years, and this one I opted for the 5 year because hopefully babies.
My gf just got a new one. I told her that she shouldn‚Äôt feel like she needed to get it for my sake, we can just use condoms, cause she told me about how bad it hurt to put in. She laughed at me. Her regular period cramps are so bad, and the iud eliminates them completely. She‚Äôs miserable for a day or two to put it in, then no period for 5 years. Usually her period is debilitating for at least one day a month.
Unfortunately it wasn't for me, it got displaced after a month and that hurt even worse. After a month long period, not fun.
I loved my Mirena! I had it for 5 years. No problems, no babies and as a bonus, no periods! When we were ready to procreate, I had it removed, had one regular cycle and got pregnant. Easily one of the best decisions I ever made.
Mine was worth 10 years without hormones that could give me a blood clot and make me die. Totally worth it.
"I wouldn't call it ""nothing"".  I didn't enjoy having it removed, but it was much faster than having it inserted.  She just grabbed some forceps or similar device and pulled it out once my pap smear was done.  It was a deep cramping just like when you have it put in, and then it was over.  I bled quite a bit after though, which was interesting to me."
I had mirena inserted after I had my son 12 years ago. The insertion was much faster (18 hour labor), but the pain was much worse. It was even harder when I got it replaced with Liletta 5 years later. I'm pretty sure that doctor was a sadist. I was shaking and crying the whole time, even though I had taken a xanax. I'd still do it again though.
Honestly, by the time you‚Äôre pushing your kid out, you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even care how much this hurts, I have work to do.‚Äù I remember it hurt, and I was practically delirious but that pain is just a fuzzy memory, whereas I cringe remembering the IUD. I probably won‚Äôt have any more kids but I would in a heartbeat if the right guy came along; I‚Äôm not at all afraid of childbirth again. I am, however, afraid of another IUD insertion (which I‚Äôd also do again fir a copper IUD if I needed it, but it really scares me). It was seriously so breathtakingly painful.
My doctor told me last time(my third iud) that they get more painful the more you get. Yikes that last one may be my last.
"My doctor told me that it hurts so much because the cervix is made to push out something (a baby lol) and the IUD goes into it so your body is like what the heck?

To add my personal IUD story too lol I had to have my Kyleena IUD taken out, a Mirena IUD put in, and that same Mirena IUD taken out all within about 4 months.

Funny thing is when I got the Kyleena implanted it wasn‚Äôt terrible, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt fun and still hurt.

When I had to get that taken out 2 years later (it shifted out of place so it wasn‚Äôt effective anymore) I got the Mirena put in and omg did that hurt!!

I got light headed and I actually jumped (which my doctor told me could have caused a perforated uterus??)

When I asked my doctor why this time it hurt so bad she told me there was probably some scar tissue that made it hurt so much worse.

When I had to get the Mirena taken out (it got partially expelled when I was pulling out a tampon, and I didn‚Äôt even have it in long enough for my period to stop) I decided I was done with IUD‚Äôs lol cause the second time was so painful and I don‚Äôt think a third would be better.

Edit: Grammar"
"That hurts but I'm gonna one up you with my body pushed my IUD out one morning. 0/10 would not recommend.

Kidney stones was still worse tho."
It‚Äôs not. I had to stop the doctor inserting the iud because it hurt so much. Having a kid is completely different. Like if I HAD to choose right now if tomorrow id give birth or get an iud inserted id choose giving birth.
I have IC and endo so there's always some bullshit pain in there somewhere. Even still, having that thing placed was THE WORST fuckin' pain I've experienced. I'm normally quiet when there's expected pain (with vaccines or tattoos and crap like that). I was yelling and cursing so much, when I left the room the nurse was standing there with a basket of lollipops and a very sorry look on her face üòÖ
I didn't even feel my copper IUD go in, and the cramping was mild. Labor was much, much worse. Worth it, but worse.
"Seriously. 

I‚Äôve given birth, and had two IUDs. I think the IUD pain is more acute than labour cramps since the cervix is being dilated ‚Äúmanually,‚Äù which caused me to feel kind of dizzy and lightheaded, but the pain was pretty tolerable, just very uncomfortable. No meds... I practiced the same breathing techniques during the IUD insertion that I did while giving birth, so maybe that helped.

Edit: I forgot that I was advised to take an ibuprofen before the insertion, which probably helped a lot with the pain."
I usually don't remember the pain when I tell someone about how life changing the Mirena was for me. And mind you, I have very sensitive mucus membranes, so even inserting the speculum is rather painful. But a few hours of pain and discomfort is nothing compared to the two weeks every month that was mainly PMS, blood and different levels of pain. So I tell everyone that inserting can be rough, but it's definitely worth it. It's like paying a dollar to become a millionaire.
"I didn‚Äôt either.  It was 2 second pinch, got up, left, and I rode my bike home afterwards.

Not everyone has severe pain.. or anything close to it, for all those thinking about getting one.  The (slight?) pinch is worth it for years without a painful period!"
No, you're not alone. 2 IUD insertions, neither particularly painful. One of my friends told me she passed out during her insertion before I got mine, so I went in expecting the worst. I wonder if maybe as they get more common, more doctors are getting a better idea of what they're doing. When I got my first one 10 years ago something like 2% of American women had tried an IUD. In Europe they've been popular for decades and something like 40% of women have them- I lived overseas for a while and most women I talked to about this didn't remember getting one being all that painful.
I can't guarantee you a good experience, but I can tell you I've done it twice and had nothing like the experience some folks are describing. It was briefly uncomfortable, with a momentary flash of pain. But I really liked the copper IUD and will probably go back for a 3rd one when I'm done having kids.
You can try to request anesthesia, up in the thread commenters from Germany and Australia say it's common practice there.
"You know, I‚Äôve been bitching about the pain, but it doesn‚Äôt last forever. It hurt a lot, I blacked out, I came to, the pain was done but my BP was low. BP came back up, and I left, I got dizzy in the car, I got a gigantic Coke from McDonald‚Äôs, I sat in the car for 20 minutes till I felt normal again, and I went home and took some Advil. And I was fine. My college friend took me out for pizza that night and by that point the pain was 100% gone. Don‚Äôt let us all scare you out of it. I personally didn‚Äôt do well with the Mirena IUD but my side effects were apparently rare. 

As long as it‚Äôs what you want to do, the temporary pain will be worth it. It‚Äôs not like a tetanus shot (a necessary evil), where it aches like a bitch for a few days. It‚Äôs short-lived pain while your cervix is dilated and your uterus tries to adjust. Definitely better than the worry of an unplanned pregnancy."
It depends- my friend told me her horror story, so I expected the worst. But I've done it twice and felt nothing like that. It's also over super fast, and then you're set for 10 years.
I remember it was bad, but I don‚Äôt remember how the pain **felt**, if that makes sense. I remember the IUD pain more. Once birth was over I was achy but the acute pain and pressure were gone. The pressure was the worst if it, and it was instant relief when my son was delivered. And of course I had a lot more support from people while I was giving birth ... I didn‚Äôt exactly have a loved one holding my hand and cheering me on while I had that iud put in. üòÇ
Your experience might be totally different though. I‚Äôve seen other people saying theirs was fine. Go in relaxed (if possible) and breathe deeply through it.
I'm guessing if your obgyn had a nickel for every time they were farted on, they wouldn't need to work as an obgyn any more.
Holy shit. Reading this made me a little woozy. I feel your pain, and hope you never have to go through that again.
Whoa, what now? I‚Äôm due to get mine out soon, and I‚Äôve been worried that they downplayed the removal pain versus the insertion pain. :/
Yes I had mine replaced earlier this year and my doctor gave me a Valium. I had not a care in the world for the insertion. It still hurt, but I was like,‚Äùthis is fine, it‚Äôs almost over.‚Äù Which was completely different to my first one where I nearly broke the nurse‚Äôs hand and yelled,‚ÄùFUCK!‚Äù Several times.
Local may work for some of the pain. They could do a cervical block like they do for LEEP procedures. It wouldn‚Äôt stop the cramping afterwards, but could help in the meantime. But... having local anesthesia injected in to your cervix is very uncomfortable and may not be worth the double whammy!
"I‚Äôm sorry to hear you had to go through that!  I had a colposcopy and biopsy once with no idea what I was in for and it was terrifying!

I‚Äôm glad to hear you found an accommodating doctor.  I‚Äôll definitely try to find one that will sedate me next time I need a new IUD!"
"Yeah, I'm glad I have a new doctor, too. I actually had a panic attack during my last visit and she stopped what we were doing to talk me through it. And she actually listens to my concerns! It's great!

Also, issues of being a dumb teenager.

After an unfortunate, unplanned pregnancy and an even more unfortunate miscarriage, my mom believed the reasoning was that I wasn't using my birth control as frequently as I should have, when really there were just some issues with it. So my mom took control out of my hands and said I had to use a form of birth control where I wasn't the one doing it, because she felt I wouldn't do it right. So it was either an IUD or a nexplanon, and the very concept of nexplanon makes me wanna vom"
Yeah, she is very hardcore I guess... My guess is that she thought, if you can survive childbirth you can survive an IUD going in.
I am looking forward to not having to think about bc for a couple years... Can't take valium, unfortunately, but hopefully I can get the anesthetic.
Correction. An IUD is an **I**ntra**U**terine **D**evice. That bad boy goes straight past your cervix and all the way into your Uterus. If it's in your cervix, that's a problem (source: Mine slid out of my uterus and got lodged in my cervix. Had to be removed)
just a few more questions: 1. does that really only take 30 seconds? 2. does it not hurt all the time? 3. what is a liquid bandaid? never heard of that before. thanks for the explanation.
When I had mine inserted, I screamed in pain. Then I got horrible cramps for a while. Had it taken out after a year or so and it really didn't hurt. Removing it isn't painful in my experience.
I‚Äôm going to be very upfront with them and ask for some pharmaceutical help when the time comes. I‚Äôve seen people posting that they can do a local anesthetic there also. There is no way I‚Äôm getting through it otherwise!
"Ditto. When I got it put in it hurt like hell and I cramped for like a month. Getting it out, though, the tool they use to open ya up was the worst part! 

I can't really speak to how bad getting another one put in was tho since we're TTC atm. But getting it removed wasn't a big deal."
This is the one comment I‚Äôve read that‚Äôs not totally freaking me out as I‚Äôm thinking about getting one, so thanks!
So if I have vasovagal syncope I‚Äôm definitely going to pass out that‚Äôs good to know. I‚Äôve passed out from period cramps.
I‚Äôm going to avoid seeing her again for sure! I was booked in to have my implant removed and she did a pretty shoddy job of that too, compared to previous times with others doing it. I‚Äôve never felt the yank through a numbed area before.
Unfortunately the panic attack prevented me from having it removed. My doctor said she'd give me anti-anxiety meds for the next appointment.
Daughter fell (I saw through the window) cried for 1 second, stopped walked around the house to the door to find me and came in wailing like she was going to die.
Whenever it gets so bad you basically squeeze with the weight of Jupiter on your cheeks causing yourself to get a boner so you‚Äôre dashing across the house with horrible sweats and a full mast
"Once,  I'm stuck in a restaurant bathroom ( small restaurant,  and they only had one bathroom for everyone. I  am a survivor of anal cancer,  and I still often have a lot of pain with this,  though I doesn't really take any longer.  So, I'm in there,  and this person starts rattling the doorknob. I shout, ""I'm in here,  I'll be out in a minute."" Few seconds later,  rattle rattle,  I answered the same,  maybe a little louder. Next thing I know,  someone is UNLOCKING the door and starting to push it open.  I was glad I could reach it with my foot to hold it shut as I was screaming I SAID SOMEBODY IS FUCKING IN HERE AND I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.  Manager didn't apologize or anything. Fuck if I'm going there again."
"...should have jiggled the door handle whilst she was in there then asked if it helped XD

Edit: typing quickly whilst someone talking to me, made obvious English error. Am human, no need to be obnoxious. I don't reply rude things to others who make really obvious errors, its just not acceptable."
I had to yell at a lady banging on the restroom door at my restaurant once.  If you have to go that bad just used the one labeled mens, its single occupant anyway, we only labeled them due to stupid local code laws.
That's exactly how you end up with the person actually washing their hands properly counting as slow as possible or staring at their phone an extra few minutes to be vindictive.
"Journal, 4th of September 2020: I‚Äôm angered... I read a story that makes me slightly annoyed irritable due to relations with the Original Posters emotions. Then I suddenly realise how to time travel

Journal, 13th September 2020: I‚Äôm at the hospital. I‚Äôve suffered a seizure due to over exhaustion. My mom believes it‚Äôs because of the COVID-19 pandemic that has stressed me to the point of under sleeping. My father believes it‚Äôs due to overexposure to electronics and not exercising. They‚Äôre both wrong. I‚Äôve been researching Quantum Mechanics. So far my theory of time travel seems to have foundation.

Journal 27th of January 2021: I‚Äôve tried so hard and stretched myself thin. Many months ago I discovered the possibility of time travel, although I can‚Äôt write of it here. I have attempted blueprints of a prototype time machine, however such is not possible. The math is all wrong, I think... I think I lack the correct theorems and equations, such that are yet to be created by future scholars and professors.

Journal 16th July 2026: I‚Äôve met a Bioscience professor, they will be know here as The Anon. She‚Äôs part of a project called CRISPR, it is a gene editing tool in its early stages of testing and development. I think that if I undergo enough gene editing I can survive long enough for new mathematical material to properly orchestrate my work.

Journal 2nd May 2039: I should be 39 but I feel like a 20 year old. Gene editing truly has the potential to boost me into the future to finish my work. My peers have become suspicious of my apparent eternal youth. They ask me about such and I tell them with a smirk it‚Äôs my skin routine.

Journal 26th 2100: I faked my death two times, made it to the next century. Wasn‚Äôt comfortable. Bone and joint deterioration was unforeseen. Nothing body augmentation can‚Äôt fix. CRISPR has since become available to the general market. However, perpetual life genes are illegal. It‚Äôs become increasingly difficult to maintain my youth, however it‚Äôs beginning to pay off. Multiple theorems have since been invented to further project my work. I no longer need blueprints to build a time machine. The dimensions are implanted in my mind after many decades of waiting, dreaming and re-evaluation of the blueprints.

Journal 22nd 2135: I‚Äôve since got multiple PHDs in mathematical science. I‚Äôve grown inpatient, no longer can I simply wait for advancements. Authorities in most countries have restricted immortality in humans and such editing tools in smaller third world countries where those genes are legal, are too dangerous or vastly unequipped to sustain my life. I can‚Äôt blame the governments who enforce these laws. Overpopulation has become a steady problem due to such technological abuse. Abuse I‚Äôm willing to instil in order to succeed.

Journal 6th October 2147: I‚Äôve learned all I could, my mind is too clouded with these sciences. I‚Äôve also begun to notice a problem. In order calculate all equations I‚Äôve invented I must build a calculator that can do so. A computer, perhaps. This will be no problem. Only a few months more and I can proceed.

Journal 24th December 2148: I received a grand gift from the recesses of my mind... the machine. Finally it‚Äôs complete. Finally I can undo what has cursed me from the day I‚Äôve seen it. Going to unspecified date. 

Journal unspecified date: I try to act natural. I forgot how strange my clothes. Would look here. It doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôm here to do one thing. I arrive at the door. Shit. Women‚Äôs room. I‚Äôm a dude. Hell what can happen... besides, my entire life has led me here why stop now. I walk in there‚Äôs a middle aged female person. This person seems so flustered. Concerned. They need to use the bathroom and their afraid of doing it in her clothes. They don‚Äôt even notice me. I really empathise with this person.

Suddenly in a fit of rage they march over to a cubicle door and jiggling the door handle furiously.

‚ÄúYah, it‚Äôs occupied‚Äù a voice responds. The female person rolls they‚Äôre eyes and grits their teeth.

‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù she says to the person beyond the door ‚Äúthey need a reminder that people are waiting.‚Äù The person turns and sees me holding a revolver with a single bullet in the chamber.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs disrespectful‚Äù I say as I discharge. It rips through her cranium and rockets out the back of they‚Äôre skull in an explosion of cerebral confetti. The slumps over, jaw twitching. Eventually the twitching stops and I holster my weapon. It‚Äôs quiet until u/kn0wworries unlocks their cubicle door after a short while. They look at the corpse.

‚ÄúThanks! That person was extremely disrespectful‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me about it‚Äù I say ‚ÄúI spent my entire extended life time creating huge scientific breakthroughs just to kill that person!‚Äù"
"That's when you leave the survey on the toilet.

""Sorry, I didn't flush so that you could get in there quicker"""
honestly i kind of expect a knock if someone is waiting cause it is a bit embarrassing if you didn't know someone was waiting but jiggling the handle is a bit much
"Oh, when they start jiggling the door handle, I have one of two reactions. I either open the door and scream ""WHAT?"" or I shout ""the more you knock the longer I'm going to take."""
That‚Äôs when you use your hands to make a really loud sound that makes them think you have bad diarrhoea
Some people just like to be on their phones wasting valuable the when I really need to let this diarrhea out
I mean it was on the seat, on the commode, on the floor, on the wall behind the toilet. It was like the exorcist came out of his butt while he was pulling his pants down
Oh gosh, that sounds like a memorable nightmare! It's bad enough having digestion issues at home, let alone international travel
Washing machines are on a set timer, BUT they also try to redistribute the load for proper spin cycle, so it will spin, pause, spin pause, spin, etc. until it gets to within a tolerable distribution(or # of tries has passed) which it then adds more time, though sometimes does not alter the display.
"Yeah, and that ""Ad in 5... 4... 3..."" countdown that YouTube added a while back doesn't help much either.

If YouTube wants mid-roll ads, they should instruct the content creators to put actual fade-out / fade-back-in breaks in their videos for them.  A 30 second ad in a designed-in spot like that would be less obnoxious to me than a 5 second one that just ripped into the content mid-sentence."
I think it was an episode of Futurama, but there was some kind of emergency and they go ‚Äúif only we had 2 or 3 minutes to think of something!‚Äù and then it goes to commercials. I imagine that joke is lost on younger people who saw it for the first time on Netflix or Hulu with no ads though.
Yeah and you often took a break for the bathroom or something when it was time for TV commercials, while you are often watching youtube vidoes DURING your breaks
"I honestly would happily watch a minute of unskippable ads at the front-end of a 20 minute video if it meant that there wouldn't be any mid-roll ads.

I wish a plague upon the houses of whoever dreamed up mid-rolls and thought it was a good idea."
‚ÄúToday on YouTube video 4,745,123,943 we‚Äôre going to- RAID: shadow legends. Play today! -look at this hot new drama of YouTube star yo- The soap you use, it‚Äôs shit! You‚Äôre not a dish! -utube star that did a bad thing‚Äù
I love how some of the shows try to make the ads go at the end of a sentence or during a transition, but YouTube fucks it up and starts it just a second or two too early
"I've been watching Taskmaster on youtube. Airs on television so the show is set up for breaks. ""We'll be right back"" ""We're back. Our next challenge is"" *Youtube ad*"
Gets weird sometimes when the shows air in countries with fewer ad breaks. They cut in the middle instead of the natural breaking point.
I can‚Äôt stand when they do it in middle of something. Guy will be explaining something and then it goes to an ad. Usually I lose interest in the video when that happens. Like why don‚Äôt they just let creators pick where an ad goes. I‚Äôd rather have it like that
30 seconds on a 10 minute video feels way worse than 5 sets of 2 minute ads on a 30 minute show. I think you're right that TV shows were designed with ads in mind, but YouTube videos aren't.
Huh, that's smart. I actually never thought of why they felt so jarring, but that actually makes a lot of sense. They are just kinda' thrown in there compared to TV.
I was living with my older brother a year back and he insisted on paying the extra $80/month on top of the internet to have basic cable and I was like okay, whatever. I tried watching something once and the ads made me nope the fuck out. The programming is like one fourth ads - dangerously rearing on a third. He told me he liked the ads. I guess maybe he felt lonely and the ads made him feel some sense of belonging? Idk. But in today‚Äôs model if you pay for a service you‚Äôd think it would be ad-free. Cable still manages to exist via old people alone.
Lately YouTube started not serving the actual video until the length of the ad runs out, so it just shows an error message for me in while the advert would last (Opera)
"I don't remember what show it was (maybe Seinfeld?), but I watched an *official* version of something from the 90's where everybody sounded like fucking chipmunks because they chose to speed the whole thing up instead of making cuts.

By ""official"" I mean I was watching it on an actual TV channel, not like one of those things where it's altered to fool robots looking for content where it shouldn't be available."
You can install ublock origin on the mobile version of the Firefox browser. I assume there's a similar story for Chrome. Youtube Vanced is a bit of a process to install, but it works well as a stand alone youtube app with built in adblock.
Don't know if you run Android or not, but if you do, you can DL Firefox and equip it with Ublock just like you would on a computer. If you run iOS you're shit outta luck though.
No no, you *definitely* need an IT hooker, unless you have a self-taught one. And yes, they're more common than you think.
Well if it's an IT hooker, it'll help you set it up. If it's a regular hooker, it'll help you ignore the few ads that do slip through.
"On the plus side it means that more of the internet stays free for all of us. But it's a ""rules for thee but not for me"" situation, because there is no way I'm allowing ads in my browser."
"Dude, am not the killer, I was just eating oatmeal

Edit: WHY THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE ASSUMING AM A CEREAL KILLER?

Cereal killer is my cousin, NOT me"
Any time you‚Äôre on the outside of the door, you‚Äôre on the same side as every killer ever. Except for any killers who happen to be on the inside.
"This is real though. I used a public bathroom in the grocery store once (actually I've used it more than once but this story is about this one time..) and as I'm washing my hands I can hear a commotion outside. Then yelling  swearing and banging on the bathroom door. At first I'm just like shit someone's rlly gotta go! But no. They start yelling about how they're going to  fucking kill me and how ""I"" better stop hiding and get the fuck out there and how they're gnna fuck me up. Banging and trying to open the door.  I then had to decide whether to piss em off more by staying in there longer or exiting to god knows what.  No freaking clue who this person was looking for but it 100% was not me. And yes i came out."
Then that means you're locked outside the bathroom with a killer because they lock from the inside... In which case why would you be trying to get into the bathroom?
"And the guy on the toilet is thinking ""oh shit, I can't leave until every one else is out of the room"""
Or if you took the handicap stall, because the other one was full when you came in. And now you see a wheel chair on the outside.
"Weirdly enough, I don't have that bad of a gag reflex normally. Like, it's nothing to write home about, but I'm not one of those ""gags while brushing their teeth"" types either. I'm pretty solidly average.   


Whatever that goop was, though, just set me off. I couldn't do it. I almost immediately started choking until I was full-on crying. It took several tries to get me all the way through it. I'm gagging a little bit just remembering it- and it's been at least 15 years since I last had it done. The terrible taste/smell/gritty texture of that putty will haunt my nightmares until my dying day."
"Had this happen to me. I warned them I have a mega sensitive gag reflex and they are going to get like one shot at this  


first one isnt good enough  
 \*sigh\* Ill do it again.  
second one isnt good enough.  
....  
Third one isnt good enough  
They wanted me to go for a fourth, I straight up told them no. We had been doing that shit for 15 minutes, my stomach HURT from the dry wretching. I was so glad I didn't eat breakfast in preparation.   


Now with Invisalign, they had this cool rod that they moved around your teeth and it makes a 3D model on a computer it was so much easier"
Do those horrible hard things they put in your cheeks at the dentist to take x-rays murder you too? I can‚Äôt handle those things.
I remember I had to be put under laughing gas in order for the mould to be done after a previous attempt went horribly.
Pro-tip: wrap your fingers around your thumb (like you're making a fist, but with your thumb on the inside rather than the outside) and apply some pressure to suppress your gag reflex. Not sure why it works, but it does.
What‚Äôs wrong with Helvetica?? My graphics arts teacher in HS was obsessed with it and told us that‚Äôs the best and cleanest font lol
Hahaha my people! They had to take impressions before I got my braces off as well. So the trays that hold the goop were larger. And I have a horrible gag reflex, which everyone in the office knew by that point. The poor woman, she said (more or less), ‚Äú I know how this is going to go. Once we get this in there, we are getting the impression come hell or high water.‚Äù I threw up. While she was holding the tray in. Just kept puking while she kept holding. It was horrible. She was a saint.
"Yeah and then you have to do it more, which makes you want to gag more, and it‚Äôs this never ending cycle of gag and repeat.

I‚Äôm so glad they‚Äôre off"
Try this: put your thumb between your index and middle finger and squeeze hard.  It seems to suppress gagging in most people.
"Oh my fucking god I've never been so humiliated.

I was gagging, dry heaving, tearing up, and uncontrollable  saliva was just POURING from my mouth, running down my chin and onto my shirt.

They patted my hand, kept asking if I was okay, and what the fuck can you even do besides make Frankenstein noises with that thing in your mouth? 

Finally they took it out. They let me rinse my mouth, clean up, breathe a bit and regain composure.

""Okay, ready for the other one?"" 

Fuck. My. Life."
"They said the same to me! And it didn't work because I guess my tongue pushed it out of place or something while I was gagging? 

So they took it out and sighed and said they'd have to start over like it was MY FAULT for fucking it up and I was being uncooperative?"
Depends if they over loaded the little tray with goop to where it slowly starts drooping down your throat. Especially if you have a small mouth
"My brother and I had an appointment at the same time so they did ours together. While the assistant was trying to pat my hand and calm me down as I gagged and choked, she told me to see how easily my brother was doing it.

I managed to flail my head in his direction and saw him laying there with both top and bottom trays in his mouth, perfectly calm. When I looked at him he lifted up his hands in a shrug. 

Ok lady, I'll just tell my gag reflex to be more like his?? It doesn't make it any easier for me to know that he is better at having teeth goop in his mouth."
My ortho was an absolute pro and managed to get the mold done despite me throwing up all over myself. Probably seen it enough times.
You just reminded me that I still have a permanent metal retainer on my bottom teeth from 14 years ago
I didn't take them srsly when they said rest of your life. It stopped fitting in my mouth by 6 months later. 20 yrs ago
Same thing. When I had to get the mold done for the retainer years later after getting the braces off the assistants brought up how I threw up last time. Luckily I didn‚Äôt the second time.
"So, technically there's supposed to be wax to cover said sharp edges, but it kinda sucks and gets in the way. And doesn't really work well. 

Source: am dental student"
I don't have bracers but I do have a retainer for bruxing and when she removed the metal thing it felt as if all my fillings were going to come out with it
It was definitely metal when I did it. It has been almost 20 years now so maybe they‚Äôve advanced but it was BRUTAL with the metal tray. I am gagging thinking about it.
Oh trust me I know :( I got my first retainer after I had jaw surgery and after 4 years I barely wore it, and it would hurt SO bad each time I would try to actually wear it... I would wear for awhile then just stop. I was dumb. Eventually I lost it a few months ago and that‚Äôs why I had to go in this morning and get another impression and order a new one. Thankfully they said my teeth didn‚Äôt move that much. $500 and it‚Äôs going to hurt when I wear it again :( so yeah, I wont do that again... we both learned our lesson.
"Prime Scan made by Dentsply Sirona is what you may be referring to. So much of dentistry is going digital now. Better for the patient, better impressions for the dentist, and less waste! 
Win, win, win!"
Biting down into the alginate. The smack of the suction breaking as they pulled the tray out.  Loved it. As long as they made it bubble gum or grape flavored, they were welcome to take as many impressions as they wanted.  I still have a plaster cast of my age 12 teeth somewhere in this house. I don't think I could do it now, my gag reflex is much more responsive these days after having had some stomach issues.
"I must have been a huge hit at the orthodontist that day because every single employee gave me a pity smile on my way out. I had made a god damn  scene with all my gagging and drooling and crying. 

So the next week when I came in again for whatever, the assistant who led me to the chair said ""So... Unfortunately the impressions we took last time didn't come out right... We're gonna have to do them again..."" And she had the most apologetic look on her face.

I just stood there, my heart dropped, and I squeaked out ""ok."" 

Then she said ""HA I'M JUST KIDDING!"" and *everyone* in the office burst out laughing. 

I laughed too, and she apologized for making fun but just couldn't pass up the opportunity. I wasn't mad!"
That sucks. For me it felt like the air threw my nose wasn't going to my lungs properly and I was choking.
That makes sense. I did have a full x ray done and I‚Äôm going to assume they didn‚Äôt make me go through all that since I‚Äôm an adult. I do hate these stupid build ups though. I just want to chew normally!
I feel you there. I still feel like I'm not *supposed* to exist, even though I'm not suicidal anymore.
Word. Closest I ever came to going through with it was about 2.5 years ago and the next morning, even for other reasons, just felt very..wrong.

Glad you stuck around, bro."
Maybe so many of you in the multiverse stopped living there that all the you‚Äôs that survived feel the strange disturbance
Goodness, that sounds really rough. I really hope you're doing better now. Take care of yourself! Sending you internet hugs!
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING YOU SAID ABOUT ‚ÄúDoing things you say you‚Äôll never do again that really stick with you‚Äù ....for me they‚Äôre destroying me.. I don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm existing anymore nor do I want to b/c I continue to repeat what I know better not to do. Insanely cannot stand myself anymore!
Or waking up the next morning questioning wether you still exist, cause you're unsure of how things played out. Maybe it's just me I've tried suicide via drugs & alcohol many many times and for some reason it never worked. I would trick myself into thinking maybe it did work and this is just purgatory or something of the sort, due to the numbness of what I just attempted to do to myself, and the fact that I was still probably very high on the drugs/still drunk. To this day I still get caught up on the shit I survived and just questioned if that was really the case.
God I feel that. I can't for the life of me understand how people are able to frame it as 'having survived' I mean I'm glad they can see it that way, but for me, it's just... Another day, and I'm still here, but I never know why or... How-what to make of it.
I remember the day after the worst night of my life. All that pain and all that closeness to the edge and then, going to school like normal the next day. A stranger said ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù as a formality in passing and I said ‚Äúgood‚Äù, thinking about how ironic it was to say that, when it was the lowest point of my life. But no one would ever know. And life simply went on after that. And it didn‚Äôt wait for me to get better.
Not at all to discount your experience, but I‚Äôve felt that smallness while under the influence of hallucinogens, but instead of desolation, I felt immense relief and joy. Ego death isn‚Äôt pleasant, but understanding my insignificance seemed to make me connected to all things.
Thank you, it was recent and truth be told I'm struggling to stay afloat at times, but I'm trying. I'm glad you're here too :)
"I'm sorry that you went through that experience, but am also glad that you did what you needed to in order to survive. I listened to 21 Pilots songs on repeat all night, refusing to sleep until I saw daylight. Up to that point, I was looking to create a playlist of my final songs to listen to before I would then pop the rest of my pills... ""Addict With A Pen"" give that song a listen, bro.

What about the many people who unfortunately take their lives and don't receive a phone call at the last moment?"
I appreciate the comment but I‚Äôm completely alone at this point. I‚Äôm utterly lost, I don‚Äôt want to move, I just want everything to be over. I want this pain to go away.
"I enjoy occasionally test replying to the politics subreddit just to get the ""oops! Something went wrong!"" message. 

I may or may not have suggested a general hope for, when a certain person finally does kick the bucket, that they do so in an incredibly embarrassing way. This is *not* the same thing as inciting violence and does not violate any free speech rules, but the mods on that subreddit are probably fairly busy."
Let's just say I've grown up since then, but you can also send people messages to their phone through your email.
"Good, y'all sound needy AF

I'll reply when I get around to it

If you needed an immediate answer you should have called"
Then that person read your message in their notifications and didn't bother reading it again in the messaging app to try answering it.
"No, I don't know if you use apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, but in those apps you can turn on in the settings that the sender of a message sees that you read it. So as a sender I can be sure that the person read my message so it makes me wonder why I didn't get an answer. 

Unread is even worse, it means that someone likely saw your message in the notifications and didn't bother reading it again to try and answer it."
If it's someone important to me who leaves me on read, I wait a couple of days and either apologize for causing confusion or anything bad by my text, or I'll write regarding a different topic.
"Shit dude. I met a cool girl. She was a good friend. Told her I liked her and it didn't go well. She cut me out of her life and hasn't interacted with me in nearly a year

"Not just liking someone but this is true of a lot of things. I denied a truth that I knew about a relationship that I was in for a long time. It wasn't until I vocalized it to someone that it became ""true"" after which I was able to start making steps towards getting what I wanted. It was a difficult road but I am so so so so much beyond happier now in my life"
"Yeah, tell me about it. Brains are weird and deeply, annoyingly irrational sometimes. Speaking as someone who has anxiety issues, time management difficulties, and a perfectionist streak a mile wide, I must admit that I'm the kind of person who tends to take forever to respond to messages and produce the whole ""left on read"" thing, not intentionally, but because I want to get it exactly right. Of course, this sometimes goes into seriously shitty territory because the longer I take to respond to someone, the worse I feel about it and the more that I think (irrationally but uncontrollably) that I need to get everything \*completely perfect\* so they'll forgive me for taking so long, which makes me take longer to respond and therefore feel worse about it, and thus I take longer to respond...You can probably see where this is going. I call them ""anxiety spirals"", and they suck."
"Amen. I just got my heart broken into a million pieces. Now I wish I never said anything.

"What a strange r/usernamechecksout

""I can't decide if I just think he's cute and I like the attention, or if I really like him. My feelings just keep moving back and forth!""

But I entirely agree, personally would much rather the girl tell me that as opposed to ""I thought you'd think badly of me for saying I like you back"", that statement just sounds like a red flag, makes it sound like she feels like everyone she gets attached to runs away, or potentially she pushesthem away when emotionally distraught - i.e. has an attachment disorder or borderline or something

Nothing wrong with people that suffer from that, or dating them, but at the very beginning of a relationship when you're not very attached to the girl(or guy, etc.) I might consider walking away depending on where I'm at emotionally and if I'm ready to handle the unique nature of that kind of relationship"
Kind of doubting she was, considering that it was during covid we met and it was just us 2 spending the entire day together until we slept. Thinking back, Idk why I doubted her liking me.
Putting some words into my mouth, eh? I was responding to the comment, not the question as my situation was kinda fitting since it was a risky text with a bunch of writing and stopping
This is pretty much my life currently. I haven't had an honest-to-God crush in *years*, and now I'm acting like I'm in high school again. Like, we'll text/send video messages back and forth for a solid hour, then... nothing. I'll work up the courage to say something else to continue the conversation, but I don't want to be annoying--which is a shitty intrusive thought to have. And then a couple days later, he'll pick up where I left off and we're good. It seems like we both have a tendency to withdraw from time to time, so I try not to get too in my head about it.
"And you keep telling yourself ‚Äúi dont really care about the response‚Äù

But jump to your phone at every buzz or sound, assuming its a response from them...."
"Plus the continual wondering if they have any awareness at all that them responding or not is having an effect on you at all or if they just glanced at their phone thought ""oh I'll look at it later"" or what...."
I‚Äôm not sure what that means? By bears I mean females and I‚Äôll never stop females are my life line and as far as the male friends go? It hasn‚Äôt been all of them just most of them. Envy is a bitch it‚Äôs fucked me my whole life, I try to be nice and men just envy the shjt out of me. It‚Äôs whatever it‚Äôs been like that my whole life. Envy is a sin and the center of this whole thing for a reasons
That‚Äôs awful, I‚Äôm sorry she did that to you. I hope you were able to establish boundaries/cut her out. Anxiety attacks fucking suck.
"A few years ago, basically all of my friends were going through some shit and since I am the most levelheaded, they all ended up talking to me about their problems.

That's ok, I don't mind and I liked feeling like I mattered (which was my own issue at the time). But the recurring theme was that whenever 'a talk' would come up, they would start their conversation with ""hey"".

Not ""hey man"" or ""hey what's up"" or ""hey what are you up to?"". Singular ""hey"" meant ""I've got problems and need to talk about them"", 100% of the time.

So now when anyone else messages me with just ""hey"" I immediately get concerned for their wellbeing and get ready for a tough talk, even though usually it's just a greeting nowadays."
‚ÄúThere was something else but I will tell you in the morning.  Don‚Äôt want to ruin your nights sleep worrying‚Äù.   Had that one before.
Man I haven't had a fight with someone I was just friends with legit since like elementary school. If we get along that badly I'm just not considering them a friend anymore.
An ex girlfriend of mine did that, but it was about 3 days before we could see each other. Can you imagine the fucking torture of this kind of stress for three days straight? That was a shit move from her...
">  I don't want you to be anxious

Holy balls your best friend is shockingly oblivious, that is an absolute recipe for causing anxiety."
I know, I felt so bad. He was going through a stressful time and I think he thought it was about to get worse.
Oh me too, I would have reacted the same way. Just wasn't thinking I guess. I apologized right away and have been much more careful since.
"Maybe just clarify that its nothing bad? Like ""can we call just to chat/catch up?"" Or ""can i call you, I hate texting lol"" something like that is usually what I would say"
I live on the other side of the world from my mom and when she sends the ‚Äúare you up?‚Äù Or ‚Äúcan you talk now? I need to talk to you.‚Äù messages I always get anxious.... until she goes, ‚Äúyou haven‚Äôt called in a while!‚Äù
One of my buddies in high school did that. Found out his girlfriend had banged another dude, so he picked her up and drove to Sonic, dumped her and left her there.
My parents used to do this all the time when we were kids. Whether it was something they wanted us to lecture us about or just an awkward obligatory parent-kid talk they would make sure we were somewhere we couldn‚Äôt just get up and walk out.
It was more like we met at a park to go for a walk, she broke up with me, then she literally ran away to go on a jog while I walked away awkwardly
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great I also have one additional thing I wasn‚Äôt thinking about until you mentioned your thing‚Äù
Reddit loves to complain about other sites taking their content and reddit is made up entirely of content from other sites
"""We need to talk, call me.""

*calls*

""So there's a problem here. And the problem is that I made coffee but we're out of cream, can you pick some up on the way home?"""
"My estranged wife would often send a text of ""call me."" No reason or level of urgency. I even told her I wanted a reason. I stopped responding unless there was a reason. She elevated to threats. I blocked her. I'm much less anxious now."
"Or when you miss a call by just a tiny bit, so you immediately call them back... and they don't answer. What sort of event could have transpired in the two seconds between your call and my call?  

""Oh he's not answering, guess I'll just chuck this phone off a cliff"""
My sister and I have had 2 immediate family members die in the past two years.  We agreed to NEVER send texts like that.
I have a friend of mine who does this all the time. And usually it'll be about something unimportant like fantasy baseball or a TV show he just watched. The last time I told him he was like the boy who cried wolf. One of these days he's going to be stuck on the side of the road and I'm going to ignore his text because I don't need to talk about baseball right now.
"Tell her not to do it anymore and just say ""call me"" or wait until you are together in person.  She may not be aware of what she is doing it is good to find that out before jumping to a conclusion.  If she reacts negatively then you should worry."
Ahm maybe. The one time I‚Äôve used the ‚Äúwe need to talk‚Äù line was when I was drunk off my ass in a different neighborhood and needed him to walk me home. But also I was internally freaking out because he had done something the night before that triggered a flashback and I had to somehow tell this guy I had only dated for a month about the one thing I don‚Äôt want to remember. So if it‚Äôs ‚Äúwe need to talk‚Äù and then ‚Äúnevermind‚Äù she might be trying to tell you something that‚Äôs really hard to talk about
"Man I so get this. But then I start overthinking like ""ok but then what will they say if then ever DO need to fire or yell at me..."""
"My boss does a similar thing with me. Sometimes she would schedule a meeting with me on my calendar with no context and without speaking to me about it, and the meeting name would just be ‚ÄúMeet with (her name).‚Äù

After I messaged her 2-3 separate times asking if I was in trouble, she started following up with ‚Äúit‚Äôs nothing bad‚Äù or putting gifs in the email invites before she sent them to me lol. Definitely dropped my anxiety levels at work by a LOT"
"Doesn't even make my mind race. I am not intrigued, it doesn't make me want to rush to find out what the hell it is, or make me panic if things are 'OK' or not. 
If it's important, text it, or phone and tell me about it, just say the thing!"
"And my axe. 

Man, empathy, people!! Think about how things seem without any context! Meetings and texts and voicemails alike. Sheesh. /rant"

"I was definitely guilty of using too much toothpaste up until a few years ago. And I blame those Aquafresh commercials that showed some happy ass prick squeezing a fat line of that colorful shit the entire length of the toothbrush with the perfect swoop at the end. I'd always try to replicate it as a kid, only managed to do it once or twice though and I thought it was fucking amazing.

I've since learned that a pea sized amount does the job adequately, which is great because I have to pay for my own goddamn toothpaste now."

I'm an anesthesiologist and I start every phone conversation with 'your loved one is fine' (as long as they're actually doing well). I got some feedback a few years back that during the few sentences where I introduce myself, families agonize about the fate of their loved one.

Most of the littles like it. I'm not sure when they stop liking it but my son (5) loves it and he loves watching other people being sung to and them blowing out their candles.  I think when you're a teen it becomes embarrassing.

"Honestly, I would rather that. 

As a teenager at Camp one year, they must have been donated like a metric ton of Cheddar Cheese because they would have it cut up with every meal, cubes of cheese just constantly. 

Anyway I didn‚Äôt know then what I know now, as it pertains to cheese and your ability to have a normal poop. So after days and days of eating almost nothing but cheese cubes, I developed an opiate-addict level of constipation. Like, severe abdominal distress, barely able to function, sit on the toilet for an hour and cry, constipation. 

Finally I summon the courage to ask the Camp Caretaker: ‚Äúcan you please buy me some laxative from town? I am horribly constipated‚Äù. Thank God, that afternoon, with exlax in hand, I boldly face the rest of the day. 

That was, until evening time came. By the time evening chapel was a go at 7pm, the miracle of modern medicine turned my body into a violent, bathroom-clearing, toilet-clogging giant turd machine. 

Imagine the irony of having to track down the same Camp Caretaker to now ask him for a plunger. ‚ÄúI guess those laxatives worked,‚Äù he said with a wink. You have no idea buddy. I now know what it‚Äôs like to be in prison, except I was the one hurting my own anus. 

In the end, it was a stick from the woods that saved my pride and smooshed that coke-can-sized log down that poor underpowered toilet. 

I only wish Reddit had existed back then, for perhaps I would have heard tale of a poop knife, which might have shielded my honour. 

And that‚Äôs the true story of how I destroyed my ass, a toilet, and my dignity, all in the span of one night."
"I get that sometimes, where I have to pee like nothing else, but when I finally try to go it comes out super slow and takes for-fucking-ever, and I still have the ""bladder hurts from being at 110%"" feeling the whole time"
"Ugh that reminds me of the year I had a sore throat at camp. My school took us to a mini ‚Äúsummer camp‚Äù for a week every October from 4th to 6th grade. In 5th grade I had a sore throat from hell and ran out of cough drops so I kept guzzling water to alleviate it. I experienced that ‚Äúin physical pain‚Äù level of having to pee for the first time in my life. 

And I‚Äôm a girl so like. Peeing in the woods is a very involved process and I wasn‚Äôt good at it at age 10 so I just suffered and hobbled through the hike painfully until we got back to the camp and I could go in a toilet. This happened 3 different times because I was 10 and an idiot and couldn‚Äôt figure out that I should cool it with the water. Yeah that wasn‚Äôt a great year at camp lol."
"> somehow it made it so much more difficult to pee but still hurt the same

I've had that happen a couple times before, if I understand what you mean. Like you've held it so long that it feels like there's no room left in your bladder but the only way to get it to start is by forcing it out?

It's a super bizarre sensation and I will do anything to avoid going through it again. It does eventually start going on its own after a couple seconds in my experience, but it *cannot* be good for you."
I went to young life camp one summer and I really had to pee during the last night testimonials thing-like our bags were on the bus already and we were leaving straight from there. I went to get up because I REALLY had to go and one of the counselors was like ‚Äúno that‚Äôs really disrespectful this is the most important part of the week‚Äù...I sat there until I knew I was going to pee my pants and I got up and ran outside. A different kinder counselor saw what was up, followed me, and we ran to the bus so I could change before everyone else got there. I just said I had gotten my period (except I told my bff that I actually peed my pants). Later the other counselor didn‚Äôt apologize but instead was like ‚Äúif it was that bad you should have gone!‚Äù I TRIED you crazy lady
even after going pee on the side of the road I still had to go again when the bus stopped at the rest stop.
because it was breakfast when I drank the 2L to see how fast I could drink it all (the funny thing is that most of the camp cheered me on well I drank the water.) and I thought I would be pee it all out before I got on the bus.
"Oh my god, I am so sorry for laughing and so sorry this happened to you, worst nightmare right here!

If it makes you feel any better, Jack Black was attacked by the brown goblin in the middle of filming Nacho Libre - they were in a field and there was nowhere to go, so he had to run away and squat in the grass, and the crew was still around and everything!"
Exactly, if the urge to shit hits me right as I lay down in my bed I can still sleep, and wait until a couple hours after waking up, no problem. Trying that if the urge to piss hits me would be a bad idea...
Hard agree. I never feel at risk of actually shitting myself, no matter how much I have to go. But I've had situations where I really considered the possibility that I may just have to pee right on the floor in about 30 seconds if I don't get to a bathroom.

"Drum corps memories are the best memories. I'm glad I helped you remember that :)

Maybe u/I_Hate_Strawberries had just told her she was giving up her lifelong calling of running an orphanage to pursue a career in high fashion modeling.

The first time it happened to me I was at work alone and didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with me, weird thing was I was fully capable of working and talking to customers normally but inside I felt like I wasn‚Äôt even there and in a dream or something.
I always want to not be alive after a panic attack.  Not in a rush suicidal way, it's that I'm so disassociated that I can't comprehend the point of life and I just don't want to exist or to have ever existed.  Not just myself, like I don't see the point of the existence of anything.  It's the strangest feeling, and physical touch is the only thing that makes me start understanding life and existence again.  Getting my SO to understand what was happening was so difficult, how do you explain that to someone who has never experienced it?
I tried to illustrate exactly this in a [50-second short film I made last year.](https://youtu.be/ahk0LIKYh8Y)
Yeah for me it feels like I've just ran a marathon and don't have the energy to stay panicky. Which really makes me think I need to workout more.
"My first legit panic attack was very similar. Caught me completely off guard. I still went to work that day, but I'm glad I leave early for everything cuz once it hit me i couldn't move nor do anything other than hyperventilate and probably look like a crazy person retching in my parking lot. I remember thinking 'how can I possibly call off for this but how tf am I supposed to drive when even looking at my vehicle makes me  unbelievably sick.' That was the worst drive of my life. The whole way to work ~10 mins just saying over and over OUT LOUD ""just focus on the road, this could be the last drive you ever take if you get distracted"" and by the time I got to work I was so out of it. The panic was gone but the disassociation was SO strong. I believed I was in a game, like nothing mattered cuz whatever choices I made would result in either everything being fine or my death,  and I just didnt care cuz it didnt feel like MY body anymore."
Measure 109 in Oregon is a measure that would allow psilocybin theropy treatment. I'm really hoping it'll pass, because I've heard it can help with anxiety
"The difference between a psychedelic ego death and a panic attack induced disassociation is like night and day.  I don't think they are at all comparable.

Having experience with both I can say that one is calm and relaxing, maybe even eurphoric, while the other is probably one of the most awful feelings in the world.  Seriously, I wouldn't wish disassociation on my worst enemies."
I have not but I've been told to try them. Unfortunately not legal here but maybe if I ever make it to the west coast I can try some. Very curious
I feel that. I have low blood sugar, so I deal with the crashes. I also deal with panic attacks....and to add on a medication I take for epilepsy, when it drops, it all feels the same. So I stand there debating what are the odds of each of the three.
Wow I didnt even think about this! I am a type 1 diabetic and when I go really low there is that panicky feeling. They are very similar feelings
"I see a post every now and then on fb describing ""grounding"" where when you are disassociated you find 5 things to touch 4 things to hear etc for all the senses. Havent been able to try it yet but it seems like a solid solution"
"Go to your primary care doctor. Tell them that you ""may"" have had a heart attack but you think it was a panic attack. They'll hook you up to an EKG and show you that you did not have a heart attack. Knowing that will help with future episodes. 

At least it did with me. Had an attack almost identical to what you described. Fortunately for me I wasn't driving at the time. Went to the doc, they hooked me up and said my ticker was alright. That alone helped me out tremendously."
I had my first one last year while at the cinema. The following months were horrible where I frequently got them while trying to sleep. Went to a therapist which helped and now I haven‚Äôt had any problems for quite a while. I think it was very much stress related.
Holy Toledo...... this is almost exactly me. Had my first panic attack about 2 months ago, at the ripe old age of 34. I‚Äôm pretty healthy, run regularly and such but in that moment I thought I was going to die. Longest few minutes of my life waiting for the ambulance. My wife has had anxiety her whole life, so she was pretty sure it was a panic attack but the hyperventilating made my hands and face basically seize up, so she started to worry it was more serious. Two months later and I still have anxiety related chest/breathing restrictions where it feels like my chest is constricted.
Yep, same feeling I get with mine. I was convinced I was having a heart attack the first time it happened. My wife called 911, I was laying on the floor, wife was crying and hugging me thinking this would be the last time she saw me alive. My 3-year old son was standing there on the stairs, asking if he could have some milk.
Literally had this happen. It‚Äôs been a stressful month and after an argument me and my girl had about the situation I felt my chest seizing up. Sat there for 5 min unsure whether it was a heart attack or not and said screw it call 911 after I got light headed followed by body numbness. Could barely stand or breathe. Fire department showed up and said well you look extremely healthy and you‚Äôre pretty young, that it was probably a panic attack. Called off of work the next day it scared me so bad, who he‚Äôd sucked cause working construction I got all kinds of shit for having that as my excuse.
I‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs just not to fight them or fear them. I just kinda ride the wave...a very uncomfortable wave, but it does go away. It‚Äôs hard not to fear them, but knowing that they won‚Äôt kill you helps.
Mine can last from 30 seconds to maybe a minute or two, cause i learned to control them (on rare occasions though they can last longer than that). But they can come in short intervalls. When it was the worst, i could have like 20-30 panic attacks during a normal day. I mean the high frequency forced me to learn how to deal with them. They definitely lasted way longer when i started to get them.
My first panic attack happened out of nowhere, and it was a really bad one, I think it happened because I had an energy drink when I really didn‚Äôt need one and I think I started freaking out because of it (I was raised with a energy drink = really bad mentality from my mom) I just started shivering really badly and I couldn‚Äôt stop, I was so fucking scared. I‚Äôve only gotten that kind of panic attack a few times, normally it‚Äôs like what you described, the last time it happened I was going to get a haircut and I couldn‚Äôt get out of the car, I turned around, went home, and just couldn‚Äôt stop crying and panicking, and that is mostly due to my anxiety, which I was just diagnosed with, so I don‚Äôt know a lot of coping strategies for them. And yea college is stressing me out a lot too, I just started college and I‚Äôm working my first job, and it‚Äôs super stressful, in the first week I already had a smaller panic attack because of 1 of my classes.
Exactly! My body tells me i am in immediate danger and fear for my life like I‚Äôm getting shot at in Vietnam but I‚Äôm really just driving my car to Wendy‚Äôs....
Thank you for that description. I've been struggling for years to explain what it's like, but that's perfect.
Damn that's accurate. I tried to explain it like, it's like I'm watching a car speeding towards one of my children... but I'm just sitting on the couch watching South Park and completely losing my shit. Luckily this isnt something I face often, but I had a whole series of them this summer.
Every single time this has happened to me o always envision inventing a poop grabber that can reach into your ass and grab the poop from the back and pull it out. Could you imagine how that would feel? Poop being pulled from you ass?
Lol this happened to my puppy yesterday he was freaking the fuck out, poor boi kept looking back there like ‚Äúwhat the hell? Drop!‚Äù
Now, I feel like there's an entire world of personal issues out there that I know nothing about. Why do y'all have such complicated shitting procedures?
I figured out stretching really far to the left then really far to the right (while pushing) helps win the battle.
Eloquently put. Indeed, a struggle that mankind has faced throughout the ages, be it Julius Caesar, Napoleon, or some anonymous 9th century Anglo-Saxon baker. Poop struggle is real.
I keep tongs hanging next to my toilet so when I have a nearly petrified solid turd that‚Äôs throwing a fit not to come out, I use the tongs to grab that sucker and yank him out. Can‚Äôt squeeze too hard or you‚Äôll slice it and make it harder for yourself.
This is why it‚Äôs so hard to lose weight. Most people don‚Äôt realize how much effort it takes to burn calories compared to how many calories are in even the smallest snack.
Then a week later you'll try to find the longest distance you can run without looking at the display and you get shown 0.50 when close to collapsing
I have to disagree, with the right podcast, or the right music, I can look at the clock and be surprised it already been 15 minutes
13 years ago when it was summer going to 8th grade I found out I was type 2 diabetic. I began using the treadmill a lot. I lost a good amount of weight that summer. But I used to run in front of this tv. And while I‚Äôd run (well more like walk, I‚Äôd walk long distances) I‚Äôd have Ocean‚Äôs 11 on. I would always set up points in the movie wherein could check my progress. From what I remember, I‚Äôd look at it when they got the poker game with Topher Grace, when you meet Saul, when they initially all meet at the house, when the stripper nurse would give the card thing, when the twins would have the buddy/pal/friend argument, and a few other moments I can‚Äôt remember since it‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve seen it. It always worked for me. But it also came to a point I just knew how much I‚Äôd walk by the time I go to those points anyways.
It‚Äôs also like magic I had plank plank plank in my mind after reading the question and then the first answer I see is plank
For me when I do 30 seconds plank the first 15-20 seconds are a blip and it‚Äôs the last 10-15 seconds that feels like several minutes
I really didn't see your (at the time) 4 hour old comment before posting my Planck's constant pun on the plank thread. Great minds?
I do 3 sets of planks. Either every set or every other set, I increase the time by 1 second. Thats helped me increase my capacity.

Though, to be fair, I'm probably not doing it correctly.

I did the last one while watching a movie with my father. He walked outside and smoked. We speaked of nothing.
"Dad just looking at you with a sorrowful look in his eyes, slowly nodding as if to say ""Yes, this is a realistic experience, and love is dead."" A tear falls from his stubbled cheek."
"I think it's kind of overhyped. I did enjoy the show, but it took me like 3 times of trying it out to get past the first couple of seasons. Better Call Saul, however, (the ""prequel"" that follows the lawyer in BB) is a masterpiece. The story, the acting, the cinematography. It's all soooooooo fucking good. The last season comes out next year and I'm pre-sad about it being over. It's much slower than BB and I can see why it wouldn't be a lot of people's cuppa, but it's one of my favorite TV shows."
I don‚Äôt know, but it was pretty funny. Definitely going to be one of those things I remind her of when she is older! Funny enough, she is really shy about it with me, but is totally fine about it with my wife.

"Stealth deleting this comment because I was tired and bitchy and hadn't yet taken my meds when I posted it. Now that I have, I reread it and it was unnecessary and mean and I'm so ashamed that I have downvoted myself.

/u/zombiesourdough is correct."
That sounds the exact same as my experience. I remember looking at my ex and seeing her look happy. I was dreading the impending storm and her pain (and my own). I couldn‚Äôt even look her in the eyes. I assumed she was still happy because she hadn‚Äôt seen the baby. Ugh, that was truly awful.
I agree, that was a good OB/GYN. I tell everyone I know that is having their first kid. A couple have thanked me for it. Shit! That reminds me that I haven‚Äôt told my cousin. She‚Äôs due in the next couple of weeks.
What a great OBGYN! Very few people have actually seen a birth before they do it themselves. I think doctors and nurses may sometimes forget that this is the FIRST time for most people whereas they've seen hundreds and it's all routine for them.
I forget, but it was some kind of fluid I believe. They also put some ointment on her eyes to prevent infection (I *think* that‚Äôs why).
Posted this above, but apparently it's quite common for bits of meconium (poop) to float around in the womb and wind up in the baby's lungs. That's what happened with my kid.
Lol the image that gave me was hilarious. I was looking for a picture to illustrate it and instead found [a story about an Indian woman who gave birth and then walked 99 miles (160km)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/05/13/india/india-migrant-worker-gives-birth-walk-scli-intl/index.html). Absolutely insane.
That is heart wrenching... I understand why they couldn‚Äôt fill you in, but waiting in terror is awful. I could never work in the environment, it would absolutely break me.
Sorry that this was a difficult experience for you (and for your sister) but glad to hear that you were able to support her! Those 18 hours of labor were probably long ones too and I'm sure she's so grateful that you were there to help her.
Wow! That must have been insanely stressful. I totally get her reaction. I am really sorry all of you had to go through that. I‚Äôm glad to hear that everyone is ok.
That is terrifying. I was already in an out-of-body experience, if there was an umbilical cord wrapped around her neck I‚Äôd have just fainted. The umbilical cord is surprisingly thick. Ugh, I remember having to cut it. I was white as a sheet and on the verge of vomiting. The stress from thinking my daughter wasn‚Äôt breathing and then that was too much. I actually don‚Äôt remember anything after that. Pretty sure I just stood around like a zombie.
I‚Äôm very happy to hear he was ok. Now that I think about it, I have no idea how long the whole thing took. I *thought* it was several hours, but your comment is making me question it.
I think my fear lingered because I thought they were going to tell me there was brain damage from lack of oxygen or something. I had to keep confirming with the doctors everything was ok. Pretty sure they were laughing at me at some point. Honestly, the whole experience makes me *not* want to have another kid.
"That is horrible to go through. I am glad she was ok. It felt like my mind was trying to hide from reality, like it was desperately trying to slide into a universe where she did cry. 

Lol it‚Äôs surprising how loud they can be! Such a blast."
I‚Äôm so sorry you went through that. I‚Äôm glad someone eventually talked to you and that the resuscitation was successful. It sounds like a reoccurring nightmare I have. I was happy to read he was ok, I was worried.
"Lol your last sentence was perfect. 

That‚Äôs terrible. Based on all these comments, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be an uncommon experience. Idk why the midwifes or doctors wouldn‚Äôt go over this at some point with every patient."
"Awesome! Congratulations! I hope everything goes well. 

Glad that you were able to see this comment, hopefully others can benefit from it as well. I wish I had read something about it before going through all that."
Oh it was awful, my husband sat with his head in his hands looking entirely defeated. Our perfectly healthy son is now a few months off three, he came a month early too. I think he just liked to mess with us haha.
"Thanks! One of my daughters had some problems with her lungs and had to spend an extra week in the hospital but everyone is home and healthy now. 

It did rack up quite the medical bill which, as someone originally from a country where that isn‚Äôt really a thing,  it kind of broke my brain."
This is genuinely interesting to me. I‚Äôve never had anxiety about my debit card before. I mean sometimes I do where I‚Äôm like wait I do have enough money right? But I usually go to the store only after looking at my account. But also the main card I use. It is a 60/40 chance that it won‚Äôt work. The chip won‚Äôt function properly so I gotta do it three times then slide. Since this is so common and has been happening for years now. I don‚Äôt even care what the people behind me think. These chip readers suck. And I know it‚Äôs not my fault.
"Ugh agreed.

8 1/2 months pregnant and I had my first cervical check on Tuesday and that was even worse! And my wife had the audacity to laugh and joke with the doc as fingers were up my cooch about how I think pap smears are bad and how she doesn't even feel hers.

Wait until you carry the next one..."
I mean I‚Äôve had both many paps and many ‚Äúomg if I don‚Äôt get to a toilet now I will pee my pants this hurts so much‚Äù moments and honestly I‚Äôd rather have the pap.
Same. Had to be tested before my induction. I kept reassuring myself that the nasal swab wasn‚Äôt going to be the most painful thing to happen to me that day AND I WAS WRONG. I‚Äôd gladly push another baby out my ‚Äògina than be tested again.
Yeah I work in a nursing home.  Anytime I have ANY symptom of covid (which is any symptom of anything) I have to get tested, also, there is automatic testing every 2 weeks AND if someone tests positive, we all have to retest, resident's included.
I thought this was a reply to the pap smear comment. This whole subthread is more interesting with that in mind.
"I had my test done for travelling purposes and I paid for it, so maybe it's different than regular testing. They used one in both nostrils, and one in my throat. The nasal swab was uncomfortable but it was over quick, however the throat one cause me some serious discomfort.

And brushing my tongue is a nightmare, I always end up with teary eyes lol."
Yeah when they put it in it's numbed with a spray so it's not too bad, but once the sensation comes back it's like a permanent gag reflex or st. I never threw up or anything but it's just really unpleasant. Had to do some gastroscopies as well and there the tube is quite a bit wider but luckily they put me into narcosis every time. Ive heard people getting it done without drugs and they say it's the worst thing they ever experienced. Just depends how sensitive the hugula or we its called is i think. Mine isn't too bad, but i can't make myself throw up even if i wanted to so in some situations thats a disadvantage
Noooooooo! That‚Äôs awful. I joked with the nurse before my swab and asked if she tells people she pokes brains for a living, but she said she tells people she ‚Äòtickles.‚Äô IT DOES NOT TICKLE. lol

Tell her to use the digital ones which tell you via text display.  Cant second guess then. A lot less stressful.
She has an IUD, but gets nervous because they can shift a little and not be as effective as they should be.
"I've been snipped, and my wife is on a birth control implant. She still takes pregnancy tests when she has specific ""pregnancy symptons"", and it still gives me that pang of anxiety. Lol."
Always buy two tests. False negatives are a thing. Another tip, the cheapest pregnancy tests are 100% fine. Even the ones from a 1$ dollar store or whatever you have where your from. I did a 2 month work placement at a sexual health centre and they just used 1$dollar store pregnancy tests. The only difference is that the expensive ones look a bit fancier and are sometimes easier to get the urine on. Buy the cheapest and always buy two!
"Used correctly over a year I think 1% of couples will still have a baby.

So 1 out of 50 couples, wearing protection properly, still have a surprise baby each year. I think that warrants a 'longest 30 seconds' contribution."
"More likely they‚Äôre being downvoted because what they said sounds like a variation of ‚Äúyou‚Äôll change your mind‚Äù in the context of this conversation. Which is always tiresome to hear and mildly condescending. In this context it also sounds pretty dismissive, as if there‚Äôs no reason to be upset about a positive test result.

Obviously people are very happy to see a positive test result when they‚Äôre trying to get pregnant. And that‚Äôs great for them! But the first comment wasn‚Äôt talking about that situation, so that type of comment isn‚Äôt going to be received well."
They're getting downvoted because they're stating their opinion as fact. It's amazing for someone who wants one, but for someone who doesn't, it's a nightmare scenario.
Because the comment i replied to said taking a pregnancy test to find out for how fucked her life is? If it's positive, get plan b or get an abortion... Why would you have a kid you don't want and can't take care of???

I feel like it really depends on what you had your previous meal.  If you had something with lots of protein like an omelette for dinner at 7pm, I guarantee you'll feel fuller for longer than having something like pasta.  For the past 2 weeks I've been eating a large western omelette for a late lunch around 2 or 3pm, and haven't really felt hungry all night until the next day, around noon.
It wasn't too bad except for not being given much of a heads up. The guy who did it put one hand on my chest and went YOINK with the other. I barely had time to register the discomfort before it was over.

I think people greatly underestimate how easy it is to have your sense of direction get all messed up when in the water. I know people think too that if that happens, just don't panic; but it's really not that easy. Especially if you're being pulled by a tide or bashed by waves.

My apartment in Los Angeles got *rocked* by those quakes last year. The larger one tossed us around for what felt like 45 seconds.
Yeah, my first big one. I didn't know there would be aftershocks as well, I swear every 20 seconds there would be another pretty noticeable earthquake (5 on the Richter scale AT LEAST). By the 10th day I had already gotten used to it but the first two days I slept in the car cause I was afraid the house would come down on me lol
Just got me thinking... I didn't sleep through the aftershocks, just the main earthquake. To this day if I hear a noise that sounds like windows rattling I stiffen up, expecting to feel the building shifting, and I get a little anxious. PTSD is nuts - I can't imagine what it's like for people who have experienced so much worse.
It depends where it happened, where i live a 5.5 is small, around 7 is usually when people start talking about it but if you're not used to it (so buildings aren't prepared) it can definitely be big

"My first ever MRI they didn't tell me how long it would be. Had to lay awkwardly on my belly with my arm over my head to get my wrist scanned. My arms went numb within a couple minutes too, then part of my neck and both boobs. Cue a claustrophobia panic attack, trying not to hyperventilate and not to move, because I was trapped with my head in a box with pins and needles everywhere north of my belly for 45 minutes. Then I had to take the damned green line (Boston, miserable overcrowded up jumped streetcars) home, which is extra fun with your arm in a cast. 

I get Ativan before MRIs now (ask your pcp for a script for 2 before you get a scan. The pharmacist looks at you a little funny but no more panic attack)"

But then there are also patients sometimes who just don‚Äôt really think about it and don‚Äôt really follow the orders of the medical staff for no reasons at all, so I just wanted to give a little insight on how important it is for the medical staff as well as the patient itself.

I thought I was the only one. I‚Äôve had a couple of MRIs and I was actually disappointed when it was over. I found it very peaceful.

You literally could not drive that way in Los Angeles. The first time you needed to make a left turn, you would end up trapped at the light for the rest of your life.
I was taught to enter the intersection in driving school. As long as you've entered ahead of the lights changing you're good. I do stop if there is already someone in the intersection though. Also, rules may be different where you are.
What your doing is wrong. You have the right to enter the intersection if your light is green and the right to pass through after that when traffic allows.
Move the fuck up at the intersection or literally only one person at a time will get to turn left. The asshole behind you is right.
"You know most states it is legal to have 2 or sometimes more cars turn left when the light turns yellow/red.  By not doing that, you are the asshole.

I realized I usually see the same drivers any length down a road, whether they make it through red lights or not, and then I'd feel guilty for flipping them off (even though usually they're so preoccupied in anger or something other than the road (i.e. their phones) to notice or remember)."

I had to have mine removed and reinserted after I‚Äôd had it for a year and I was unhappy. It still felt worth it. No babies and I get the metal version rather than mirena so no hormones.
"> this is worth 8 years of no worries

I recommend taking a pregnancy test at least every 2 months while relying on a hormonal IUD as the only form of birth control.

IUD‚Äôs are not 100% effective and if you were to get pregnant, you might not realize it until around the 3 - 4 month mark due to many IUD‚Äôs having the effect of eliminating your monthly period.

In many countries, this means that you wouldn‚Äôt know you were pregnant until it was too late to have a legal abortion."
When I had my last one changed I asked the nurse if I could keep the old one. Put it in a little frame. That guy was a hero.
Not to freak you out, but my sister got pregnant with an IUD! She and her husband were done having kids...or so they thought üòÇ
Ok, this eases my mind a lil. Someone had commented they passed out from the pain and I was like uh oh.
My first IUD I was conscious. My second IUD I got in Germany and getting knocked out for it is apparently the norm. It was great. They led me in, a nice lady got my feet in the stirrups, and the doctor shot me up full of something that knocked me out in 5 seconds flat. I came to in a little resting room. Didn't feel a thing except for the after-cramps and soreness. 10/10 can recommend going under. It was so much better than the physical stress of insertion, which hurt so much I screamed a bit the first round.
Hahah yes I know what dilate means.  It just boggles my mind. I‚Äôve known two women now who have had hysterectomies because of dislodged IUDs.   Fuckin awful
Not quite. The Pap smear only involves the vaginal canal, where the doctor uses the speculum to ‚Äúopen it up.‚Äù The IUD insertion goes a step further and the cervix is also dilated (same as what happens during labour, which is why it feels painful) so that the IUD can be placed inside.
It's a tiny arm that is placed inside the cervix and defends the egg from encroaching sperm with swift and tactical judo chops.
That‚Äôs the plan. I just need to find out what my dentist gave me to take out my wisdom teeth. I didn‚Äôt give a shit about ANYTHING. Lol.
I just asked a few friends about it and only one mentioned pain management. She was given Vicodin and numbing shots. Why isn‚Äôt that offered to everyone? Crappy treatment of women in healthcare situations is alive and well still with so many things.
They nicked something putting mine in so it was a bit bloodier and a morning of pain, plus at least 2 weeks of the worst cramps I've ever had, but it's absolutely 100% worth it. I love not having to remember to take a pill and I don't have to worry about getting pregnant.
"If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what about the extra hormones in the hormonal IUD is a no-go for you? 
Personally I feel like BC gives me mood swings and makes me more emotional so I‚Äôve been considering the copper."
Ah fuck, I almost wish I could just leave this in forever. :( I guess that‚Äôs still not as bad as the insertion.
Yeah that's the thing, it was the absolute worst pain I have ever felt (I took the copper option), but knowing its 12 years of effective birth control with no hormone changes means I would go through it again. just maybe not anytime soon
This makes me wonder if there‚Äôs just some really crap/evil doctors out there because my insertion was kinda fine. A bit of pain, a couple of days of cramps, a couple of months of spotting - and then nothing.
If you are able to take the max dosage of ibuprofen (800 mg), it helps significantly.  This is also good for terrible period pain.  But best to ask your doctor.
"My old doctor pointed out that childbirth has a positive reward immediately after (""yay, a baby!"") where as an IUD doesn't have the same immediate reward, which is why it seems worse to a lot of women. 

So after getting mine placed she said, ""Yay, no babies!"" and I actually laughed despite the pain."
"Man, good to know. When I had my IUD inserted I was like ‚Äúis this pain similar to childbirth? But like, a fraction of that pain?‚Äù And the doctor and nurse laughed at me. 

I‚Äôm glad to have your perspective even if I don‚Äôt have a kid."
I've never had an IUD but can echo this sentiment about childbirth. Your body does a lot to get you ready. It's bullshit that people forget - seriously, ask a 90 year old about her birth experiences and she could tell you in detail from water breaking to final push.  However, it is a different kind of pain that doesn't compare to other things. It's very adrenaline and all the chemistry. Your body spends almost a year getting PUMPED, doubling your blood volume, etc. And you get more and more uncomfortable every day until you don't care how it goes.
I'm freaking out I'm getting mine in a few days and I was really chill about it until I read this and now I'm panicking
"I have had three IUDs total, and the two that were reinserted after my first and second babies were virtually painless thanks to the act of giving birth permanently altering the cervix.

I nearly kicked the doctor who put in the first one in his face though. The WORST pain and I wouldn‚Äôt liken it to childbirth because that‚Äôs gradual buildup whereas this is sudden and sharp. I was so scared when I went to get a new IUD after my first baby that it would hurt like that again. I remember being so tense and clinging to the exam table in fear but the worst part of it was the speculum. Nobody likes a speculum.

Edits: grammar, clarity"
As an evolutionary mechanism to keep women having more kids, women remember childbirth as less painful than it actually is
I've given birth twice, one with an epidural and one without and I'm terrified of the thought of getting an IUD lol
Actually, my third one was the only time the doctor made me lay back down because she thought I was going to pass out. Maybe it gets worse each time.
. . . Well now I‚Äôm really not looking forward to my future in five years since it‚Äôll also be time for my third one ( ;·ØÖ; )
"This made me cringe so hard.

I put off getting an IUD for so long because I heard it hurt, but Jesus fuck I couldn‚Äôt have imagined that pain. 

The worst part was mine took well over 30 seconds because, according to my doctor, My cervix/uterus is basically angled 90 degrees from m vagina (as opposed to straight). I seriously don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll get one again. I may just go on the pill again. My skin was better on the pill anyway."
I have a Mirena! And hearing that about Australia makes me so jealous! IUD pain was not fun! It sounds like it was worth it in your case though!!
The fact that the pain of this procedure can make someone jump and cause a perforation is enough reason to put someone under general anaesthetic or at least sedation.
After I got my IUD placed I wondered how women ever give birth without passing out/throwing up from the pain. It makes sense now to hear you describe it as a more acute pain since your body hasn't been preparing for it. But wow did it give me an even deeper respect for moms.
Sorry to be daft but as a pharmacist I had no idea it could be painful. Can you explain what happens that hurts? I would have thought they'd be engineered to be comfortably inserted else who would use them.
My removal wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúroutine.‚Äù I had been having severe cramping for a couple of days, and it turned out that it had tried to fall out and had gotten lodged in the muscle of my cervix. I can‚Äôt speak to what a normal removal is like. Sorry to scare you!! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine!
"I just got mine removed a few hours ago (and a new one put in). In order of descending pain for me: sounding, insertion, removal.  And she had to tug mine a little bit because ""Mirena loves you.""

It really wasn't that bad at all.  Just pressure.  She did offer me a hot compress to put over my lower abdomen, and that made a world of difference."
"Yeah I'm not a medical professional, but a friend did recently tell me that they had a similar worry, and when they looked into whether it was legal to ask for something more than ""just take some ibuprofen and deal with it,"" she found some laws around it, though they might have been local to her state."
I'll admit that I didn't have a good experience, but it's so worth it. Take some tylenol or ibuprofen before you go, it should help, and fingers crossed it doesn't bother you much!
Frankly, ibuprofen isn‚Äôt gonna touch it unless you take the max daily dose in one sitting, but it is better than nothing. I don‚Äôt know much about what is/isn‚Äôt safe for breastfeeding but do some research and take the strongest shit you possibly can
My doctor told me that if you've given birth before, it will hurt a lot less! I don't know how much it will hurt for you though, but I'm gonna take Tylenol and ibuprofen when I take it out. You can ask your doctor what painkillers would be best for you, but I would definitely not go without any like I did üò¨
"1. Yes, I was expecting it to take a lot longer but when my lady doc said she was done, I was like ""Is that it???"" They have to prep the area but the actual insertion is done in seconds.
2. During the insertion, it feels a bit like a sharp pain since it's a solid plastic or metal object being shoved into the cervix, a very small space. For dudes, imagine a small stick being forced into your peehole. It's pretty cringey. Immediately after insertion, your body will want to expel the foreign object for a few days so the uterus will cramp. Some people's bodies actually do expel the IUD, and that's not supposed to happen. The cramps feel like period cramps. For those who have never experienced cramps in that area, imagine the worst intestinal cramps when you are doubled over with the shits but you can't actually shit out the thing that's upsetting your digestive tract. So you just suffer through it until your muscles chill out. But then your muscles down there decide to spasm again, and so on. The worst part was a few hours after insertion but I felt a bit crampy for about 3-4 days afterwards. After then, I usually forget it's even up there.
3. Liquid bandaid is a topical skin treatment that can be bought OTC. I've never heard of using it for this purpose but I guess you could."
"It's three separate steps: 1) measure the depth of the uterus 2) dilate the cervix 3) place the IUD 

Every step hurts, but the final step is the worst in my experience. The last step is less than 30 seconds but it feels like forever because it hurts so bad. The whole procedure is less than 5 minutes in my experience. I'm not familiar with the liquid bandaid."
"It depends on the doctor honestly. The speculum takes the longest but actually getting the IUD inserted is only a few seconds. 
Different people have different reactions to it. I have cramps a lot from mine but other people don't even notice theirs. 
A liquid bandaid is this like brown liquid that they swab on you and it dries to protect the wound. It dissolves or something by itself. It can take a few days for it to flush itself out though"
"1. Insertion itself takes about 10 seconds, but when I had mine placed the speculum was in for like 5-10 minutes. Some women are hurt by the speculum, but for me it only started hurting when they clamped my cervix and started sounding it


2. Yes the clamping/insertion hurts the entire time. It‚Äôs also not uncommon to have cramps almost as severe as the insertion for the next week. If you‚Äôre particularly lucky (like me) you get I-can‚Äôt-stand-or-speak level cramps for the next few *months*."
That's reassuring. I don't know if I'll be able to think realistically about this though, because I'm so scared
"I agree that the pain itself is not that bad. Very unpleasant but doable. It wasn‚Äôt the pain actually that spurred me to almost faint. I am just prone to fainting in general (low blood pressure intermittently, especially in warmer months) and apparently the act of stimulating some part of your inner, inner reproductive system naturally causes some women to be light-headed per my OBGYN. 

So yes, it was an intense experience for those particular reasons but no, the pain was not so severe that I think it should deter you. Just to clarify!"
I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with that! If you‚Äôre getting an IUD here‚Äôs what I wish I had done: backup ride home (didn‚Äôt even think of this being an issue), take ibuprofen beforehand (I was given 800 mg right after the procedure bc I didn‚Äôt take any before), and have a heating pad ready at home. They should let you sit around for 10-20 minutes after the procedure to minimize the chances of you getting woozy. It‚Äôs really not that bad for most people despite the IUD horror stories we‚Äôve all heard.
Ouch! The original arm implant was like 5 or 6 rods instead of 1. Which old white dude decided that was a good idea??
"Yep, it‚Äôs likely to be less painful if you‚Äôve given birth before: 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5683140/"
I'm gonna take valium before I take mine out, but I'm not sure even that will be enough. I should really just get it overwith, because I just want it out of my body and it freaks me out thinking that it's in there. It's reassuring that I'm not the only one that got a bit messed up from getting it, though it is sad how many people have gone through this pain. I'm not planning on having children but I'd rather just take bc pills and regular pregnancy tests than go through it again. I hope you get through this without too much anxiety.
Should've maintained eye contact while continuing with your business. If they complain, accuse them of being a pervert because they're the one who broke into an occupied bathroom.

Hey, I don‚Äôt know the proper terminology, but congrats on the cancer survivorhood!"
"Dude, my local radio station reads craigslist lost connection ads, right? The other day, they read one, and apparently it was a dude reaching out to a woman who had accidentally walked in on him taking a massive dump. He literally said ""i hope the smell didnt offend you, i had indian food for lunch."" When she had walked in, he said ""hey beautiful"" and she ran out and slammed the door. Lemme tell you I almost ran my ass off the road listening to this lmao"
Glad you are a survivor.  I don‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù restaurants with one bathroom.  Eating often leads to pooping.
That's an easy way to get pepper sprayed as soon as you step inside if I was the one inside the bathroom.
I get that labeling single occupant bathrooms as ‚Äúall gender‚Äù or whatever is supposed to make transgender folks feel more welcome, but damn if it can‚Äôt be beneficial for everyone.
What a ride!!! Thank goodness I‚Äôm quick when people are waiting and try very hard to not be rude. That is definitely not how I would choose to go.  (Pun intended)
You're probably overloading your machine or have items that absorb a lot of water in there (blankets, denim etc). It'll adjust the timer if it thinks there's still too much water inside.
Yes! The time sometimes depends on how even the weight is distributed in the washing machine, therefore not consistent.
For all those recommending Adblock - is there any possible way for us iPhone users to do that within the app? I‚Äôve got Adblock on safari and it works, but not the app. The clunkiness of YouTube‚Äôs website is why I use the app. But the ads are absolutely fucking infuriating at this point. Every video has ads, multiple ads, it never ends. I wonder what it‚Äôs like to live in a world where you don‚Äôt have ads jammed down your fucking throat every 5 seconds from every avenue possible. It has the opposite effect for me, it makes me never want to buy your product.
Or the ones that are like 10 minutes long. You know they are using a whole show as a ad. Worse when I am in thr shower and can't skip it.
Try watching a 2 hour podcast. Ads every 5 minutes. I dont want to grab my phone to hit skip every 5 minutes and some of the ads are 20 minutes for some fucking reason so you HAVE to skip them
They're supposed to, making adds so annoying you'll pay for add free, like with spotify. Don't know if account sharing is as easy though.
I had a plumbing issue with water quickly leaking out of our hot water heater. Found a video on how to fix it, but first had to wait for 2 fucking ads to finish.
"""This is not a computer game. This is a browser game. You just go to a link and just start playing the game immediately.""

I fucking hate that ad and it plays before every video."
Compare that to television and it really isnt that much. 20 minutes show ant ten minutes as makes one ad every 2 minutes, so there is not much of a difference. It's just the presentation of the ads, that makes them annoying as fuck
I watched a50 minute documentary on YouTube. There were 25 ads for Joe Biden. 25! I'm trying to forget the world, and every 2 minutes Joe is telling me it is worse than I thought and only he is powerful enough to help me. Ahhh! Make it stop!
"The two main things people cut the cord because of is cost and ridiculous amounts of ads.

Youtube: ""well, if we only hit them with the ads, that's better and they won't go out of their way to get rid of those, right?"""
"At minimum allowing creators to decide when an ad is played would be a huge improvement. 

Unless they already do this? I've noticed larger content creators usually have less jarringly placed ads."
Maybe, but I think the big difference is the length of the advert. With a 30 second add, it's too short to do anything but wait. With a 4 minute ad break you can do other things in the meantime. I don't watch broadcast TV anymore, but I remember watching with family. Whenever the ads came on we'd just bullshit until the show came back. It was long enough to justify doing something else in the down time. But I do agree that people are getting more entitled when it comes to ad-free service. I see many people rage against ads on free content as if the creator doesn't deserve to profit from their creation.
"huh...weird. I think the change hit in earnest in the 80s. I know I remembered scenes from tv shows or even movies (""cut to fit in the time alotted""...) that I was SURE were in the movie or show and weren't there on later viewings...shows when I was little would get over like 3 minutes before the hour then the next show kicked off...it would creep further and further back to run more ads and more ad breaks were added in. 

The reason I don't recall longer ad runs bugging me was that was when I'd go take a bathroom break or food run. 

People used to get cable just to not have ads. Then it was only premium channels that didn't have ads...Disney channel started that way. It was glorious...then they all had ads and then youtube came along. No ads. More glorious. Ads then started popping up there...Netflix snuck in...no ads... etc etc etc. Netflix still has no ads during shows but it's nothing but previews for their shows while browsing now...aka ads for _their_ content. They considered adding ads a few years back and got an overwhelming response against it from their subscriber base. Hell, I have comcast cable and xfinity which lets you stream shows/movies has only a small section that's add free. 

The whole thing is nuts."
[Ah, the old reddit hooker-oo!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IdiotsInCars/comments/imbla8/dohh_its_not_your_turn_but_youre_in_a_rush/g3z3c4y/?context=3)
The fuck are you going eating oatmeal in a bathroom? And how? I have to breathe through my nose and I can‚Äôt open my mouth in there
I think if my bathroom was flooding I'd MUCH rather be inside the bathroom than out of it so I could try to fix the toilet and stop the flooding.
Also, it seems they used about 20% more than necessary and if they had just used less, this gag thing wouldn‚Äôt even be an issue.
"I had one done again recently for a... I dunno what it‚Äôs called in English, just a kind of brace thingy that prevents me from grinding my teeth at night. 

Anyway, my most recent (unhappy) memory of this procedure was from about 15 years back when I had braces and I was extremely anxious about it now... But I must say it‚Äôs better now. The stuff they use these days only needs to go in for like 5-10 seconds instead of a full minute, so it‚Äôs still uncomfortable, but... Being able to just hold your breath while it‚Äôs in there is a huge help. Was over before I knew it and I didn‚Äôt even gag once this time :) So that‚Äôs one trauma fixed haha!"
I hate that stuff! I had to get a retainer and they needed to shape it to the top of my mouth. It's very disgusting, though I never gagged
"I completely relate. Sometimes something like spit touches or ""attaches"" to my uvula and I after a compulsive cough or two I can suppress it so i can breath. But really gooey or chewy things near the back of my throat is the thing that sets off the gag/panic reflex really badly. Today I had a bag of gummy bears that melted together while in my hot car. I grabbed a merge of three and chewed them, and I thought I had chewed them enough and separated one, so I swallowed...they werent separate. *Somehow* I managed to keep it together and just breath evenly,  and then slowly chew and swallow till they all went down. But...well as the thread says, the longest 30 seconds you can experience."
I was never bothered by it the part that came out the back just pushed it out of the way with my tongue
"Took me 3 attempts for the top mould and they decided to just do the bottom by hand some old fashioned way...

Both of them came out wrong and didn't fit my teeth so I had to do it all again two weeks later."
I had almost ten of those done before surgery a couple of years ago. They needed about five of them for pre-surgery preparations, but the assistant was still in training and kept ruining them. Good times.
"As a dentist, I've dealt with similar patients many times, we get just as stressed but the trick is to actually numb your throat with some topical gel. 
This way the patient gag reflex is numbed and he/she only has to focus on breathing from their nose ( some patients get so confused and anxious trying to breath through their mouth and not feeling anything haha, have to tell them to relax and focus on breathing through the nose ) 
Other than that if it's not totally possible, is taking it with a sensor and 3D scanners. 
Also, there are many types and flavours and molds that can set in 20 seconds only with no taste or smell. 
Also, many experts can pull off a good mold ( we call it an impression ) by just putting the least amount possible, tilting the patient head forward and getting the patient to smell something very distinct and stingy everytime they feel like gagging ( like alcohol swabs ), and by also asking the patient to move their legs up and down or by giving the a stress ball and ask them to roll it all over their forehead and eyes and such, many examples of such things actually work for many people and make the experience less of a struggle."
"Yes!!!! 
I try to pick dentists that use film not those horrible new reusable things, and tell them to use the kids film. It works really well actually, I can tolerate that just fine."
"Go to the dentist. I went back after 9 years. It was ok but not great. Others have told worse stories. Go now. Catch up early

Edit: it has been fine relatively painless visits since going regularly. I don‚Äôt mind the dentist anymore"
Was it just having braces or the experience at the doctors office? I apparently needed braces, but never got them. But I did get a few teeth pulled but while knocked out and while awake. I actually preferred that to cleanings or the foam treatments. One time i had to use a different dentist to get a removal and he timed the local anesthesia badly and I realized how awesome my usual dentist was.  Idk I'd you had been to different dentists, but that might have been what affected your experience.
Braces are a torture device invented to enrich dentists off scared and/or shallow parents. Theres no medical rationale for them, if your teeth are so bad you need them you got other shit fucked anyway
That makes sense. From what you understand, will there be a better alternative to this in the future, or are we stuck with this technique?
When i got my braces, the dentist did a crappy job cutting the wire that goes through them so I had to be careful with chewing and talking for the next few months or it would cut open my mouth and make me bleed a lot
Nope, just the goopy mold stuff and the metal bit. Part of the reason I used to have nightmares about my orthodontist.
Some offices still use metal trays even though they‚Äôre up to date. Depends on the preference of the doctor/assistants.
"Ha, you lost one retainer? You got jaw surgery one time, and then just wore a retainer for four years? ... lucky

1. Get an expander on the roof of my mouth because I have an underbite.

2. Get a tongue guard because every time I swallow my tongue moves forward, which is causing my front teeth to basically not come up at all.

3. Get braces on my top and bottom teeth. 

4. Keep my expander in for months after the last time I had to use it.

5. Wear the braces for around 2 years I wanna say?

6. Take the braces off and get a weird giant double-sided retainer that I wear nightly.

7. Loose the retainer permanently at least twice, if not three times. 

7.5. Wake up many times with the retainer that started in my mouth now in between the bedspread and sheet at the bottom of the bed, or just straight up underneath my whole bed.

8. Get the braces back in, this time with rubber bands.

8.5. Alternate what types or rubber bands I‚Äôm wearing and where they go.

9. Get the braces off again, now with a metal wire on the back of my bottom teeth, a day retainer for my top teeth, and a night retainer for my top teeth.


This whole thing was around 4-5ish years."
There's a actually a way to help the patient if they have a bad gag reflex. Get them to take long slow breaths through the nose and to just focus on their breathing. It also helps if the dentist stands behind and supports the patient to lean forward and tilt their head down. Talking throughout it (it should only take the impression material 2-5 mins max to set) instead of being dead silent helps too. That old lady dentist sounds like a bitch lol.

Sadly I know those feels, but your not completely alone, shoot me a direct message if ya want (I think you can do that on here?? I'm felly new to Reddit haha). The thing you have to do is force yourself to move. Go get some hearty food in your belly and force yourself to do something you would normally enjoy (for example, that's surfing for me). If you don't have anything like that try something new and out of your comfort zone. I'm confident you can help yourself!!
"I asked this girl out one time. We were friends, but not really close, so I felt like it was a good potential date opportunity and put myself out there. It wasn't the first message between us or anything. She just left it on read.

I would 1000% rather get a straight rude response in return than no response whatsoever. It basically led to two days of self-consciousness until I concluded that she doesn't respect me, nor I her anymore. Fuck that shit."
I dunno, when the closure is that they were so disgusted they actually went out of their way to cut you out, I‚Äôd rather not know and live in blissful ignorance.
Yeah. I messaged my crush asking her out twice or so, with a couple of months spaced out. She never acknowledged those messages but kept talking normally when I resumed chit chat and other conversation. After the second attempt I got my own closure though. Removed the cutesy affectations from her name in my contact list and moved on
I had a girlfriend once that I was fighting with and I turned on read receipts just to read her message and not reply. Then I turned them back off.
but is the worst reaction possible (the most feared one) actually better than being left in an unknowing state?
Honestly I think it depends on the person like if I get left on read I don‚Äôt mind they are probably busy or not feeling like talking I do that to. But randomly getting blocked after two months of texting nonstop randomly that shit kinda hurts
That‚Äôs why I turned read receipts off. Because I‚Äôm that friend that will pick up my phone, read the text, reply in my head and *think* I replied or tell myself I‚Äôll reply in a minute then totally forget to reply. It‚Äôs just better they don‚Äôt know I read it at all.
Ex said we could still be friends and she could provide some emotional/ career support as a friend. I naively believed that.
"Is it really that big of a deal though? I mean, just move on with your day? 

Or is there some bigger implication I‚Äôm missing?"
I don‚Äôt get this. Who keeps their notifications on? You‚Äôll never even know if I read your text. It just creates an expectation of immediate response, which is unhealthy and in business can be counterproductive.
Got ya. I think I realized it after making the comment and thinking about it, that‚Äôs worse. You know they read it, but didn‚Äôt care to respond.
"Meh, reminds me of the Dr. Seuss quote: ""Those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind."" There's a pretty clear line between ""whoops, forgot about that message"" and you having some serious discussion that someone who's important purposely disregards. That person might be important to you, but clearly by this behavior you aren't important to them. Which is totally OK. Letting someone go or focusing on relationships that you don't have to apologize for basic things are the ones you should cultivate."
"There's plenty of good reasons to be unsure and plenty of irrational but otherwise fairly normal reasons too. I don't think we have enough information to really read into why someone would say something like that but getting into some kind of ""real"" relationship can make people anxious."
She‚Äôs trying to gauge the likelihood that you will hurt her.  If she says she likes you back, are you going to tell your friends and laugh about it?
"By the way you write I can tell you are a squizofrenic persone. Which is a huge red flag.

Nothing wrong with that, though. But I might consider walking away."
"The post you replied to was, ""The moments after sending a risky text and you see, ""So-and-so is typing..."", but it keeps starting and stopping."" 
Moments, not days. Which words did I put in your mouth?"
Yeah the double text after an hour of no response is usually not a great look. Just gotta play it *cool*
And half the time it buzzes  it‚Äôs like the Wish app or something just telling you about some shitty sale going on.
Sorry. Thought you typoed Bears and I literally meant Grizzlies. Otherwise like you say, if I'd gone through what you've gone through I'd understand you better. People can be scum. You do you and trust whoever you feel comfortable trusting.
I did, we no longer speak. I realized I was basing my self worth on her approval of me, which in a way encouraged some of her behaviors. I'm a lot better now!
Yeah anxiety is bloody awful! People need to appreciate how others feel before sending those kind of messages. I mean who sends those kinda messages anyway??
"Woah, I have this exact thing too. A ""hey"" text sends my mind into ultra overthinky panicky friend-therapist mode.

My friends now, different ones, send a ""hey"" text as a greeting. But I panic and reply ""you okay? what's up?"" and they respond like ""lol just wanted to show you this cat video"". Every time it happens I lose a year off my life"
"Next time somebody tells you that, tell them, ""Ok, while we're at it, I've been meaning to tell you something for a while  too but let's save it for tomorrow."" We go down in anxiety together, asshole!"
It's pretty horrible. If I suspect someone of doing this these days, my trust in then just completely shuts off (I'm still polite). I know it sounds extreme but that's what I'm doing until I can figure out a medium. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that, it can be a long way to healing for some so I wish you the best.
"Or at least fucking say what your problem is.

If you have time for a voicemail, you have time for a text. And if you have time for either, you have time to just say what your goddam problem is.

I get so mad when friends or family do shit like this, or even worse, when people text me, ""hey"". Just text me what you want to text me! We don't need these 3 extra messages to establish that we're talking now!"
"That's why if I'd rather talk on the phone for something like that but I'm unsure if the person can answer right now, I'll text ""hey can I call you? It's not serious just don't feel like texting"""

The most sinister two words if you have an active imagination. I usually _have_ to call so I don't stress myself out with the possibilities.
This happens so often with my dad. 90% of the time, he's leaving a voicemail longer than I allowed time for. 9.9% is because he's got grandkids over, and they demand his attention as soon as he's off the phone so he sets it down and walks away, expecting that I didn't answer because I was asleep. 100% of the time it's stressful for me because of the one time he didn't pick up because he was driving my stepmom to the hospital.
Cheers, use it in good health. I get the occasional odd/questioning look but that‚Äôs part of the appeal.
I havent had one either, but your mum will always be your mum, unless u raped or killed someone and even then Sometimes they still wanna be your mum, an SO can leave, tell you you fucked up bad, tell you she cheated or anything else
The good one's don't reset, they allow a few seconds of on/off for you to pause and spit, then restart.
You're using too much toothpaste. You shouldn't need to spit. It should be the size of a pea, NOT the full length of the brush.
Same. Now I use expensive non-SLS lots of fluoride shit that costs $6 a tube so you bet I‚Äôm rationing each pea sized amount
My ex would put on so much toothpaste that spitting no longer was an option, at least not in his brain. He would just lean over the sink and let it drip out. And he complained about how I didn't want to have sex.. Fucking gross.
"This. 

When I'm staying anywhere but home, I have to bring my own pillow, or lay a ton of paper towels under my head. I salivate at full force practically all day every day. If I don't swallow or spit, my mouth will be full in half a minute."
"You only need the tiniest drop off toothpaste to do the job. 

However some people just make a lot of saliva, and this guy didn't think about that possibility"
Interesting, as the general consensus from professionals and the web is to spit not rinse. Maybe it's specific to fluoride toothpastes which flood the market anyway. Would you mind sharing your toothpaste brand?
that‚Äôs very well put‚Äî it‚Äôs a Tuesday. Different class of human being in my opinion and 100% agree they deserve so much respect. I am so thankful for my mom‚Äôs surgeons because she‚Äôs had the same ones since she got sick over 30 years ago and they were just starting as residents. They feel like part of our family, it‚Äôs sad and beautiful in a way!

‚ÄòIn the emergency room.‚Äô

‚ÄòWTF that sounds terrible!‚Äô

‚ÄòNope was alright actually.‚Äô"
"I guess I'm usually really focused on the cake, I'll ooh and ahh over it with my hands clasped in front of my chest when they place it in front of me. I'll admire the candles, maybe think up a game plan on how to best cut the cake, compliment whoever baked it as an aside. I'm also usually so happy in that moment that I can't help but smile the whole time, and I'll look around at my friends and family to see how they're singing and laugh if anyone's acting really goofy with the song.

I've never really thought about what I do during happy birthday but I think that gives a rough idea? Hope that gives you a clear picture"
Agreed, unless this man was somehow traumatized on his birthday this is an absolutely ludicrous response to a somewhat awkward moment
I was gonna skip over the comment because it was too long, but the last line was like a bomb. Now I've gotta read the whole thing.
One of the worst things I‚Äôve ever experienced was after minor surgery where I had to have anesthesia... apparently for some people, it can take several hours for your bladder to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù even after you‚Äôre conscious again. I had to go SO BAD and couldn‚Äôt. I was in the bathroom sobbing hysterically because I couldn‚Äôt pee and was in agony. (Seriously, birthing my daughter didn‚Äôt hurt that bad.) My husband was about to take me to the ER, but I finally got it out. When I had to have the procedure repeated a month later, the anesthesiologist made sure they cathed me while I was under so I wouldn‚Äôt endure the same pain. It still took several hours for my bladder to work right, but at least I wasn‚Äôt in agony while I waited.
You wanna know the worst part? Like 30 minutes later I had to have the guy stop the bus again. I hid behind a garage this time and had to use my under shirt to wipe this time. I was quickly running out of clothes.  It was a horrible day.
I know what you are saying. You become afraid to go anywhere that won‚Äôt have a bathroom nearby... afraid to go for long walks or hikes. Planning all your meals over where you‚Äôll be or what meeting you might be stuck in.
"Yeah i aged out in 05, and still remember those scores from 08 far more vividly than any of the retreats i was actually involved in.

The especially bitter part, was that IIRC BD had been undefeated that entire year, and only lost that show on Finals night, by .025. That Phantom show was phenominal and they definitely deserved the win, but i think that 08 BD show is still my favorite show design of anything i've ever seen put on the field. Seeing them lose like that was heartbreaking."
Or for those of us who just take the heat like an idiot ‚ÄúHASRHASHAHAHRAHSHAR-‚Äú while we to continue to chew food that‚Äôs HOTTER THAN LAVA. It‚Äôs like an ice cream headache. You wait for it to go away... then what do we do? EAT MORE ICE CREAM! Seems like the only *logical* course of action.
"Where are the other lifeboats Carl?

Well, judging by the trajectory of the moon and the sun... Probably somewhere at the bottom of the ocean!"
"Yeah but there‚Äôs a right way and a wrong way to say that. Like if you‚Äôre joking around and have a good rapport with your friend, that‚Äôs fine, you‚Äôre close enough to say that without hurting each other. But if you say it sincerely to someone, regardless of if it‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs gonna be hurtful. If you really want to comment on their appearance, maybe note they would look really good if they did A or B.

Obviously if it‚Äôs a personal hygiene thing, you can be slightly more blunt since they really need to correct their behavior."
">...if my heard rate goes to high.

I mean, I feel like the One Lord shouldn‚Äôt have a heard rate. All sheep should be allowed I thought."
A school ordered restraining order basically. She wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk to me or come up to me for anything. We were working on a giant group project with 30 other students
"There were tons of people in the room but none of them noticed her cursing or yelling at me till I fully broke down. Then she was a major teachers pet and the teachers would always get her out of trouble.

While I was still having my break down she emailed the dean to explain her side. The dean told me that it seems like she was really sorry and it was a misunderstanding until I showed him the video. He was speechless and no one ever really talked about it after."
Unfortunately most people who dont experience disassociation will not be able to understand what it feels like. Just make sure they understand that it can be pretty terrifying at times so that you‚Äôre on the same page

It's like you've been holding back on this huge sigh of relief that you can finally let go of.  I also like to think of it as taking off this heavy winter coat that represents the person you're convinced you need to be everyday.  There's tons more going on with the experience but attempting to describe it only highlights the shortcomings of spoken/written language.
"When I was first diagnosed and prescribed insulin, it was really intense when it would get low (huge change being down below 60 from years of 300+). My fianc√©e walked in the kitchen to see if I was good and I was just standing in the back corner staring at her and was like ‚ÄúStop! Please stay away from me!‚Äù She didn‚Äôt look like herself at all and I was panicking bad. It‚Äôs gotten better of course, like I can keep myself calm, but back then I had multiple episodes where it was like I went psychotic. 

Side note, I hope you‚Äôre doing great! Type 1 diabetes is a beast and non-diabetics really can‚Äôt understand what we go through on a daily basis. Especially days where we fuck up and strap in to that up and down roller coaster. It can be tough, and can feel very lonely, but as long as you‚Äôre on reddit and can remember my username you have support if you need it!"
"Yeah I sometimes find this to be too much of an intellectual exercise in the middle of an anxiety attack.

Other times it works really well for me. It's good to have a lot of tools to fall back on."
"EMS checking mine helped too. Determined it was not heart related, then asked if I had recently drank coffee. I said yes, about 4 cups. Turns out caffeine, lack of sleep, too much alcohol, and stress are my triggers.

For a while, I took .25 mg of Xanax during an onset. Them going away quickly after taking one really helped me sort of condition myself to acknowledge that it‚Äôs just anxiety and not impending death. I now don‚Äôt need to take anything, since I rarely get them anymore."
"Oh, I definitely went to the doctor, then a cardiologist! Thanks for the concern and recommendation, though. Had 2 EKGs and an echocardiogram, all of which generally indicate I'm fine. It's pretty unanimously assumed this was caused by stress, as my job has been insane over the last few months.

You're right in that it did put me at ease quite a bit, but I still have enough lingering discomfort, so I'm trying to learn how to meditate and any other methods to deal with stress better."
Mind saying what movie it was? I had my first panic attack when I saw Gravity in IMAX 3D lol. I was like 14 and it was an unbelievably scary feeling
Man, same! I'm almost 32 and in good shape, I was so confused at the possibility of it being a heart attack! My hands and face become so numb and tight that I had to dial 911 with my knuckles and could only mumble to the operator. Now that some tests have indicated my heart seems fine, I'm going to see if exercising helps, since the nearly-constant tense, heaviness in my chest is driving me nuts.
It's great you have someone with you who knows what it's like, because severe attacks are not something most people understand. I'm fortunate that my mother knew exactly what was happening when I called her during my first one years ago. Hope you find something to help keep those feelings away.
Whoof, yea, it's such a confusing, terrifying feeling the first time and it just feeds into itself by making you more scared/stressed. I don't blame your wife for being so worried. Wish I could always be as chill as and sure that everything would be fine as your 3-year-old, though!
Yup, all the same stuff happened to me. It's comforting reading other people's experiences. Sorry about your job, though. I've called out for the last 2 weeks and I know some people will think the same as your job. Honestly, fuck 'em. Your health comes first and these people who will work through every ache and pain will pay for it later when their body and mental health start failing early. It's okay to stop and bench yourself for a little while, to recuperate. Don't let them guilt you into thinking otherwise.
I‚Äôm trying really hard to get better at just riding them out and breathing through, but I think it‚Äôs worse when I haven‚Äôt had one in awhile and then get out of the blue. It‚Äôs like its new all over again and when I feel the palpitations and racing heart, shakiness and lightheadedness I am 100% convinced I‚Äôm going to die right there. It‚Äôs tough to not panic about your panic.
I think I know what you're describing, but once it evolves into a full on attack, it's impossible for me to be rational. Takes away the ability to convince yourself that you're not going to die.
"I see panic attacks mentioned on Reddit all the time... what are you guys panicking about so much?

Is it really panic for no reason? Is it existential dread? Is it a sudden fear of the meaninglessness of your own existence? Is it the fear of suddenly dying for no exact reason?

I‚Äôve had extreme, extreme anxiety with the help with psychedelic drugs but it was never absolutely meaningless. There was always a theme to it, whether that was ‚Äúoh fuck I‚Äôm going insane‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm losing control over my mind‚Äù or ‚Äútime is moving so slow I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to be trapped in here forever.‚Äù"
My first panic attack I thought I was having a stroke. I legit thought I was dying. Some then I‚Äôve had ‚Äúworse‚Äù attacks, but none have ever been nearly as scary because at least I know it‚Äôs just a panic attack and will pass.
Seriously after soo much of energy invested in the act we are expecting atleast 6 inches but to our disappointment is hardly an inch

Ok you got this we are hydrated. Start running oh ok I got this. See the clock wtf I'm only 50% done and it's been 11 minutes fuck."
Yeah, ppl will do an hour of excruciating cardio, burn a few hundred calories maybe, and reward themselves with double the amount of calories that they burned. I think the happy balance is doing any cardio that doesn‚Äôt feel like torture to you to earn some extra calories, but most importantly, eating the right food. The right food is food that you can enjoy, will fill you up, and let‚Äôs you stay in a healthy deficit. If it doesn‚Äôt check all of those boxes then you‚Äôre bound to fail. Starving yourself is unnecessary, unsustainable, unfun, and unhealthy.
Yeah, exercising will help your metabolism and give you other benefits like stronger muscles, heart, lungs, but weight loss is basically all diet. Obviously if you can, do both
"Said this the other day.

Same, and sometimes I can just be thinking and it goes fast, no music or podcast. It's like meditation.
If you're interested, It's an exercise that you get better at pretty fast, which feels great. I'm adding like 5 seconds every other day I'm up to 2:10 right now, and I'm not an athlete or anything.

"https://youtu.be/pgJa7gVs9qg

Kinda this but chest height not higher and crossed wrists. Although I don't think that's strictly needed."
It is rare, but yes it does happen. I have not heard of an incidence of it this happening in the U.S. for awhile. It mostly happens in areas where pregnant women receive little to no prenatal care and birth at home without medical attendance. A doctor, seeing a birth where the baby is going to tear badly, will likely perform an episiotomy to prevent tearing into the urethra and beyond.
"I left the hope that someone will wish me. It bought a smile on my face. Thanks fellow redditor.

Edit- Thanks to all the fellow redditors who wished me. All of you are breathtaking. You made my day.

"This made me smile. No effort is mediocre. You don't know how can it affect people.

Well, I or my parents can't feel comfortable being in the same room at the moment, so the best way is to find a way to get out of the room.

That was literally the most awkward thing. I was squirming. Felt so bad for Walt. Jesus, Skyler.  At least put 10% effort in my god.
That was a terrible thing for her to do. A lackluster handjob, mocking him for not being hard, her disinterest, her condescension... I'm not at all saying Walter didn't do terrible things, he became a monster. But that intro... Fuck, he would have been better off with her giving him lube and a porno mag.
I'm gonna give BCS another try based on this. I've watched BB three times though now and enjoyed it more and more each time. BCS lost some momentum for me after season 2 I think.
I had the same issue with BCS though. There‚Äôs just something about their style of storytelling that bounces off of me. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad just might mean it‚Äôs not for everyone.
I'm not sure if your post is a statement of your opinion, or if it's meant to be sarcastic. Would you clarify?
No it isn‚Äôt. I was reading books on parenting, communicating with kids, exercises to help cognitive development, the psychology of children, etc. I should have done more research into what to expect during the birthing process. I did some, but obviously not enough!
I don't know whether this is sarcasm or not. If it is: Except how would you even know what to look for if you don't even know that you have a preconception about something that's different in reality? That's why it makes so much more sense for health professionals to point that out. Clearly this doctor knew exactly what kind of idea the parent had in their head and why.
"I watched it while I was pregnant and I‚Äôm glad I did but also it was maybe not the best choice of entertainment for me while heavily pregnant. Part of that ‚Äúreal portrayal of birth‚Äù is late term miscarriage, still birth and mother mortality. I was already terrified we would lose me or the baby and it didn‚Äôt help on that front. 

It‚Äôs a truly amazing show and I‚Äôve rewatched it a couple of times now. Very informative and the characters are all very well flushed out. You should definitely watch it but prepare to cry."
"Yes, he is a great doctor! He's been practicing for 30 years so I'm sure he's delivered 1,000 (+) babies and got used to the things new parents worried about. 
It was also handy that there was a new nurse who was observing, so as her mentors were telling her things I got to learn, too. (It probably helps that I gave birth at a very nice and big Mother & Baby unit)."
"I'm guessing it's just the amniotic fluid. Babies practice swallowing and breathing it in the womb, so the fluid is gunking up everything. Suctioning their nose and throat is pretty much the first thing the nurses do after delivery. 

My youngest wasn't breathing well at birth so she had to spend her first hour or so on what was basically a mini-CPAP.   but she was totally fine after that. üôÇ"
It all happened so fast to be honest. One minute it was we‚Äôre gonna go Ahead and do a c section since it‚Äôs been so long, and the next his heart rate was dropping and it was very suddenly an emergency. Ultimately everyone was ok. He was healthy and my sister recovered really well.
It was definitely an experience. I‚Äôm really not a baby person to be honest, but the father isn‚Äôt in the picture and our mother passed a little over 2 years, so I was the only person she was really comfortable having there with her. There was lots of confusion with the hospital staff during the stay, from one nurse thinking I was her wife to another mistaking me for the mother and telling me how good I looked for having just given birth. Ultimately everyone was ok and they‚Äôre both healthy and happy now.
My parents say they were completely stunned too. Me being their first born, they had no idea anything was wrong until the doctors started moving. I‚Äôm so glad (both for my life and their sanity) that we have the medical equipment now to deal with these things.
Yeah I thought it took like two hours but the records show like 20 minutes so my whole memory is completely off during the moment.
"The terrible part was:
Another doctor sat down and started stitching my wife. While she's doing that, a nurse is holding a phone to her ear. The dr says into the phone:

 ""ok so we've got massive internal bleeding coupled with significant tearing. Can we prep surgery 2 and get her sedated and ready asap, I'm really worried about time here so I'd like to rush through blah blah blah (medical terms).""

I'm freaking out and still stupidly sitting where I can see the dr stitching my wife's private parts. Wife is oblivious. Dr then says

""Ok I'll come straight there when I finish this one. Yes this one is fine"" and hangs up.

SHE WAS CONSULTING ON ANOTHER CASE FUCKING WTF DON'T PLAY ME LIKE THAT!"
"Wow, yeah sorry man. I live in the communist utopia of Canada, so I was only was faced with the dilemma of ""pay for a private room during recovery"", not a stack of bills.

Hope you had insurance or something else to help shoulder that. But glad everyone is healthy and home now.

Be well dude. Much happiness for your family."
I just don't wanna get... Karen'd? For lack of a better word? Been going through a lot and I'm not sure I'd handle it well.
It‚Äôs been nine years and I still remember the cervix check. And my doc was a dude. I had to drop a few choice words that day. Ugh the discomfort.
Same, are there people out there getting painful paps? Mine was a complete non-event. Having your bladder full to the brim with no bathroom in sight, however is the worst.
">I'm honestly more personally upset by the male mutilation 

I'm guessing you're male.

Both forms of circumcision are disgusting and wrong. But FGM is objectively worse because it is designed to completely eliminate all sexual pleasure from the woman, and also requires further injury and physical trauma to the genitals.

 Despite how fucked up and horrifying male infant circumcision is, the truth is that most men who've had it done still enjoy normal, pleasurable sex lives. The same cannot be said for victims of female genital mutilation."
Surprisingly no, he barely even has a scar.  The plastic surgeon said that as far as desperation moves go, that was the best thing he could have done.  It kept the tissue together well enough that it lived, and he didn't need any grafts.  He looked like hell for a good month, had to have plastic surgery, tooth implants, etc.  But if you were to look at him today you'd never know.
"True, but even those work by detecting a second line, and then just outputting ""Negative"" or ""Positive""."
Nothing wrong with double protection. I still wrapped up when my ex took the pill because my desire to have children is equivalent to absolute zero.

I've had them try and slip off especially if there's precum going. But I also don't use them after blowjobs, which according to my friends responses, not everyone knows not to do that"
I have one!!! He's 6. Took 7 tests - just in case. I was married and we already had another kid, but had decided to just have the one. My little guy had other plans. Best oopsie ever!
"Yeah I understand it‚Äôs not 100%, and thanks for the info and links!

I just meant it‚Äôs kind of crazy for his gf to take one that often."
Ah, I guess that could be an interpretation. I didn't read it that way, but I definitely agree that's super condescending and no one should have their choices scrutinized like that. Thanks for showing me another way of reading it.
Well, the original comment stated their opinion as fact as well. I don't think either is wrong, but you're right, it could've been stated better.

The hardest part was just lying (I eventually told the truth bc we had to document the error) to her about why they had to forcefully stab her again in nearly the same spot (back of pelvic bone, iirc) with the biggest f‚Äôn needle ive ever seen. I lied and just said it was long and skinny when I held her hands. 
But the whole experience is traumatic. At the beginning, you just have no control. It isnt until you have a moment, after the emotional and physical shock, to do any research that you can try to advocate for what you want."
Boxer briefs are where it's at. Junk is kept in place and no inner thigh chaffing. Best of both worlds.

I now live near active train tracks.  I quite often will suddenly stop and freeze when I feel something vibrating or hear something rattling to prepare to take cover as I have been fooled a couple of times already.  I really can't tell the difference by the noise either.  At least it keeps me on my toes.
Our buildings were *mostly* prepared (not in the city tough) but yea its like the biggest one in 100+ years here.
I mean a lotta stuff got damaged so I'd say so but we don't get them often. This was the biggest one in 140+ years lol.
I rarely feel them coming. I've tried a lot concerning water, like holding it for 30 seconds or drinking 1 liter on ex. Drinking upside down works best for me.
"First MRI I ever had: ""geez this is loud as fuck""

Most recent MRI: falling asleep and hopefully not snoring"
"> I get Ativan before MRIs now

They gave me Ativan before my recent MRI but it didn't take effect until literally four hours afterward! At the scan, my panic attack won out and I had to cancel. 

On the second attempt they gave me special right-angle glasses, something like [these](https://www.amazon.com/vinmax-Spectacles-Horizontal-Glasses-Watching/dp/B01MXF4QXP/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=right-angle+prism+eyeglasses&qid=1599265368&sr=8-5) except specially made without metal. These directed my line of sight to the well-lit office outside the bore, not to the scary roof a few inches above me, and that made *all the difference in the world.* Survived the 30-minute scan with no issues and only a very mild OTC sedative. Needless to say those'll be required equipment if there's a next time."
This is good to know! I couldn‚Äôt perform my second scan when I went because after the first I had a full on panic attack. I definitely should‚Äôve told my psych about it :(
"Oh dear god I can relate.  I went into my last MRI and had sinus issues from allergies.  Couldn‚Äôt clear my throat and had a straight panic attack.  They had to pull me out.  Said I was ghost white and wanted to cancel the MRI.  Talked them into just letting me drink water, clear my throat and I got through it fine.  (Fell asleep).  Queue a few years later and at the dentist.  Horrible panic attack that had me messed up for 2 weeks.  Can‚Äôt do dental work now without being put under.  Feels like I‚Äôm drowning.  If I ever get water boarded I would tell them anything everything.  They would end up kicking me out of there I would talk so much.  

Nope."
Seriously, how hard would it be to give an estimate of how long it should take and ask if you'd like them to announce the time passing??
This reminds me of a fun story... was on the bus and sitting in a high bench seat facing the aisle and didn‚Äôt realize my body was kind of half asleep from sitting so long until I stood up and proceeded to stumble and nearly fall into someone‚Äôs lap...
I have pretty broad shoulders so when I got into an MRI for the first time it felt like my shoulders were being squeezed into my collar bone and they made me lay there for like 2 hours. They should make MRI machines bigger to make the 98th percentile comfortable too
You know how they usually put you face up, feet first? When I had a breast tumour, I was rolled in face down, head first.  Truly the stuff of nightmares.
Yeah, a lot like how dealing with a corpse is much more inconvenient than providing a Heimlich maneuver
Oh that‚Äôs another one of my favorites! I want to *feel* it hit me. I‚Äôm a weirdo though, I even kind of like the burning of propofol when they push it.

I'm coming up on a year and a half and I'm able to live on my own and take care of myself now! I still have some lingerie issues, but we are dealing with them as they come and they are not stopping me from them in my life and that is the best I can ask for after that accident.

I really hope someone can take some benefit from this. cuz I wasn't there and I can understand just wanting to like shift around and move around and do something. I distracted myself by thinking that I was in the middle of a zombie outbreak and all the sounds were the alarms. still, I understand people wanted to move around and not understanding how important it is to stay still and I really hope they gave some understanding from this thread"

"Wheres the 60 year old thats never once in their life used their debit card or saw a machine that accepts debit cards?  That person finds me a LOT

""OH, it says press yes to continue.  I press yes?"""
"The banks around here in the Northeast US have just started to roll out contactless cards. We're behind the times a bit compared to other countries when it comes to bank card tech. Most people still swipe or use the chip reader.

I recently got updated debit and credit cards with the contactless feature. Got a letter/email only a few months ago noting the new update to the cards moving forward."
Yeah, a lot of people in this thread seem to not understand that in a fast-paced job like fast food or grocery stores during a rush, those single minutes absolutely add up and cause problems later on. 1 old lady wasting 3 minutes at the front of the line is 3 extra minutes for every person behind them. 5 old ladies doing the same is an extra 15 minutes for every person behind them.
I never said it wasn‚Äôt frustrating, but you seriously sound like you have anger issues over it, it‚Äôs really not that big of a deal man. I can‚Äôt imagine how aggravated you get at real life issues
Because of impatient people behind me/way too fast check out workers I have forgotten twice to take my cards out of the card reader while putting my shopping away and never saw them again. Social anxiety is real, people, shut the hell up!!!
"Do you experience any other side effects? I'm terrified of the hormonal effects of birth control because my mental health is kind of wacky right now (working on it, taking meds and stuff) so I'm interested in a copper IUD, but I'm also soooo scared of the pain. And my periods can be pretty painful, does it help at all with that or is it literally just to prevent pregnancy?? 
Sorry for all the questions I didn't mean to ask so many

Edit: I'm overwhelmed (in a good way) by the in depth, varied, and honest responses I've received!! I love women and I love how quick we are to band together and provide insight when it comes to our bodies and periods. It makes these conversations effortless and more natural. I'm at work so I can't reply to everyone but I'm very grateful!"
I did horribly with the Mirena and got it out within a few months. They said the hormones wouldn‚Äôt affect me but maaaan, they were wrong. If I ever need get into a LTR where I need birth control again I‚Äôm thinking of getting the copper one. Have you had decent results with it? I heard some people have worse periods but I‚Äôm kinda willing to take that risk.
I've only had the cobber IUD and I have never had such intense cramps and bleeding. I would randomly pass out because my IUD would pinch my vagus nerve whenever  I needed to poo. Yeah. Fuck that noise never again
This happened to me and then I had the SECOND ONE COME OUT like 2 months later. Needless to say I did not try for round 3.
"I misread this as ""the mental version"" and momentarily thought you'd found some kind of magical hypnosis birth control. If only..."
Is the removal bad?  I got the Copper IUD over a year ago now and I just remember how intense the insertion process was.  Literally felt like the wind was knocked out of me.  I mean, thankfully it lasts a long ass time though.
How do you like the copper one with no hormones? Any side effects? My doc keeps trying to push it on me
Yeah. I would not recommend it though although I lowkey like being put under. I'm not comfortable doing stuff like that to my body just to avoid pain. Second time I got an UID I was awake and I do prefer that. Also you bounce back quicker.
im surprised reading that peoples cramps lasted a short while. i was constantly aware of my uterus for 3 months because it was constantly cramping. whenever i drove especially my cramps would be almost unbearable. i would pity myself and cry everyday...the pain was so terrible. but i stuck through it in hopes of finally not having a period- worth it i haven't had my period in about 5 months now.
Not the person above you but after some pretty intense research I went with the mirena which does have hormones. I also found the pill completely messed me up hormone wise but then I found out that‚Äôs because the pill has to have huge amounts of hormones to get through your digestive system whereas the hormonal iud is localised so it can deliver a really tiny amount. Plus you‚Äôre more likely to have no periods at all on the hormonal one which cinched it for me because I was having a really bad time with cramps.
"Honestly I don't have a crazy story or reason for disliking hormones; I'm just a bit of a hippie and my body does a perfectly fine job of making its own, so I prefer not to add any.   I have been on hormonal birth control in the past and found I was a bit more mood-swingy and my weight distribution shifted weirdly, but it wasn't anything ridiculous.

I highly advocate for the copper IUD.  The only downside in my opinion is the cramps can be a little much sometimes.  My period only lasts 3-4 days but it fits a solid 7 days of bleeding and cramps into that span of time."
"Mirena is a very small amount of hormones. To put it in perspective for you, I have a blood clotting disorder that is exacerbated by hormonal BC (it's a risk with every estrogen based BC for everyone actually) but I had the mirena for 10 years and doctors okay them for people like me since the hormone levels are low (and it's progesterone only).

It was a great 10 years! My husband and I are TTC and I have to be in blood thinners because getting pregnant and all those hormones are just as dangerous :-/"
It was 10 wonderful years, that's for sure.  The part I didn't know when I had it removed was that they suggest waiting 3 months before placing a new one!  It was a strange 3 months for my spouse and I feeling like teenagers with our condoms again, haha.
Yeah, same. I got one inserted a couple of months ago, after my first baby. It was uncomfy for sure, and the first one didn‚Äôt unfold properly so they had to start over with a new one, but it wasn‚Äôt the worst pain ever.
"It‚Äôs also because the oxytocin and other hormones associated with recovering from pregnancy and raising a new baby  encourage the brain to prune those memories. No sleep is GREAT for not remembering stuff.

Though you got what you consider a reward (no unwanted pregnancies, woo hoo!), I don‚Äôt think your think your hormones care (that was unpleasant, up the dopamine, let‚Äôs remember that shit)."
"People remember birth so well partly because they tell the story so much and think about it. Both my births were unmedicated, and my second kid was an off center home birth, so I pushed for 6 hours. Even with all that, I definitely only  have memories of memories. Compare that to my husbands almost ptsd of me being in that much paid and him being so scared for his wife and child.

Hormones with a baby are ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to prune the memoirs of birth and make them less vivid. Add that in with the sleeplessness of a new born, and it‚Äôs not a great situation for strong long term memories.

If everyone remembered the experience of birth as vividly as other pains in life, there would be less siblings."
"It hurts a lot less than an unwanted positive pregnancy test.

Take max ibuprofen, and take some deep breaths. It's worth it."
"Ibuprofen, super deep breaths, something to distract yourself. I recommend a stress ball or something to squish since your body will probably want to clamp down while the doctor tells you to relax...
And then it's over for 5-12 years."
"Wait, like RIGHT after you gave birth and that‚Äôs why it was virtually painless? Or are you saying it should be painless *anytime* post-childbirth? I had a 9 lb. 10 oz baby vaginally so my cervix was probably stretched to the max; the IUD went in 9 years later and it was **terribly** painful.

Edit: I just saw your edit and I realize you don‚Äôt mean immediately after childbirth (which wouldn‚Äôt make sense). I‚Äôm jealous. Not the same situation for me!"
"Oh god I‚Äôm so sorry! If you don‚Äôt mind me asking what kind of IUD did you get? 

I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre from but my sister in law told me that in Australia (where she‚Äôs from lol) they knock women out (with anesthesia or something like that lol) to put IUD‚Äôs in, and I literally wanted to cry cause in the US that‚Äôs not an option even with insurance!

I was on the pill for 6 years and it was great (also helped my skin so much lol) but I started having weird reactions to the hormones in it (puking my guts up every night for months) so I had to stop taking it.

I tried another lower dose hormone type but that also made me puke lol, but yeah when it worked it was great!

I hope that when your IUD expires you can get on the pill again though!

It‚Äôs so much easier to take a pill than having a piece of plastic or copper shoved up your vagina!"
"Nice! Mirena is good for 10 years I think lol so hopefully you won‚Äôt have to worry about it for a while!

And ugh right?! It would be so much easier for everyone if we could get knocked out lol! No pain, no accidental moving, no worries about angled cervix and uteruses making the process longer! It would be so much easier lol!"
"Right?! 
If you‚Äôre sedated/put under you also won‚Äôt be as tense in general! 
I was super tense cause I was so nervous and my doctor had to keep telling me to relax my legs cause I just wouldn‚Äôt open them, and that was before anything was put in!
It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs a bias against women in medicine or something, but that would be crazy right? /s"
"-‚ÄúDo you give any specific pain killers for this?‚Äù

-‚ÄúOh, right... you can take an ibuprofen about an hour before the appointment. That should cover it.‚Äù

It did not cover it."
"Your cervix as a woman is closed to keep your organs in place. In order to insert an IUD, you must force the cervix open and push a rod through it into one of your internal organs. You have to keep pushing until you touch the top of the organ so you can measure it, then you insert a device that pops open in the organ itself, scraping along very sensitive membranes. You then pull the rod out and let the cervix close back up. It can be easy or it can be excruciating, depending on your cervical tension. For me it was excruciating both times, but somehow still worth it.

For a man it might (might) be somewhat analogous to shoving a large bore rod down the penile urethra without any prior dilation or lube, then rummaging around in inner base of the penis, then pulling it back out."
"Post below describes it well- they're putting something where your body does NOT want something to be. ""Sounding the uterus"" (measuring it) is important to ensure proper placement, but it does usually mean you're poking the inside of the uterus with a stick for a second. You're also passing through the cervix, which is another unnatural thing your body does not want. I'm not sure how much more comfortable the *design* could be. But I said elsewhere that I think practice is essential. 

Hardly anyone in the US got an IUD before the ACA covered them- my first one cost nearly $1000, which is crazy, but I was going overseas for a long time and wanted guaranteed uninterrupted birth control. I bet until a few years ago most American doctors put in at most a few each year. Contrast that to Europe, where lots of women have had them for decades and horror stories are much more rare. I think the doctors are getting better at handling them."
"> ""just take some ibuprofen and deal with it,"" 

Love women's healthcare. We should be given real pain management for an IUD. An Advil isn't gonna help at all. Maybe if I take 12."
"Out of sight, out of mind. I'm personally very queasy regarding things like veins, bones, muscle, etc. I have a hard time checking my breasts for lumps because just feeling stuff in there is such a yuck for me. So the prospect of a little metal thing in my arm where I can press it and be like ""hehe rod in arm""

God, I'd vomit.

Edit to add that also invasive stuff in medicine doesn't bug me, so that was never a concern. Doctors gotta check out the cooter regularly anyway, so not much issue in giving them another reason to lmao"
the comparison you made for pain made me squirm. props to all women brave enough to go through that, and i really hope you all found it worth that pain. thanks to everyone that helped answer my questions!
Weirdest thing that happened to me recently is I was biking up a really tough hill and I saw on my fitbit my heart rate was dropping instead of going up.. that‚Äôs when I stopped and laid in the grass for a bit lol. I don‚Äôt weigh enough to give blood but I know I would pass out if I did. Getting blood drawn is okay but I always ask for butterfly needles!
The manager was unlocking it.  They had told him it was locked and he didn't bother to find out if someone was in there before he went to unlock it.
Thanks! Preciatecha! I'm pretty sure I did write about it on yelp. Benny Vitales pizza. Bring your own walking stick to prop btwn the wall and the door.
This was before that became a public issue, it was something about ladies room having to have a diaper changing station, or rooms with a changing station cant be unisex, or something IDK anymore.  I do know last time I was in  the town the wine bar that got renoed had 2 unisex bathrooms so maybe its fine now.
And sometimes I don't even know if I want to watch the video, I just saw it pop up and wanted to see i what it was but it's only 5 minutes long and YouTube expects me to wait through 2 unskippable 30 sec ads. Then another 2 half way through. Fucking ridiculous
I just repeatedly reload the page until it doesn‚Äôt give me an ad. More often than not it takes a lot longer but it‚Äôs significantly more satisfying.
I think YouTube recently added more ads to videos over 10 minutes by default. I was watching something where some YouTuber was saying that YouTube added two ad breaks into all his old videos. So he has one at the start(that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs set his videos to have, before the video really starts, then two were added somewhere in the middle because of a change to policy.
Dog, they‚Äôll put a 5 second skippable ad but not give you enough time to hit skip when the the ad is done so it automatically starts the second ad which takes 2 more seconds to load. On top of this ads will play at the beginning as well as the end. So if you‚Äôre watching a playlist or whatever it‚Äôs possible for the video to end play two ads, start the next video but with another two ads and you‚Äôve had 4 ads in a row. On top of this are political ads which are like 15-30 minutes. Can‚Äôt listen to a Lofi livestream to sleep to without waking up to a overly loud 30 minute ad seminar about some fucking company. The only ad that was okay was the trailer for the LEGO movie 2 which was just the entire first LEGO movie and old spice.
"Even more so when the ads are longer than the video you want to watch.  I've seen YouTube ""ads"" that were over 4 hours long before."
If I didn't have uBlock on desktop and Vanced on mobile you could not pay me to watch YouTube videos. Every time I accidentally open a YouTube in incognito mode I am fucking astonished that someone made a business model doing that to people.
Unfortunately, the best solution I can find other than buying premium is deleting the app and using the browser version with an adblocker on safari. But that doesn't work super well so I mostly just live with it or watch on my computer with an adblocker
Yes I‚Äôve been searching for the exact same thing. On the iPhone sub I was recommended Brave but that only works in the browser. I‚Äôd really like to just pull out my phone and watch a 5 min YT video in public without having 2 unskippable ads EVERY fucking time.
"Why? After I saw the first ad was unskippable I would have found a different video.

Of course I also use adblockers so I rarely see them anyways."
You can actually skip the ads. All you have to do is just jump past each yellow ad bubble and you dont have to watch them. It works most of the time, but sometimes YouTube gets picky and if you try to jump past it the ad will run anyway. Still better than sitting through all of that garbage, though
That's how they got me to pony up for Spotify Premium. 5 ads back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back. It's worth the $9.99/month though for the offline listening and unlimited skipping.
"I don't imagine them requiring it, but giving creators advice on how not to lose their audience while still getting part of the ad revenue would be appropriate.

I'm sure they do this to some extent.  There are some videos with good ad placement, so I have to assume creators have some control over when ads are displayed."
"I picture it ideally as a collaboration; surely it could be done like tv show makers designing places in the show for a pause for commercial. Communication is key to success.

Edited typo."
Ooh, okey, glad to know it's still bypassable, I may use ABP then until they patch this in the Opera built-in adblocker, this has only been happening since a few days.

Yeah I literally just posted about how F'n horrible it is because they overfill the thing by WAY WAY too much like it's some kind of sadistic joy for them.
For me it wasn't only the goop they used but also the mouth tray that holds it. They only had a kid and adult size one and it would go so far back I would instantly start gagging.
Oh my gosh, I am laughing so hard after reading your post.  I know exactly what you mean!  Been there done that.  Lol!
You've got to find an updated dentist that uses the big x ray scanner that just rotates around you head for 20 seconds! Nothing in your mouth, 20-30 seconds nd you're done.
Yes! Discovering the kid sized ones was a game changer! No shame. Bring me the kiddie one Mr. Dentist, otherwise we‚Äôre gonna be here a while!
"I had a couple orthodontists and dentists.  First off, braces hurt.  And they hurt for days after every adjustment.

Second, your mouth is just constantly bleeding and injured from the wires, random catchings, etc.

Third, I got kicked in the mouth and the force of it knocked off three brackets.

Fourth, I had wisdom teeth removed and had a bad reaction to the anaesthetic.  Just straight up panic attack for a hour afterwards.

I hate teeth and everything about them.  I panic going into the area.

If you offered to knock me out and give me implants that will never get fucked up I'd take it in a heartbeat."
"3D scanning has gotten rid of the impressions for a lot of procedures - it's quicker, less painful, and allows for correcting of minor mistakes without having to restart. And they're getting less expensive every year. 

There's still a few things here and there that require impressions (namely for procedures on people who have some or many teeth missing, like for someone getting dentures, since it doesn't capture gum tissue well). Basically at this point, it depends on if the provider wants to invest in a scanner. Most things you'd ever need these days that would require impressions can be done with the scanner instead"
"Ugh, it sounds like you‚Äôve been through hell! Honestly, dental pain is just awful. After my surgery, I have nerve damage and numbness all in my cheeks and jaw and I‚Äôll get random shooting pains in my jaw. I know I needed the surgery though and I guess after hearing what you deal with, I am lucky that I don‚Äôt have any other dental problems. I am very fortunate that my underbite was fixed with braces and surgery. I look like a different person and while I still have pain, I can breathe better, actually be able to smile, and I am more confident.

Are you able to get the surgery for your underbite? I had BSSO surgery (lower jaw plus a  Genioplasty) and despite the numbness and such, it improved my quality of life significantly and I do recommend it (recovery was quite difficult, but I got through it). It was $10,000 with insurance, plus a $2,500 fee you had to pay right away. I was so jealous because the girl in the recovery bed next to me got it for free lol. This isn‚Äôt including the cost of braces, which I‚Äôm sure you are well aware of!

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been through so much. I hope it gets better for you and maybe you can get surgery."
Yes, for now. But I will have to go back to school eventually, where it happened. I have to admit that I‚Äôm afraid to do so.
1000% correct. I have never suffered a chemical imbalance or any kind of severe depression. I totally get it and I wish you the best.
You're fine, buddy. :) I'm usually not good with conveying myself through words at times, part of being an aspie lol. I'm glad that it helped you contemplate more though.
A co worker I knew once had her boyfriend break up with her via text. After the usual back n forth, she sent him 5 pages worth of text explaining how this was insensitive, and really just put her heart on the line. The text stayed unread for 2 days. Even I wanted to destroy him after that.
I was about to say something to try and make you feel better about the situation, but I swear the last sentence made me go ‚ÄúYESSSS‚Äù out loud loll. You made such a beautiful and important realization!!! I feel like a proud friend lol ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"This doesn't really help the situation, but for a bit of relevant perspective: from what I've picked up from my sisters, friends, and the small percentage of /r/niceguys posts that aren't completely fabricated, some guys take rejection really, *really* poorly and become straight up verbally abusive when they get a direct ""no."" Some guys become extremely emotionally manipulative to the point of threatening suicide when they get a direct ""no."" These guys are the extreme minority, but since they don't get dates for obvious reasons they end up blowing up at a lot of different girls. So after a few times of having an otherwise nice guy completely blow up in their face after saying ""no,"" a lot of girls think the lesson is ""never, ever say no,"" because it's much easier and safer for them to leave things ambiguous. There are also just cunts who enjoy attention with no commitment and leading people on, but if a non-shitty person leaves you with no reply, I'd bet it's because she's had a pretty terrible experience in the past that she's trying to avoid repeating. It's not fair, but it is what it is."
"One time when I was in middle school I asked out a girl by text message, after I got her number from a friend. I poured out my heart, and waited for a response that didn't come until the next morning. I was so anxious all night. When I woke up from my restless sleep I had a text that said ""Who is this?"" 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was too embarrassed to ever text back."
"I was an anxious mess with body dysmorphia in my late teens/early twenties. I‚Äôd get a message from someone who I had only met a few times at friends house or something and I‚Äôd agonize over my response to the point eventually I just stopped doing it. I preferred to distract myself with something or talk to someone who I knew better and didn‚Äôt feel so awkward with. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize it until looking through Facebook messages a couple years later and noticing how many people I just ghosted. Feel bad about it now, but it really had nothing to do with them. I just didn‚Äôt know how to handle the situation"
Maybe she didn't knew what to answer or didn't wanted to deal with the situation that comes before or after answering or didn't wanted to deal with her own feelings, or might have thought you had just been nice to her because that was your intention all along. Anyways left on read is in all cases except combined with an apology later, a rude no, so it's the same move on
"So is ""left on read"" an iPhone thing? I've got Android and it doesn't say anything like that, as God intended."
Migbt be pretty awkward the next time she sees you in public. Would have been much better if she responded instead of just leaving it.
I‚Äôm in pretty similar situation right now. I asked out one of my colleagues since we were flirting a lot at work and she said yes. Later the same day she called me to reschedule because she was pretty sick and i know for a fact from work that she was. 1 week goes by and i‚Äôm like let‚Äôs go out tonight, but she apparently had plans with her group of friends and invited me to go together which i denied of course. Then i started ignoring her just saying ‚Äòhi‚Äô and she comes up to me asking me why i don‚Äôt talk to her and why i‚Äôm mad at her.. I tried to explain politely that there‚Äôs nothing to talk in front of 5 more people and that‚Äôs why i asked her out and she replies i know i feel the same way, we‚Äôll go out these days. 3 weeks later we haven‚Äôt gone out yet and i told her good that we went out right, to which she replies ‚Äòi know i‚Äôm awful etc etc.‚Äô To which i told her look if u think i‚Äôll be the only one trying to make something happen, it ain‚Äôt gonna work out to which she left on unread. Next time we catch up each other at work i started ignoring her again only greeting her, to which she pulls up the same bs and asking me if i‚Äôm gonna pull back again and asking me for my schedule and to set up a date. Since then 2 weeks passed and we‚Äôve been in opposite shifts and tomorrow is the first time we‚Äôre together at work but i‚Äôm rly fed up of all these dumb games even to the point i‚Äôm not sure if i wanna go out with her anymore. Gonna ignore her again and not give her any attention and see what happens. Sorry for the long whining and bad english, but i‚Äôd like to hear ur opinions üôè
That is such a legit question though. Why just leave us hanging in that moment? There is literally 0 consequence there. I really would like to know the logic behind just saying nothing rather than a simple no. I asked my girlfriend once and she said it was ‚Äúeasier.‚Äù I left it at that but I am really interested to know why this happens in depth.
"Unless you‚Äôre on Tinder or a dating app, it‚Äôs never appropriate to ask someone on a date in text. If you see them face to face, grab a hold of that courage and put yourself out there. You‚Äôll save this situation from happening, and get the response you never did, and you won‚Äôt feel helpless when denied. It will help you with rejection handling as well. 

Apps are a different story, but even on those, you Lee texting to a minimum and close to a number in 5-10 texts maximum, and close to the date within a few texts. Save the small talk for the in person, you‚Äôll thank me later for that, as you may run out of things to talk about otherwise."
"Women don‚Äôt respond rude or even just honest or even just respond because they get so much violent and misogynistic backlash on the regular.
They may have done it in the past and gotten threatened for it.
I have a friend who does an entire blog on dating-site threats from men. Your reaction and assumptions to just the ‚Äúread‚Äù alone is nothing compared to the verbal attacks women get from trying to let someone down gently or bluntly. 
If you were in those shoes you‚Äôd see if differently."
"That must've hurt or annoyed. There is an option besides taking it personally, in a lot of cases. That's to just keeping friendly, upbeat, confident around her. If she brought it up, just laugh in a low-key way say you thought it would be fun.  Act like nothing happened.  Now, she may move toward you or she may never move toward you -- but taking it personally takes her off the table completely.  It also helps to show in other ways, without making a big point, that you have ""game.""  These are things that I never did early on, but learned.  I would have been waiting for that text.  Or more likely, I wouldn't have been brave enough to even put it out there in the first place.  A lot of times the female wants to see that you won't back down (I'm not talking about creepy persistence from someone she obviously doesn't like -- that is different. You said you guys had some friendliness going on.)  If she doesn't respond, she hasn't given you a no.  Now, there are situations in which a clear no is better than a maybe.  But in this case, so long as you are chill and don't obsess about her, a maybe can change to a yes.  Getting back from a strong no is usually harder."
"I would argue that you *did* get a rude response, by her not responding.  Direct isn't the same as rude.  In this case, it would have been so much more respectful for her to simply say something direct like ""No thanks I'm not interested""."
I think you went 0% to 70% in one second. You might've waited for more closer friendship. Anyways that is horrible. I also had this experience but on Internet, not in real life.
"Why didn't you follow up? Why wait for confirmation? Why not send a second text, or even call, if you like her enough to ask her out there's at least a chance you've spoken to her in person before so you are well in your rights to follow up with a "" hey what's up are you not interested in me that way? We can stay friends """
I was depressed for a year because of this exact scenario. The thing is, when you are kinda in love, you see these things as a sign of doubt or struggle from the other side. But in reality it's not even a 'No', it's a 'you don't even deserve an answer'. I wish I'd realise it in two days like you did, haha
"I've explained that to a lot of girls. I've heard the excuse so many times that 'I don't want to hurt his feelings'. It's like yeah.. But ignoring him will hurt more than just saying 'sorry, I'm not interested'.

I think a lot of people just really struggle saying no to anyone and women have to say no to dates A LOT more than men do."
Maybe she was consulting *every single effing one of her friends, family, and nodding acquaintances* about how to respond.
women never ever look for man cause apparently we're not worth it, but then we are supposed to chase them, society is broken from the start
Even if they don't have it on, you can kind of assume after 12 hours or so, they would've definitely seen it. But of course there's still that uncertainty, which is the worst part
"I have the same feeling when left on read so I only open my messages when I have time to respond


Otherwise I'll be like ""i saw this. I'll get back to you when I can"" so they're not thinking I'm ignoring them"
Why does it matter if they‚Äôve seen it, unless your message is specifically urgent then there‚Äôs no reason they should have to reply straight away, I don‚Äôt get why people would get angry because somebody doesn‚Äôt have a thought out response or is busy with other things.
I leave it on to force myself to respond to stuff. I have a bad habit of seeing a message and meaning to respond to it, and then I put my phone down and forget about it. ButI personally hate being left on read so I don‚Äôt want to do it to other people, so I force myself to respond.
I like the feature. But I think ghosting people is cowardly and don‚Äôt mind telling people when I have a problem with something. I think communication is a highly valuable part of human interaction.
People who leave read receipts on are psychopaths. They should not exist, hands down. I do not need that anxiety in my life
"I have a friend who does ... I sometimes wonder if he even *knows* he has read receipts on, because he‚Äôll occasionally say things like, ‚ÄúSorry, I just saw this!‚Äù and I want to say, ‚ÄúWell, no, it‚Äôs 9am and you read it at 11pm last night. Just reply to the text without mentioning the delay, I‚Äôm not offended you didn‚Äôt write back at lightning speed. üôÑ‚Äù 

I totally use ‚ÄúOh, oops, just saw this‚Äù when I‚Äôve been too mentally exhausted to reply to a text ‚Äî which is often ‚Äî but I‚Äôve had read receipts turned off since 2015, partially for that reason."
Thanks so much for mentioning this...I had no idea! I've always wondered why some people's messages show as read, and others do not. Turned that mother off! There's another notification that shows when you're typing? Crazy that the default is set to on.
I do it so I have alibis. You can see the message without opening it fully often, so I'll read it, open it up later than then pretend I just saw it.
"I have an android and every so often, someone with an android will upgrade or something, and the ""delivered, read"" and those dots appear. I basically immediately work on our settings to make that go away (they always have to change settings on their end too). I don't want that information."
For real. Though I really need to stop opening messages with the the mentality of, 'I'll read it now then reply later' 'cause I usually straight up forget. A few mates of mine are exactly the same though so we're very understanding with one another in that sense lol
I'm amazed people use text messages to ask important questions. If you want an answer, ask in person or at least phone them.
Yes but if the closure isn't as bad as *that* then I would prefer to know so I dont have to worry about what you said being a possibility
Yes but you don't know what the message is necessarily. It is almost definitely not the message you wanted to hear, but you still don't know if it's because they don't see you as worthy of their time, or if they are just interested in someone else and it's not necessarily anything against you. Not knowing where you stand like that is painful
Yeah but at least it feels somewhat better if they tell you an answer even if its a negative one because at least they give you the respect to at least give you an answer,idk if it really made sense what i said but i guess you got what i wanted to say
I had a girl leave me on read and ignore me, a month later I started talking to someone else and got bitched out cuz ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt put in enough effort‚Äù
No, it only means that nobody sent you a text in that time. Doesn't mean anything at all in regards to the question being asked, and it's silly to assume so. When she ignores you to your face, *that's* a message.
"No it's not. 

I leave people on read by mistake all the time because I'm ADD as fuck.

Others leave people on read on purpose because they're too lazy and/or cowardly to conclude something.

Still others leave people on read because of status/power games to make them text again.

It's not a message. It's an action that can be interpreted many ways, and could mean nothing, like the equivalent of a cough IRL.

Except when it happens to you, you have to basically guess which one it was, because the appropriate response to one will make it worse if it's actually one of the others."
It's so baffling to me why people don't just call. You are asking someone out. You want to text them, okay. You know how many times my friends say they get my texts I sent days later after I sent it? Or not at all? It happens to me often. I missed a date with my ex because I never got the text she was out of work. Like just CALL ME that's going to go through and if it doesn't you'll know. You also don't have to sit there waiting to find out you know immediately. Lack of confidence maybe? Idk
"I hate this mentality. It requires so little effort to send a text. Even if it's just a ""no"" at least it gives some type of closure. It's sad to me that people have this little respect for others."
"Anxiety is a real bitch. That's kind of like telling someone with depression ""just be happy.""

The situation here is you just sent a risky text that you are emotionally invested in with a desired outcome (for what most people are referring to here, that would be dating the person you're texting). So ultimately, you just put yourself in a vulnerable position, and the other person didn't even bother giving you a response. This can lead to a ton of self loathing and doubt. In addition, you don't even have the closure of being turned down or blocked, which would have been helpful to move past it. Like so many people responded here, there are certainly innocuous reasons to be left on read, so you may end up making excuses for the other person and dwelling on it so much longer. Yes, you shouldn't do that, but again: anxiety. It's hard to control."
Or you know, don‚Äôt be creepy. If someone blocks you, regardless of the reason, just don‚Äôt try and contact them again
"I wonder if it is a generational thing

I used to exchange letters with my cousin.  I'd mail him one, he'd get it in a few days, he'd write back a week later, and I'd get it a few days after that.  And that was the fastest it ever went!  Sometimes it'd take him a month to write back.

Everyone's life these days revolves around their cell phone and I think it comes at the expense of patience.  Not just because it makes people impatient but because the world as a whole moves faster and society has expectations."
"This was so much worse than just a no :( but what can I do. I've learned answer when the next girl comes around, I'll be able to do this better 






Now just need to meet a girl lol"
"Well hopefully she can work through that. It sucks, just constantly getting in your own way and self-sabatoging. And then someone ""helps you"" with your self esteem but really you're just putting your ego into their hands - dependency. Or maybe they really don't control your ego but you're worried about that manipulation so you stand off far too much. 

Not saying you do any of that obv. Just oh man I empathize with low self esteem it affects eeeeeverything"
"By they way you write, i can tell you‚Äôre a fucking idiot, which is a huge red flag. 

Nothing wrong with that, oh wait"
"If I offended you I apologize, that was not my intention. I tried to write it in a way that people who suffer from those mental illnesses wouldn't feel attacked or feel that i was saying a relationship with them is lesser than a relationship with a ""neurotypical"" person (or person with no mental health issues, which i don't believe really exists), i don't think that's the case at all. In fact, I think it's often a much more colorful and deep relationship, the highs can be really high but the lows can be really low too. Obviously this is super generalizing, which is a bad idea when talking about relationships because each relationship is unique

As someone with a generalized anxiety disorder, ADHD, and I think an undiagnosed borderline or attachment disorder (which i think may really be the cause of the other two diagnoses, and the other two diagnoses are just symptoms) I was kind of talking from experience. I actually end up pushing people away if i get to close to them and it feels like they might hurt me, it's something I struggle with, and often don't realize I'm doing it until afterwards. I say ""kind of from experience"" because again, I'm undiagnosed

But, I do have a background in mental health care, and actually worked as direct care staff for kids 14 to 16 years old at an inpatient psychiatric facility, ended up running the unit in an interim role for awhile. When I say ""run"" i was actually a care coordinator who managed the day to day schedule for the kids and worked closely with therapists/psychiatric nurse practitioners/psychiatrists, I'm not qualified to diagnose or anything like that, but do have my bachelor's in behavioral neuroscience. So point is I'm not just speaking out of my ass

I've come to realize a relationship with me can be... tough, but I'm still on good terms with every single ex, but am not in an emotional place to date anyone right now. Which is why I said ""I may walk away if I felt like I wasn't in an emotional place to handle that kind of relationship"" because I know what that can entail having dated people like that and being one myself. For example, codependency can turn into a real fucking shit show, been down that road before, we both were able to recognize it eventually and decided to end the relationship and actually did so on good terms, but damn it got really rocky there for awhile abs and really didn't like the person I was turning into

My background and struggles don't just make it ok for me to say whatever I want though, or make my opinion right so want to, again, apologize. 

If you or someone close to suffers from an attachment disorder or borderline, I just want you to know I don't think people that suffer from those conditions can't have healthy relationships, or that they are people you should never date or avoid, but I don't think it's unfair to say a romantic relationship with people that suffer from those conditions  with its own unique set of challenges.

Like all relationships, they come with their own set of challenges, and depending on the issues one may have a relationship with someone who suffers from those MH disorders could turn out badly for both parties."
Well, no. It's a distanced relationship so like, we talked the entire day on discord until she fell asleep.
Reminds me of the 3 day game/rule. The idea that you wait 3 days to get back to someone you‚Äôre interested in early on in knowing them if they show interest in you. The thought is, that while idealistically we should all just be up front and honest with how we feel, we aren‚Äôt. So, by waiting 3 days, you don‚Äôt come off as too eager which might be a turn off, especially if they felt like they needed to ‚Äúwin‚Äù you over. More than 3 days might allow them to lose interest or let the mystery if you‚Äôll get back to them wear off.  Apparently, 3 days is the sweet spot. Except, now just about everybody knows the 3-day rule, so if you use it, they might just think, ‚Äúwhat a dick...used the 3-day rule on me.‚Äù
Me expecting her to respond quickly. I never did. I literally told her to take her time (of course you didn't know that). And it was like that the moments after sending the text. And then it stopped. Until 3 days later. I guess I can't be mad at you, just some context missing.
"People like me who don't even realize they had an issue with something until much later (because various psychological barriers) but want to work it out with the person instead of slowly building resentment over weeks/months/years of time. So then you can discuss it with the concerned person anytime, but don't want to say too much over text in order to avoid misunderstandings. 

I feel bad to blindside people when it takes me a while to realize things, on the other hand, it seems better to get it off my chest and give them a chance to explain , if it's a serious enough issue. And at that point I'm ready to communicate calmly and rationally instead of big impulsive reactions and hurtful jabs."
We still splitted on good terms. It was years ago, but I still remember the anguish. Thanks for the support, though.
I got the ‚Äúsex talk‚Äù on the sky ride at our favorite amusement park...30 feet above the ground in a slow moving gondola lift...and then again on the same ride a few years later when my sister got a little older
"We need to talk....later.

What? What the fuck?  Why?  Tell me now or wait till later entirely.  YOU'VE RUINED EVERYTHING"
No, just break up pre-emptively. Then they'll realize they miss you and come back to you. I mean, that has to be what happens, right?
It would be so nice to have someone ask me what I want for dinner! I wouldn‚Äôt even mind the tense future talk.
yeah we really muddied communication giving us a bucket full of communication options for people.  some friends we basically didn't respond until one of us was the last to communicate in all our messaging applications, as we didn't like to pester but hey if I don't see an outgoing text from my side sitting there unanswered I'll send one in the mix even if all the social media messengers have an unanswered outgoing.

About the time, weed has a similar effect but it gets weaker every time you smoke,like: the first time 10 minutes seemed like 2 hours,the second time it seemed like 1 hour and there it goes, does the time effect mushrooms have decreases like that too?
Thank you <3 it's always nice to find others who are going thru the same thing. I'm in 5he same boat with the highs there. My body has been used to 4-500s for so long that anything in the 100s has me almost comatose. But I've been working closely with doctors and writing literally everything down to try to get it under control. I'm not much for advise but if you ever wanna rant or vent I'm always here ^.^
I kicked coffee and that alone helped quite a bit. Which is saddening, since I love coffee, but I need to lay it off for a bit. I've drank a *ton* of decaf tea as a substitute in the last week or so, though! A single late-night beer while I watch something chill also helps me relax, but I'm not doing that very often. Everyone's got their own triggers and aids, it seems.

Thank you and, yes, she is amazing and I‚Äôm very lucky to have her. I have been taking a low dose daily medication for it and it has been better as of late, though still not ‚Äúnormal‚Äù but I should probably realize ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for me is probably not what it used to be. At least I‚Äôve been able to get back out running!
"A mantra was what helped me the most. Might work for you. For me having a mantra i recite during an attack started to help me especially once i talked with my mom about having panic attacks for the first time. She dealt with panic attacks too, so she kinda understood what i was going through. And one of the most stupid simple things she told me back then was: ""You dont die that easily!""

Yeah, i know, you can talk yourself into believing thats not true, especially since of course there are cases where people died that easy. But the chance of suddenly dying for no real cause is very very very slim. So i forced myself into saying: ""yeah, she is right, you dont die that easily"" I started reciting that sentence during attacks over and over ""you dont die that easily!"", and it really helped me. It took a while, but the more i started to recite the mantra the more i actually took it to heart and believed it. And the more i believed it, the more it subdued the attacks. Dont get me wrong, i cant control every attack easily, and it is still a rather monumental task to calm myself down, some attacks it takes longer. But without mantra i would just be completely helpless."
Yeah, I‚Äôve been dealing with them for 12 years now. It‚Äôs definitely gotten a lot better, but once in a while, my friend anxiety sucker punches me in the nuts to remind me we‚Äôre still pals, lol.
Yeah, it‚Äôs nuts. I actually take a different approach where I actually egg it on and do it‚Äôs worst. There‚Äôs this thing I learned from the Panic Away program where you do a countdown, and give the attack like 10 sec to do its worst. It‚Äôs just part of it tho, you‚Äôd have to read the whole thing to understand.
"It could be a mixture of things. It‚Äôs different when an event happens that causes the anxiety (e.g. ‚Äútook psychedelic drugs‚Äù), because once the event is over, the anxiety is gone and doesn‚Äôt come back until the next event. You know what caused it, and you know once your drugs wear off, or whatever stimuli caused it goes away, the anxiety will go away. 

Now imagine sitting in your office at work, minding your business. You‚Äôre working away, killing it actually, and BAM you suddenly don‚Äôt feel well, you‚Äôre hot and sweating, heart is racing, throat tight, visual distortions, body tingling....all for no reason‚Äînever felt something like this before. Your mind starts racing wondering what it must be. ‚ÄúDid I eat something? Is there something wrong with me? Why do I feel this way? Do I need to go to the hospital? Am I going crazy? Do I tell someone?‚Äù And this is just a few of the thoughts that come to mind. 

For many, yeah...it‚Äôs the fear of suddenly dying for no exact reason. Then you start having fear of another panic attach, and it becomes a vicious cycle."
"I get this way during PMS. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much water I drink or how many cucumbers/broccoli/salads I eat, my body is pulling all the water from my intestines and dumping it in my face, fingers, and feet and turning my poop into concrete. Oh, and then because I have to take muscle relaxers to stay upright at work once the bleeding starts, this further exacerbates the constipation. Sometimes the max dose of max strength laxatives aren‚Äôt enough to knock the poop loose, and I have to go in with an enema. 

I don‚Äôt generally recommend being a woman."
I got more of this when I fixed my diet tbh. Less McDonald's and more veggies and fibres made my poops less cooperative
"Then you get the runner shits on lap 4 but you really have to pass because God forbid you're going on FEP. So you start running faster so you don't turn your pt shorts brown but wait now you're running faster and oh God you're out of breath and then you finally cross the line, a sad pile of flesh. Then you realize you're technically more healthy then the average American and become really disgusted with everything. 

At least that's my experiences."
"That's why you shouldn't ever ""eat back"" the calories. It's actually my biggest annoyance with people on the fitness forums using MFP and other apps - oh I walked for an hour so now my deficit is 200 kcal more! 

That plus poor measuring of portions and it ain't gonna work. The key is to pretend you didn't exercise at all and eat the right amount, and that's how exercise can be used for weightloss.

The other option is to actually keep eating back calories and gain muscle - it's much much easier to drop fat once you have muscles to increase your metabolism. Eating maintenance while gaining muscle (or even deliberately bulking) and then cutting is a standard practice for bodybuilding for a reason."
When I can get in the gym and do sprints 2x-3x a week (ex bball player) I can burn as many calories as I can eat. Training for a half marathon has the same effect.
Was watching this super fun and trashy show called Secret Eaters. One girl used to believe you can eat ANYTHING your want within an hour of working out as calories don't count then. She was wolfing down full cakes.
If you're actually doing an hour of intense cardio daily then you can eat as much as you want, I'm a distance runner and will run an hour on easy days and I'm eating 4,000 calories on a good day, people often underestimate how long/hard they are working and don't realize how important consistency is for exercise

For completely out of anything traditional try Fairy Tales for Unwanted Children, this is basically a dude reading out short* stories, he's up to over 100 episodes so far, only found out about it recently through Reddit, so once again, YMMV.

"I think the problem with BCS is that anybody who has seen BB has a preconception of where BCS is going and how quickly it's going to go there. So, when a whole season goes by and it feels like you've only moved baby steps towards its predetermined conclusion, that shit feels like it's dragging.

But, based on the most recent season, I'm not confident that anybody *really* knew where BCS was going. It seems to me more and more like a stone cold masterclass on misdirection. You go in expecting the show to be about the fall of Jimmy / Saul, but I'm almost positive now that it's about something else entirely. And that changes EVERYTHING about how you see it."

So glad you and your family are ok."
"I think you‚Äôre right. In hindsight, it was obvious that the doctors weren‚Äôt panicking and they explained that everything was quite normal. My brain started an internal avalanche of panic that I couldn‚Äôt get out of. It was a really strange experience (and unpleasant). But yes, you are correct, and thank you for explaining. 

Glad to hear your child was ok :) I hope they are still well."
I would be furious. I know he probably just wasn‚Äôt thinking, but he should have been. How are you not careful with your words around patients? If I‚Äôm honest with myself, I wouldn‚Äôt be mad so much as I‚Äôd be exhausted lol. I was exhausted at the time, and if I had another burst of panic like that, I would have fallen asleep right when the relief washed over me. Can‚Äôt believe the doctor did that to you. I‚Äôm thankful he wasn‚Äôt talking about your wife though. Hopefully the other person ended up ok.
This is actually really reassuring to hear for some reason. I'm terrified for the pain of active labor haha. This stupid pre-labor/early labor mishmash I've been suffering through has been bad enough!
The massaging the fundus SUCKED SO BAD. I actually slapped my nurse on the hands despite being warned it sucked by friends way before my c-section. It was only maybe a minute of that but goddamn it sucked. For 3 days I had it done to me until I was discharged. It was done twice a day and each time it did not get better despite being on percocet.
"I had one super painful pap. It was done by a nurse practitioner and she used 5 different speculum and kept pinching me on the inside. It was horrific! I called the office to complain later and my doctor took it very seriously because I have been through a lot. She was let go.

Anyway now I'm afraid of papsmears"
I had a tilted uterus, so the cervix didn't sit where it was supposed to. Every damn time I had a pap, the doctors would have to fish around trying to maneuver the cervix opening where they needed it. It hurt like hell.
I guess there could be incompetent medical staff doing them poorly or medical issues that cause them to be painful, but as a general rule Pap smears should not be painful. The worst ones I‚Äôve ever had could be described as ‚Äúmildly uncomfortable‚Äù. I‚Äôve never experienced pain during one.

It makes me so happy knowing there are others on this planet who don't want kids. I get so much shit from people when I tell them I'm getting a vasectomy soon. Like wtf?? My body, my choice."
Thank you for the feedback! I'm actually writing the sheet music for the series, too, and will upload them for people to play along with. I appreciate your time taken mate, and will consider your advices regarding the posting of my stuff. Enjoy your Sunday!
I‚Äôm at the lonely quiet part where treatment is complete and I only talk to my dr once a month. I‚Äôm kinda just like ‚Äúwtf did that really just happen?!?!‚Äù I never really had a choice- it was basically you start chemo tomorrow or you die next week. My genetics were unfavorable so that guaranteed the eventual stem cell transplant. I‚Äôve had 5-6 bone marrow biopsy‚Äôs and even more spinal taps. I spent 18 days in the ICU with multi organ failure, which was traumatic to say the least. I eat uncertainty and needles for breakfast, that shit doesn‚Äôt faze me at all anymore. Lol
"I have them too. Did help a great deal. Most helpful though was this dry needling and stretching, in both directions. Oh and rolling my foot out on a small black roll.   
I never thought it would go away, but it did. Same with epicondylitis, for two years. Same cure, dry needling, stretching, massages with a black roll and an arm bandage thingy.  
Fucking aging body."
"To each their own. 

I always found that the thigh material would ride up my thighs in an uncomfortable way so I just ditched it altogether."
"That‚Äôs strange, I don‚Äôt notice it at all. They feel like the silk of Jesus‚Äô shroud god damn it‚Äôs nice.

Curious: are you shaved down below? Wondering my pubes are sparing me pain"
Bruh you got a corkscrew penis or something? How tf is it getting out of your underwear and into your zipper
"Yeah, some are plain outrageous though. I got in a car accident and ""died"" in the ambulance, but was revived with the aed. This guy at my work tells people he's died like 4 times but just keeps coming back. He never tells us how. So i guess its up to you to decide."
"Yeah, you definitely do get used to it. I think the first one, not knowing it was going to be 45 minutes screwed me up real bad. Like, if you're expecting its a lot easier to persevere than if you're expecting 5 minutes like a CAT scan. 

Also its much nicer when your head is far from the magnets."
I get a yearly mri for my abdomen. There is one point where they use a certain frequency that causes my muscles to twitch and sometimes even feel like I get zapped. I once was falling a sleep due to the sound of the machine, and then bam, startled by the twitch/shock... Then they tell me through the mic: keep still, don't move...
I also fall asleep durings MRIs. It's so loud but the measured breathing I'm normally asked to do is really relaxing...
I just a warn them, at my annual MRI, that I have a small child and will probably use the time to take an amazing child-free nap. They think I'm joking until I am zonked out.
Oh that's a neat bit of tech. Wouldn't have worked for my first one where I was belly down, but excellent for ones where you're lying on your back.
No idea. My second MRI was at a MRI only facility, which was far more pleasant that the first one at the teaching hospital. They did give me status updates.
"Oh gosh, why? They were imaging breast tissue with you face down? Is it like a mammogram where they need compression? 

Face down MRI when not absolutely required seems cruel. Half tempted to post in askDocs to get a radiologist to explain."
Oh thank God. I'm pretty sure an MRI costs thousands of dollars. I'd be absolutely livid if I had to pay for their mistake, with zero diagnostic or health benefit to me.
Not a weirdo, some people like it! It‚Äôs actually one of the things that drug seekers go after according to many of my nurses. They get addicted to the rush of it.
"Thanks for your understanding! 
I really wish you all the best, I love your positive attitude, that‚Äôs the way to go! Huge respect for that!

Btw, as a fun fact kinda, I worked in a hospital once where they had a mirror equipment for the patients inside an MRI so the can look outside of the MRI, and behind it was a display with nature videos so patients can focus on that, maybe making it a bit easier to relax. But I think its quite costy since I have only seen it in one hospital. (I don‚Äôt really even know how the display is built safely on a technical basis in a room with a that high magnetic field)"
Eww, somebody go get a mop or something. There's motion all over the floor and it's beginning to reek.
"Bro be patient with the elderly and tech. We'll be like that some day too with future technology, and Karma really is a bitch.

I'm in high end tech and still haven't figured out Twitter."
"Fair enough. I go the other way and try to use cash as much as possible and then I only keep 10s or larger and everything else goes in a ""forget about this until sometime in the middle of the year/December ish and buy some cool shit"" fund. Lol"
"You realize I‚Äôm not the same person you originally replied to right?

Yes I definitely get angry over it, I work at an animal hospital and a single minute can be the difference between life and death, so yeah - that‚Äôs a big deal."
why does it take that long to put change/a plastic card back into your wallet or purse? unless you're a grandma or have like MS it should take around 10-20s max?
Okay so I have an Mirena (hormonal IUD) and I haven't had any hormonal side effects at all.  From what I've read, the amounts are much smaller than other methods because it's super localized.  I had previously been on the pill and the ring, and both of those threw my hormones INSANELY out of whack.  I don't believe the copper IUD helps with periods (the idea being that the copper makes the uterine environment too acidic for anything to implant), but I haven't fully researched copper IUDs.  I got the Mirena partially because of the above side effects from other methods, but also because I was having incredibly painful periods, and a cyst at one point.  I've only had a few periods since I got it put in three years back, and they have been light and painless.  Insertion hurt A LOT, and while I'm not looking forward to getting it replaced in two years, I will absolutely be doing that when the time comes.  Happy to answer more questions if you have any.
"The copper IUD didn't influence my period pain, but they got MUCH heavier. The first ones on it actually got me worried from the amount of blood (like 3-4 days of one super absorbent tampon per hour ...) I actually bought a menstrual cup at that time because they have a bigger capacity. It got a bit better every month though, but still never got down to the level of my normal period.

My body reacted badly to it though. My uterus was in a constant state of heavy inflammation and it was swollen so I was really bloated. I gained some weight from the bodily stress that it created. So I got it removed.

I'm not saying this like ""it's bad don't try it"". I know two women who are super happy with theirs ! I honestly think that if your body reacts well to it, it's an amazing birth control method. It's rather a heads up so you know it's possible, because many doctors will tell you that without hormones there's no way it can make you gain weight. I researched after a year of having it in because I was going crazy not understanding why I kept putting on weight ... Had I known, I could have fixed it earlier üò¨"
"It‚Äôs literally just to prevent pregnancy. 
My doctor actually tried to talk me out of it because of the side effects. 

Weight gain, heavier or irregular periods, and it‚Äôs bigger so it‚Äôs more painful to put in. But it‚Äôs more effective, it lasts longer, and there‚Äôs no hormones. Honestly, if you really don‚Äôt want hormones, I would go with it. Otherwise do a different iud. I puked after having it inserted because it hurt so bad for me"
"Every body responds differently! You're likely to find more horror stories than positive if you search online because nobody wants to share ""yeah it's fine."" Getting my mirena inserted hurt like a bitch, but by the next day I felt okay. I didn't have monthly bleeding anymore (but stressful times did cause me to spot. A few months after getting it, graduating college/new career/moving to a new place way far from home had me bleeding for like a month. Never enough to need a tampon, just enough to be an annoyance, and TBH it may have just been my body still getting used to the hormones) but that was the worst of it in 5 years. No babies, no pain. Then like a month shy of the 5 year mark I started having cysts rupture and it was wicked painful (though unrelated to the IUD), I thought the IUD perforated my uterus or some shit. Went ahead and got it removed because I was ready for kids. Good news for that too, you may be fertile right away!"
I did Nexaplon, which wasn‚Äôt to bad. They insert it into your arm. Actual insertion didn‚Äôt hurt at all, but I had a large bruise for maybe a week. My periods have virtually stopped, just slight spotting once a month for a couple days. But the doctor warned me that some people actually have heavier more painful periods. It all just depends on your body.
"Im a teen, when i turned 18 i got the kyleena placed. It's a bit smaller so it (apparently) hurt less to be put in. Ive never had children so of course my cervix had never expanded that far before, and it hurt like hell but months later and im completely fine. My periods are a bit shorter now and slightly less blood but its barely noticeable. Also, I used to have lower back cramps but now they feel like they're solely in my pp area, if i even have any. The thing with an iud is that you just have to do it.

The reason i decided to go with a hormonal iud instead of the copper one is because after doing a lot of research the general consensus was that the hormones stay in your pp, so you shouldn't be all out of wack.

Another reason was that I used to PMS and thanks to happy hormones I don't anymore.

I hope that was helpful"
"I have a copper IUD. I have never had any period pain and a generally light flow and now my periods are very painful and much much heavier. From what I understand, that‚Äôs pretty common and it does not help your period get better. 

If your issues are hormone related, it could help! And I am happy to have mine. The first one I got actually fell out and I had another reinserted that has been going strong for a year now."
I don‚Äôt mind questions at all. My periods were lighter on the copper IUD but I don‚Äôt know if that was age or what so I think it may be anecdotal. I went with the copper in order to avoid any issues with my meds. Just in case I am impacted by the hormones, I don‚Äôt want up need a removal so I went with the copper. It also lasts longer so that was another big benefit for me.
I just had my third Mirena implanted, with the exception of minimal random spotting, I haven‚Äôt had a period in 10 years on it. I actually got more hormonal affects when my IUD began to age- right before I got my new one. I highly recommend. My friend got the copper iud and her periods and associated symptoms have gotten heavier/ worse. It‚Äôs just going to depend on if you want to use hormones (iirc it‚Äôs progestin). Removal and insertion can be painful- as you will cramp up, but it doesn‚Äôt last- take some ibuprofen or Tylenol before and it helps. A warm compress after helps too.
"Anecdotal, my wife got a copper IUD like 5 years ago. She said insertion wise, she had major cramps for like 10-15 minutes after, but then otherwise was fine. I've heard a lot of people talking about heavier or more painful periods. In her case, they were already really bad and irregular, but they seemed to get more regular and consistent day to day with the copper IUD. IE, she went from like 8 weeks with no period and then a 2-3 week long period that could go from spotting and no pain to heavy and extremely painful at any day throughout, to a pretty regular monthly cycle with a week long period that was fairly moderate flow and pain wise. She has PCOS though, so that may be related to why her experience was so different. 

I've heard a lot of good things about the hormonal version. It puts out way less hormones then the pill, and supposedly very little enters the bloodstream, so it's supposed to have fairly minimal hormonal side effects. However, everyone responds differently."
I've had the copper IUD for a bit less than a year. Right after I got it put in I experienced very heavy bleeding, along with some pain, for several days longer than my period would have lasted normally, but it was just that one time. The doctor told me to take ibuprofen for it. I think my periods have gotten slightly longer since I've had the IUD, but it's no big deal for me.
The only two side effects I had with Mirena that I did not with pill was mild cramps (only on day one) and acne - this is the worst. That painful unpoppable chin acne. However I will take it over the years I was horrendously irregular and nearly anemic due to how heavy a bleeder I was. My doc said that he was surprised I was still getting my period with it but then he looked back through my records and realized this was pretty much the equivalent of me not getting it in comparison to getting it a week before the placebo pills and bleeding for the remainder of the pack (so essentially two weeks on two weeks off).  At this point I‚Äôm not using it for pregnancy prevention anymore but it‚Äôs nice to know it‚Äôs there should I get into a relationship.
"I have 8/10 pain for periods and can‚Äôt move out of bed for a few days each month, but getting an IUD (Mirena) wasn‚Äôt too bad for me personally, though I hadn‚Äôt had anyone touch me down there before so I was panicky as shit. The tenaculum pain was 5/10, and the sounding and insertion didn‚Äôt hurt at all for me strangely. I took 800mg of ibuprofen before hand, and they didn‚Äôt give me any local anaesthetic. I threw up all over the floor afterwards though, bring a plastic bag or a bucket just in case. The night after it was inserted was like my normal 8/10 period cramps just less blood, but the next day was fine. It‚Äôs been a week now, and I‚Äôm on my first period with it inserted, and I can walk around instead of being doubled over in agony which is fucking wild. Still in pain but it‚Äôs manageable without pain killers, a 3/10. 

I may have just lucked out and had a good doctor, she talked me through it and had had 4 IUDs herself so was pretty understanding.

I hope it doesn‚Äôt fuck with my mental health, I am terrified of that happening as I was on the mini pill for a month when my mental health first took a turn for the worst (though I doubt it was just that that caused it) but the only way I‚Äôll know for sure if it‚Äôs gonna break me is if I wait"

I have paraguard (copper) and it made my craps and PMS much worse. I can't take hormones becuase I have brain aneurysms
I have the Mirena and had no side effects, despite going crazy on the pill. I would warn you, my friend got pregnant with my godson whilst on the copper one!
I have the copper IUD and at first it caused my periods to be heavier, cramps to be a little worse than before and I would have more spotting for longer after my period. But after 6 months of that I am completely back to the way my periods used to be and there haven't been any other side affects
I've had both twice. The Mirena I lost hair, couldn't lose weight no matter what I tried, lost my libido, chin hair multiplied, , crashed my estrogen level (had the level of a post-menopausal woman), gained weight, but my periods went down to just spotting every month. The copper: bloating, couldn't lose weight, heaviest periods of my life that lasted for 8 days, and I got pregnant with one of the copper ones (ended in miscarriage). I finally got the mirena removed last month after watching gobs of my hair fall out again. But, it really supports spontaneity and peace of mind in the bedroom! You won't know how it works for your body until you get it. Everyone is so unique. Good luck!
"Copper iud here! My periods are quite heavy and I must say now they just last 2 days extra - no additional period pain (never had actual pain though)

The actual procedure did not hurt at all! I felt something but it definitely was not pain, maybe thanks to the painkillers I took before upon docs recommendation. Additionally, I had to take some other meds the night before that helped a lot. I think they were muscle relaxants.

Anyway, I guess based on other comments, it really depends on the person how they react to it. I guess there is no way to know but i think a lot of times the fear just makes it worse! So maybe knowing that some people had absolutely no issues with it will make you feel better about it!"
"So I have the copper one. It does not help your period cramps in any way. Most people have a heavier one with the copper one. However, I do love having a cycle and not having to be on hormones. 

Having it inserted is one of, if not the, most painful experiences of my life though. As it turns out, my uterus is stiff and oddly positioned in my body (slanted up) - so that contributed to the pain in my case. I did take 4 Advil like advised. When I get it removed, I‚Äôm going to take an actual painkiller that I have leftover from something else. My periods have been about the same as they ever were. My cramps are probably worse then they were, but I was happy to trade all of that for no hormones. I‚Äôll probably do it again when I‚Äôm up for renewal if my partner doesn‚Äôt get snipped. Also, I‚Äôve never had kids, but I‚Äôve heard that helps reduce the pain on insertion."
i have the copper one going on 6-7 years, my periods definitely got heavier and they stayed heavy. i‚Äôd say if they‚Äôre painful now they‚Äôll get worse. the hormonal one might be a better bet honestly for you.
I have the Paragard IUD and my periods were heavy and lasted longer and were more frequent... for maybe 2, definitely more than 4 months? After that they went back to normal. I haven‚Äôt had any other side effects either. It‚Äôs been in for about a year now.
"I have Mirena because my NP said that copper might make my periods worse (which might mean I might have to ALSO be on oral BC and the hormones mess with my brain), and with Mirena I don't actually notice the hormones at all, no suicidal ideation or depression unlike oral BC I've taken in the past

Ninja edit: also no periods"
From a guys stand point I won‚Äôt have sex with a girl with one anymore that little fishing line in the right conditions is like a dagger and yea never ever again worst pain of my life
"They really are wrong about how it doesn't affect a person. I went into incredibly deep depression, full on suicidal around 4 days after insertion. Then I bled for months before it finally purged itself out. 

Best $300 I ever spent."
My bestie has the same results you did. She had a period for like two months. My periods were not more painful after the copper IUD. This is my third. I‚Äôve been using this method for 17 years.
The insane cramps lasted a couple weeks, but for months I would get a day or two of intense pain. Still worth it though
The copper one can make your bleeding worse. So it really depends... My gf chose Mirena, and it was the best choice for her. She almost don't have periods anymore (after 4 months). For us, it was totally worth it.
i wish i could get the copper, it‚Äôs so much longer lasting. but as an endometriosis sufferer, it‚Äôs just not an option for me. but i prefer localized hormones to oral ones, that much i definitely true. my cramps are hellacious even with help, like i‚Äôm sure an organ is rupturing horrible, so the copper would only exacerbate them and i can‚Äôt even imagine that.
"I get your point but what I really took away from that is that I'm just going to start calling parenting ""recovering pregnancy"". 
I.e., I love being an auntie; my sister has been recovering from pregnancy for almost three years."
"I got it in a few months after giving birth. My dr said it hurts so much before children because your cervix is closed, but after having babies it will never fully shut like that again. I‚Äôm sure the longer after giving birth the tighter it must become but my doc made it sound like it would be smooth sailing for reinsertion going forward.

Also, my son was 9lbs 8oz! Big babies are rough!"
I got mine replaced a couple of years ago. After the experience of getting it inserted the first time, I prepared for the worst, booked leave from work and asked my fianc√© to book leave too so he could come with me and take me home safely afterwards/look after me! But for me it was honestly fine. I cancelled my leave and was back at work that afternoon.  Maybe the skill of my doctor? I know everyone is different though and I feel so grateful that was the case for me!
Same.  I took ibuprofen before my first one (pre child) and I nearly vomited from the pain.  The second one (post childbirth), they gave me Norco and that took care of it nicely.
Also when I went and scheduled to get mine they told me to take a Tylenol beforehand. I only found out afterwards that Tylenol is NOT as effective as Advil. Oof.
Oh I agree completely.  It's absolute bullshit.  We don't *have* to be so scared of getting our birth control that we don't want to go through with it.  I was petrified (as it seems many folks are), but I decided that I disliked how the hormones in other methods messed with my head more than my aversion to pain.  I shouldn't have to settle for crying every day because I don't wanna hurt, especially when we have ways of making it better.  That's fucked.
"working in a pharmacy I'd occasionally see people get prescribed lorazapam (Ativan) along with the usual Misoprostol, but that was sooooo rare (some docs don't even do the Misoprostol). 

I'm low key avoiding going back to my gyno because she keeps trying to convince me to get an iud and even thinking about having one put in makes me woozy."
Okay so I just had mine removed and replaced without any anesthetic or preparation, and right before she started, I thought of this comment haha
To give the benefit of the doubt I don‚Äôt think YouTube allows 2 30 sec unskippable ads to happen at once but I still get what you mean.
Oh boy do I have a great trick for you. Sometimes, if you click the ‚Äúi‚Äù icon that shows on the ad it allows you to report the ad, which make the ad end for you, as well as any that were planned to play after in that particular instance (for example, if it were planning to play 2 ads back to back)
I cant believe they didnt learn from Facebook's obnoxious ads. Granted im usually more invested in youtubers, but if I have to wait through 2 ads to figure out if I want to watch a video from someone outside of the sphere of youtubers I'm already familiar with...nah it's not worth it. It just means I'm using your platform less than before.
Don forget the sponsor spots in every fucking video, so that even if you buy premium you still have to watch adds. Addblock+Sponsor block is honestly the best solution for pc and premium/Vanced is a decent enough for mobile.
"The only product I‚Äôve ever bought from an internet ad is deodorant - and it‚Äôs because I already bought the shit because I like the smell.

I watch a lot of YouTube, maybe 3 hours a day on average, and I‚Äôve never gotten one unskippable 30 second ad, let alone back to back.

"It feels like it‚Äôs overflowing because your teeth displace the mold and make it flood out.

They have to fill it up because that‚Äôs how they get a full mold and not ‚Äúmost of a mold‚Äù"
Oh yes! You just rest your chin, put on some specialty vest that protects you from the radiation of the x-rays and you‚Äôre done!
Sounds pretty cool and less gag-inducing. I had to get molded twice (top half fell apart after using it). Thanks for typing that all out üôè
Aw dude, that sounds rough. Luckily the expander fixed my underbite, so I shouldn‚Äôt need surgery. As for your random shooting pains, I have noticed my jaw will have days where it pops a bunch. It feels like a bunch of pressure builds up and when my jaw pops it releases with just a hint of pain. But hey, miles better than only having four of my teeth meet (true fact).
When I got my braces they showed imaged if you didn't take care of your teeth. Perfect squares of missing tooth.
"I have two sisters. I have every idea of what a nightmare dating some men can be and get how trust issues can arise. My point is that you should communicate your feelings. This wasn't manipulation, it was a yes or no. ""Want to go out sometime?"" 

Her saying nothing said more than anything I needed to hear."
well I think it's different when you're on an app where presumably everyone is looking for dates/sex vs a person you know in real life and are likely to see/interact with again.
I once played the risky game of writing my fantasy in a text to my crush, then accidentally sent it. I also got the ‚Äúwho‚Äôs this,‚Äù and also never responded. I‚Äôm glad to know I‚Äôm not alone.
This is true the person could be going through something. I think the important part to remember is that it never had anything to do with you.
"But I think it's important to remember that she's not rejecting him as a person. As a girl on Tinder, I got ""rejected"" or ghosted sometimes. But I always thought, maybe the person just broke up with someone and is not over them, or they're going through a hard time, or they're really pinning for someone who may not be interested, or they're in a relationship but need some affirmation or they're extremely shy, not ready. Maybe I'm just making myself fell better, but no one is better than me and I'm not better than anyone else. We're just at different points on our paths in life sometimes. And sometimes our paths cross and sometimes they don't.

It's never about you, because someone who has known you for a few texts and sees your picture, or has gone on a few dates with you, has not seen all the gems you have inside, or all that you have been through, all the things that make you be the only you on earth."
It just means they've seen your text, but haven't responded. Most messenger apps have symbols next to the message for it. Whatsapp and Twitter e.g. have a blue checkmark below the text that indicates whether the other person have seen it.
"It is easier, when girls get responses from toxic and even dangerous men so often.


I knew it happened but I had no idea how much until I had female friends point it out. For many of them it was daily, or multiple times a day, men approaching them online or on the street, hitting on them and then BLOWING UP when they got rejected. 


If something you did made another person threaten and insult you and it happened all the time, you‚Äôd avoid it. That‚Äôs the place they‚Äôve been put and why I always ALWAYS put the assumption of blame onto the toxic males we enable with our silence and displacement. 


I mean, some people suck but percentage wise it‚Äôs more often this example."
I have no doubt that is the case, and I honestly don't hold it against her. I'm just saying it hurts to be left on read.
"Oh believe me, I'm not scathing mad at her or anything. Hell, if I saw her again, I'd probably just crack a joke about it. ""Wow, way to leave me on read after pouring my heart out.""

It just went to show it wouldn't work out for us because she can't communicate on my level."
Set your expectations: don't expect messages back from girls on dating apps. That way, if you do get messaged, you'll be pleasantly surprised!
No need. It's not like I'm head over heels for her, I was interested in learning more about her. She didn't want to share. Oh well.
"I mean, it makes sense to me.  It's a considerably higher risk for women to commit to having sex than for men.  They can get pregnant, which, best case scenario, will result in taking care of a child.  The worst case is death from complications with pregnancy, which was way more common before modern medicine.  The risk being so one sided means they are more discerning, which leaves the males to do the chasing.

It's gotten a bit more balanced with the advent of modern medicine, birth control, and the acceptance of them in the workplace.  But it's still pretty one sided.  Add the fact that males are usually much bigger and stronger, even going on a date is risky."
I'm not saying it was her intention to be a jerk. I'm just saying that flat out rejection is better than to let someone stew in their thoughts.
I dunno about you fam but there are sometimes I literally don't check my messages for a couple days straight
sadly if you don't get a response from me there's a chance 12 hours later i haven't seen it. i don't live in my phone and i work a lot of hours. plus when i'm dealing with a lot i withdraw. at one point i had 35 unopened texts.
With my group of friends if I don't get a response for 1-3 days, I assume they're in the backcountry somewhere. If I don't get a response for 1-3 WEEKS I assume they are dead in the backcountry somewhere. So there's no such thing in my world as too late to respond. But if they're updating their instagram and not responding? RUDE.
"I had a friend who would not respond to texts for like two days and respond ""Sorry, I was asleep"". It was his meds apparently but for a while I thought the kid was a huge jerk :|"
Honestly I‚Äôll see a text, tell myself I‚Äôll respond in a minute, and then completely forget about it so idek if that‚Äôs true
I asked a girl I was talking to out, once. She didn‚Äôt respond, but it still said she was online. Luckily, she responded the following day. She‚Äôd fallen asleep and said she wanted to go. It wasn‚Äôt until a couple of months later that she did start pulling this shit.
It‚Äôs just useful for letting someone know you read something. If they text ‚Äúhey I‚Äôll be there in 5‚Äù I don‚Äôt have to respond ‚Äúgreat!!!‚Äù, I can just open the message and they know I‚Äôll be ready. It‚Äôs honestly just a shortcut for responding in the right situation. Plus I enjoy others having read receipts, so I keep mine on.
I agree, getting some kind of feedback (even if it's a harsh truth) is useful so you know whether you fucked up in some way that you can avoid in the future or if it's just the other person's problem
"""Not knowing where you stand is painful.""

This was a common feeling for me growing up. Eventually I just had to have self confidence. Which is what most people told me. Unfortunately they didn't actually describe to me how to get it. So I just decided eventually to not care and let things be how they were. I was tired of putting in work and not having it reciprocated. 

I just basically joked around and gave everyone and myself crap to make the situation easy on myself and get past it. Eventually it made me more confident as I got to know more people and they liked my attitude. 

Now? I realize when someone is being disrespectful, is busy, thinks themselves to be above me, etc. I will drop them if I feel like they're not worth my time. I have a life to live, and at the end of the day, I just have to go forward with my life without wasting my time or energy on others who are a waste of time or energy, intentional or not."
"Yes, you don't know EXACTLY where you stand, but you have a pretty good idea, imo. But, do you really need to know that perfectly where you are? Do you ever really know those kind of things for sure?

I think you just need to relax, think about it, but not too much, and continue with your life. If you want to text again, do it, don't over think it."
"Or they saw your message but didn't know how to respond or they read it at a stop light and are driving. 

Too many possibilities"
Yeah. Like what if they were kidnapped and couldn't  get to their phone. You would be none the wiser. and probably think she don't  like you. But she would probably hope that you question whether or not she is missing
It's funny to think about how, in some ways, the invention of instant communication technology has resulted in the opposite outcome we might expect, adding a whole new ball game to the anxious overthinkers. Pretty much the only solution is trying not take it personally and moving on.

"It's funny that you say 'only $30' for a toothbrush.  
Here in Uruguay if a toothbrush was $30 we would have the worst teeth in the world.

"Seconded, I would be eating myself during the first few sentences, so hearing that first thing would relieve all the pressure at once. 

You're a good person, doc."
Well that certainly is one way to stop it. And thanks for making it more fun and ending quicker for other people!
Ha thanks a lot. I‚Äôve actually started doing standup the last few years cause my friends said the same thing.
It started raining so I bought a $5 dollar hat or whatever the euro equivalent was. That woulda been the last extra piece I could spare before an all out poop apocalypse.
That's why things like hot pockets and pot pies say let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after cooking. Let the heat circulate.
The remedy for this is to cook the food at a lower power setting in your microwave. It adjusts how long the periods between which the magnetron remains off.
If This Then That might be able to do it somehow, but that's a bit of a stretch that I'm not sure about and you'd have to have a device like a Fitbit that can monitor your heart rate. There's also some apps that allow automated tasks that may support it

Isn't this why it's better to do your first trip with someone knowledgable and experienced."
Not the person you were responding to but for me it hasn't really. Each trip is a new experience and at least for me no two trips really feel the same. So that definitely contributes to it.
"Dr. Richard Bernstein is who completely changed my life. Like I said, I still mess up and eat stuff I‚Äôm not supposed to (in small quantities for the most part), but he‚Äôs got it figured out. I bought two copies of his book and subscribe to his YouTube channel. 

Little background; He is type 1 diabetic, in his 80‚Äôs, and healthier than an Olympic athlete. He was originally an engineer and practically on the brink of death before he started taking diabetes in his own hands. He figured out how to keep his blood sugar at 83 +/- 10. He wasn‚Äôt an M.D. at that point so no medical journals would publish his essays so he went to medical school to help other diabetics and obtain credibility. He‚Äôs had his own practice ever since and updates his book often. The man is the real deal, and I‚Äôm not quite on his level yet but I‚Äôm getting there. You should check him out on YouTube and talk to your doctors if you want to give it a shot. 

I always tell people, give it 2 or 3 months and just see how you feel. If nothings changed then you can go back to whatever you were doing before and you would have neither lost or gained anything. If it tells you anything, my blood sugar would regularly get 400 and above. When I was diagnosed it was over 600 at the hospital. I cannot stress enough that I‚Äôve been slippin over the past year, but the highest I‚Äôve been in the past 2 years was low 300‚Äôs. Which is awful, but I used to say ‚ÄúAh shit it‚Äôs not that bad!‚Äù back in the day. Sorry for the long comment, but man, if I could help just one other Type 1 get on track to living a somewhat normal life I‚Äôd feel like I‚Äôve done some good."
Ugh, I need to do the same and try to go without caffeine/coffee to see if it helps my anxiety, it‚Äôs just so hard.
Oh the talk show? That was extremely tense as well and I was honestly really close to having one there too because I saw some leaked parts of the scene beforehand, and to see it finally play out on screen just made it even more intense. I still go yeah. It only really happens to me in a cinema when I've seen a really intense part of the movie BEFORE I go to see it in the cinema, like if I've seen it online already. There's something about me knowing that I'm likely the only person in my audience who knows exactly what's about to happen that just sends my heart into overdrive. From now on I'm absolutely not doing that ever again
Hey bud, spent the whole day having them yesterday. You're not alone in this, stay strong and stay safe, I love you
I've heard that's common :/ thankfully it only sliced mine by about 25% I'd say heh...maybe 50%. It is noticeable.
Every day I try to be thankful that my body doesn't bleed and cause random intestinal issues/emotional turmoil once a month. Don't appreciate the early balding, but still not that bad in comparison

Used to have the same issues, but I am telling ya that thing works. Not the juice, but either sun dried or fresh ones. 

Seriously."
When I was pregnant with my daughter, I went hard on the Tums thanks to heartburn, got super backed up, and needed two suppositories to even get the process started. I was a couple hours away from just going to the ER and begging for help, but it finally broke loose and out burst a giant hell turd.
I typically get the period poops. Usually a full day of tummy grumbles and pressure. Cleans me right out but makes me feel extra disgusting in the nether regions.
ooh! add bowel cramps/contractions to the period poops! I get phantom period poops all the damn time when on my period. So. Much. Fun.
I get the same minus the muscle relaxers, but paracetamol and ibuprofen make it worse. Glycerine (or glycerol, not sure) suppositories are the best laxatives for me - 5 minutes and it's all out. Have you tried them? Also, I second eating dried plums/prunes.
A bag of [Sugar Free Gummy Bears](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/reviews/B00CMS97YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_mb_top?ie=UTF8) should see you right.
There's these pickles from a company called Sonoma Brinery. Most pickles are just cucumbers in vinegar. The ones from Sonoma Brinery are actually fermented like pickles ought to be. Eat two little slices and you will poop no matter what. And in the coming days you'll probably end up pooping your entire weight. These things are no joke.
Honestly, I‚Äôm not your doctor, but chances are that another method of treatment could resolve a lot of these issues.
My cramps were so intense that I opted to have a hysterectomy. It took time to convince my MD, but it was the best decision for me.
"> I don‚Äôt generally recommend being a woman.

See, now when I say this people get offended. But like, it's objectively worse right? You have periods AND you can't easily pee standing up. I mean society aside I feel like those are the most important differences and they both favor men."
Real talk, it‚Äôs probably because of a rapid switch, if you go from 10g of fiber a day to 40g, plus more protein, dear god, you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time for a couple days.  Eating this way increases ones water needs to an extant for regularity.  Honestly it is best to have balance and worry less about excluding certain foods and more about including the right foods.  That‚Äôs my *random internet diet advice*
"I don‚Äôt know about army or Air Force, but the Navy has sailors in the 17-19 age range run a mile and a half in 12 minutes and 15 seconds, 20-22 range in 13:15. I forget what comes after that.

If you can run a lap around a track in 2 minutes, you‚Äôre on course to meet the minimum. Just do it 5 more times"
This is all information that makes sense to me, and I am aware of the truth to all of it but I‚Äôve never thought about it before. Thanks for the interesting info, and luckily I‚Äôm not a person who does that.
Actually tho you can eat or drink whatever you want and lose weight. The downsides to beer are, drinking calories just makes the deficit and staying full harder, alcohol is catabolic(bad for muscles), you may be an alcoholic. But you could still lose weight !

Yes!!! I watched all of what's out currently of BCS before I finished BB in its entirety, so I may be jaded, but I really believe that if one watches it as its own show and doesn't think about BB too much, than they will be able to get into it. It's totally its own show, anything from BB has hardly anything to do with any of the show. So, like you said, a lot of people who already love BB go into BCS with a preconceived notion about what's going to happen, when in actuality, Breaking Bad has little to nothing to do with the main points of Better Call Saul.

The ironic thing is that I already owned a (non-MRI-compatible) pair of those glasses, and they were indirectly responsible for me needing the #@$&%* scan in the first place. I'd been working out at home, and those glasses let me do bench presses while watching TV. Problem is, they make it easy to zone out if the TV is at all engrossing; so at one point I realized I'd done maybe 40 or 50 reps without pause, damaging a tendon. :("

Why is the animal clinic prioritizing customers at the register at times where you have animals where a minute can literally change everything?

I'm thinking of getting this done soon as well, I'm just wondering how long the pain lasted for you after insertion? And was it like period pain or worse?
"Mirena puts out roughly 20mcg of hormones a day, compared to a starting dose around 30mcg on average for oral contraceptives (though some ultra low dose versions can go as low as 10mcg). From my understanding, the hormones generally stay within the uterus as well, so you tend to have less of a full-body response to them compared to the pill.

Also just to round it out for the copper IUD, in addition to the slight acidity the copper ions also break down sperm, cause an inflammatory/immune response that also attacks sperm, and thickens cervical mucus to help prevent sperm from getting in. It's super effective, but the side effects from how it works can make it less ideal than other methods for many women."
"This is a very common belief, but it's not correct.

The hormone is in your blood, it doesn't just work locally. The physical body of the Mirena works in a ""local"" way, but the hormones are body wide.

Also, research has shown that the absorbed daily dose is between 10 and 40 micrograms. That's anywhere from half the daily dose of progesterone only pills (minipills) up to DOUBLE that dose. 

I assume the women that absorb more on a daily basis have more problems with side effects.

The Mirena fucked me up in multiple ways. But it worked great for my best friend."
I had A Lot of hormonal side.effects from the Morena whereas I don't get any from the pill. Fwiw I think it just depends on your body.
I had the copper coil for 5 years, insertion was awful, I was in a lot of pain for a few days but then was fine. Had regular periods with it. Then I moved onto the mirena, done at my local doctors with a nurse I knew. I didn't feel the old one come out AT ALL, I was amazed when she said it was out. Insertion hurt a little bit, kinda sharp for about 5 seconds, then I went for lunch with my friend. No pain afterwards, and no period in 2 years so far. I absolutely love it. I was very nervous the first time, and at a place I didn't know well. Second time was amazing, because I felt much more comfortable in a place I knew.
Yeah one of my fears is weight gain because I'm trying to recover from anorexia, so I want to stay away from birth controls with that as a main side effect. Thanks so much for answering my questions, it was really helpful.
That's actually the only birth control I've tried and unfortunately it didn't work for me. The emotional side effects were too much and it didn't change my period at all, which I was hoping for because they can be pretty painful and they used to be really irregular, but now I'm on a steady schedule.
My god, I'm reading through this thread because I've had the Nexplanon arm implant for a year and a half and ive not had a day off my period since and sex has become too painful to even try, and I wanted to see how the alternative birth control may affect me, I just want to say I'm extremely jealous of you because the Dr that did mine must not have used the numbing right because I felt *everything* and I now need to get it removed most likely by the same doctor
I‚Äôve had to have mine removed because it moved and kind of half slipped out. How did the reinsertion work for you? My gyn is trying to push me in direction hormones, but I really want to stay hormone free. I. Just worried if I get another copper iud it will have to be removed again...
Thank you!! I'll definitely check her videos out. All of the comments are helpful in me deciding what's right for me, but am actual doctor's info before actually going to the gyno will be extra helpful. I know everyone is soooo different and every BC affects everyone differently, but the comments I've seen have been really helpful so far.
That's what I'm leaning towards based on everyone's responses. Thanks for the hornet feedback!! I won't make a decision solely based on the advice of people on the internet, but the feedback is helpful.
My depression worsened as well. Wasn‚Äôt as bad as when I tried Depo Provera in my 20s (I was on that for a year and it was great birth control because your sex drive disappears when your mood is always frighteningly low. When it finally worked its way out of my system, I was a different person.) Hormones, man ... some of us are just way more sensitive.
"I can‚Äôt remember if my period disappeared or what happened, I was thinking it hadn‚Äôt changed but in retrospect I think it went haywire. I got terrible depression, migraines, cystic acne on my back (I was 36 and hadn‚Äôt had acne since I was a teenager so there was no other explanation), and I had a harder time controlling my weight (I had lost a lot of weight and suddenly I just couldn‚Äôt seem to keep it off.) My doctor said most people don‚Äôt have side effects like mine but she agreed that they were too coincidental with when I got it in. Everything got better within 2 months of getting it out, and my SIL told me I‚Äôd probably fare better with a copper one (but when I got the mirena out I was in a serious relationship with a guy who got snipped, so I never had to think about birth control again while we were together).

Edit: I realized a few things I forgot and added them. :)"
"Yeah, huge babies are ... something! He was almost 23‚Äù long, too, and I‚Äôm on the shorter side so when he came out my sister was in shock. (My other sister had a baby almost the exact same size but she‚Äôs 7‚Äù taller than me.)

He had all these itty bitty newborn clothes that people gave us , that got returned as soon as we made our first venture to Target. Straight to 1-3 month clothes and those didn‚Äôt last long. He also spent his first couple days in the NICU (meconium‚Äî>collapsed lung) and I felt like an asshole with my enormous baby when all these other moms had these 3 lb. preemies they couldn‚Äôt hold. üòï"
"As painful as the insertion was and as terrible as the first 6 months were (pretty consistent bleeding and heavy cramping - my doctor convinced me to wait it out) I‚Äôm so thankful for it! 

I‚Äôm on my second IUD (mirena) now and haven‚Äôt had a period in 7 years... the removal and new insertion was worse than the first one, but I‚Äôll absolutely get another one when my 5 years is up again!"
"Okay so I just had to get mine switched, and it wasn't as bad as I remember.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful. The kicker was that I didn't have any medication at all (my doc gave something that I took beforehand last time that made a cervix a little more pliable), and they weren't even sure that they could get the new one in.

If you want one, you shouldn't let the fear of pain stop you.  Bodies are resilient, and it hurts in the moment, but it's SO worth it.  I didn't hesitate when she asked me if I wanted to get it replaced.  Also, they offered me a hot compress to hold while they did the procedure, and I liked having something to help."
They *can* chose but YouTube heavily recommends they use their algorithm to determine how many and where those ads are.

"And their point is not that asking her out was manipulative, it‚Äôs that once she said no you might have said ‚Äúwhatever you stupid fat cunt, you‚Äôre not hot enough for me anyway.‚Äù Or ‚Äúmaybe when I kill my self and put your name in my suicide note all our mutual friends will know what a bitch you are‚Äù and sometimes women just don‚Äôt want to deal with that. Or maybe you‚Äôd have pulled up to her place of work and caused a scene. Or her house with a gun. Now, I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôd have done any of these things but she can‚Äôt know that and many women have had *very* bad experiences with rejecting people that range from embarrassing to scary. 

She‚Äôs someone you knew irl on top of it so a poor reaction could have caused real damage to her social life. Or it made her feel awkward because she saw you as a friend and now she feels as you‚Äôre trying to hook up with her and that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs good for. Or she didn‚Äôt know how to respond in a way that would elicit a poor reaction. Maybe she‚Äôs just a bad person, maybe not. The point is that this situation has many ways it could have gone poorly for her and maybe just writing her off as some shit person if she was otherwise not bad to you is taking it a step too far."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that you asking her out was manipulative: I meant to say that she's probably had experiences where guys *became* super manipulative trying to turn a ""no"" into a pity date and wants to avoid experiencing that again by not issuing a definitive rejection.

But yeah, on multiple occasions I've gotten completely ignored after asking a girl out and it sucks. It's kinda understandable if we don't know each other well since she really doesn't have a way of knowing whether I'm actually a nice person or a ""nice guy"" waiting to turn into a rage monster if I'm rejected, and I don't really blame girls for playing it safe. But there've been times where it's been someone I've known for years, and it's pretty insulting to not even get a ""no thanks"" or ""let's just stay friends."""
Then why waste that worth, though that just sounds cocky, on that if you truly are high value then it shouldn't be difficult getting a decent gf, or girls in general.
As you can see, she clearly doesn't know you too well as a person, which explains why you're better off without her
Of course. I wasn't saying that he's not good enough. Everyone is good enough and different in their own way. People who aren't meant to stay are simply experience and there is no way to say he doesn't have the right to be angry at her. Even though she has her own reasons, everyone should own up to their own emotions to better vent it rather than trying to keep it all together. Some things are just confusing and better not happen for a reason
Well that makes perfect sense. So is there a way for a guy to avoid no response? Such as saying something like *whatever you would say to ask her out* then after that say ‚Äúwould you like to do that?‚Äù Or something along those lines. Idk it‚Äôs been a minute. I guess what I am saying is I have had both situations happen. If they ghost I will send maybe one more ‚Äúhey‚Äù text if nothing I‚Äôm gone. But I have had someone straight up say no thank you though, so I responded ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all right thanks for being so nice.‚Äù Nothing after. Once I had someone respond with something like she didn‚Äôt want to, then right after an ESSAY of all the reasons, we dated 2 years, fantastic girl to this day we are still in touch. Anyway I digress I am just confused as a lot of guys are as to how to make this situation better so less girls feel like no response is the best response?

I think the problem-causer here is the world that has trapped women in a ‚Äúdamned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt‚Äù corner where inaction is often the safest choice.


We could say, ‚Äúthat thirty seconds waiting to find out if the girl I like has been messed up so much by the world we live in that she‚Äôs put up walls I can‚Äôt climb because she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt owe my feelings anything.‚Äù"
"> it's just frustrating and immature

Of course it was.  Her lack of response was rude.  It takes a lot of guts to ask someone out, because you're opening yourself up to rejection.  It also takes guts to turn someone down respectfully.  In your case, she didn't have the courage to give you a direct answer.  Don't let that discourage you, keep on doing your thing."
I set those expectations a while ago my friend, just pointing out that it happens to a lot of us guys.
"You know what, you are 100% correct. 



I would say though that of the few that do message back, 95% of them just stop replying after a day or so. This is my experience of course and may vary, obviously."
ah so let me guess men have to demonstrate value because they chase, but women don't? is that what you are saying?
"so basically we're the bad guys? i didn't even mentioned sex as if that's all men are, which we are not, the point is society made us believe men should treat women right but NEVER have i ever heard people say men should be treat right.
Idk but stinks of discrimination."
"Same here, I go days/weeks without checking FB, insta or messenger as I sometimes just don't have the mental energy to be dealing with people all the time.. I still meet up with friends and try to pick up calls, but social media is honestly tiring and meaningless often.  
It's also a very common trait of depression, so if you have friends like me who don't reply and seem to isolate, please call them and check/meet up."
"I feel you and then I'll want to reply but then replying after so long looks kinda rude so I just let it be there

Edit : I was talking about the random texts which makes up only small talks. That is the kind of texts that I forget to reply and just let hang. I don't know if that counts as ghosting. But if someone texts some real shit or is really interested in talking with me and shows it, I would not once ignore their text. Thats just rude. But ignoring random small talks is something I do just because Im lazy and I wish ppl would stop taking that so personal."
Same especially with how things are currently. I'll also sometimes see that someone messaged me and just keep the notification there until I feel like reading and responding. Like you, sometimes that's days.
bruh you think 35 is bad? i‚Äôve known girls who literally had thousands. I really don‚Äôt get it. Having all those notifs sitting there just seems stressful as fuck.
I wish people would stop considering not responding to random texts so rude. I mean if its anything important then yeah not responding kinda is like not caring. But c'mon ppl if I didn't respond to some randim text you sent that doesn't mean I am rude I just don't find texting that interesting
You're the worst kind of person. When you see it, just fucking respond to it. E- LOL this triggered a lot of people. Relax. My remark is mostly tongue in cheek. If it's important then it warrants a timely response.
"Preciesely! The problem with that though is that not everybody is adult enough to accept they made a mistake, and will become insulted and angered at the person telling them the truth, which then makes the truth teller afraid and could prevent the truth teller from telling the truth in future. 

In conclusion, to the people who can't take constructive ciriticism, harsh truths or disappointing/upsetting news: grow up. learn to recognize your flaws and address them. Work on them. Also, don't be afraid to apologize when you make a mistake. We're all human, and the idea that sorrow/sadness/apologizing makes you weak is toxic and will only lead to arrogance and pain."
The problem with this is that no one owes anyone an explanation.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not interested.‚Äù is acceptable as an entire reason.  There‚Äôs also the white lies of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just really busy‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI just not ready for a relationship‚Äù etc which are basically the same thing
Do people not take time away from their phones anymore? I will not check my phone for 24hrs or more sometimes. So if they dont answer, maybe they havent seen it
Just curious. If you‚Äôre interested in someone and they don‚Äôt reciprocate that interest, do you categorize them as someone that thinks they are above you?  In other words, do you associate a character flaw in them in order to better handle the rejection?  Not judging either way, again, just curious.
No it's in KS, but it's based off a model of care from some NE State but don't remember which one haha but maybe it was Connecticut!
In the US, an electric toothbrush for $30 is quite cheap, but there are plenty of manual toothbrushes that are way cheaper, and i don‚Äôt know anyone personally who has an electric toothbrush. Maybe it‚Äôs common somewhere, but I don‚Äôt know those people.
"I suppose a good way to really work out the price, relative to your country would be to take the average American hourly wage and see how many hours they have to work to buy that toothbrush. 

Do the same for you country and then you can see how much more they pay. You have got me curious about cost of living. 

Take this as an example: I live in a town about 6 miles outside of Manchester, England. Things from shops will cost me more in the City center than they will in my hometown. 

Hours worked to buy an electric toothbrush UK ¬£30- average hourly pay in the UK ¬£14.80 (2019. should note the minimum wage is ¬£8.72). 

So in the UK someone earning the average wage is working 2 hours for that toothbrush and the minimum wage worker is working 3.4 hours. I‚Äôm somewhere in the middle of those figures so I guess is worked about 2.5 hours. 

Kinda puts things into perspective if I worked out how many hours something cost me. Kinda like the movie __In Time__"
Woah that‚Äôs crazy I never would of imagined toothbrushes could be expensive in other parts of the world.
"I'm in the usa and if I had 30 dollars it would all go towards food and baby supplies because I'm dirt poor.. if someone says ""only 30 dollars"" they have enough money they don't have to worry about survival"
It's normal in that plenty of other people have the same experience. I can't say whether it's *common*, but I wouldn't consider it abnormal either :)
Yep it‚Äôs a con, ask a dentist and it‚Äôs such a small amount really required not a huge lump on a brush!
Dope. I went searching because when I looked up my toothpaste type it says ‚Äúbrush teeth thoroughly and at least twice a day‚Äù and that was it but then others say the 1 inch thing.
It didn‚Äôt hurt my teeth. It made my tongue burn. I‚Äôve always been sensitive to intense mint flavors but some toothpastes actually cause pain so I‚Äôve found one that is less intense and don‚Äôt use a lot.
Love my quip for that reason. It‚Äôs also just really nice looking and light-weight. But as someone who always forgets to change their toothbrush head, it‚Äôs so nice when it just shows up.
This sounds like a box of luke warm, crusty hot pockets that you found in the back of your fridge and you have no choice but to eat it due to being poor.

"Could buy it from Amazon and then return it if you find you don't like it.  Just make sure you wear it properly so that the data is accurate.  I like that it tracks my sleep oxygen levels/sleep time/sleep phases, and it tracks stuff you never knew you wanted to know about, beyond steps and stairs.  It also has a ""where's my phone"" locator on it which has come in handy way too many times."
"Definitely a good reason to, yes. Psychedelics are very unpredictable, especially your first time. Being able to ""let go"" or ""embrace the chaos"" would be the biggest/best thing you can do for yourself to enjoy the experience of a trip or life in general."

Yea, it was a sad reality when I discovered that it helped, but definitely give it a try for at least 2 days in a row to see if you can tell any difference. I was initially getting caffeine-withdrawal headaches but those are gone now, thankfully. You can also try...\*gulp\*...*decaf coffee*. I know, I know...it's not the best solution, but it's one that may be a workable middle ground!
Yeah, that‚Äôs the one. I don‚Äôt know if it was the lack of background music or what it was but I found it really unpleasant. Oh, you‚Äôd think it would be less nerve-wracking if you‚Äôd already seen it? Interesting. Anyways, I think I‚Äôll stick to comedies for a while.
The curse of Adam. At least PMS is a hidden shame. The world always knows we are balding, though.

"This might get graphic, heads up.  The sounding was first.  They take a stick and poke the back of your uterus, and it feels really bad.  It was a strange pain, kind of like a deep cramp.  The insertion felt like I was burning along the insides of both my thighs, from lower abs to mid thigh.  It really REALLY hurt, and there was def some blood.  I was a little shaky after that, but the pain itself was sudden, and began to dissipate immediately after they took everything out.  I hung out in the chair for a few minutes, got up, put pants on, and left.  I walked home and spent the afternoon in bed-- more because I wanted to treat myself than because it hurt badly enough to warrant that.  By that evening, I was fine.  I biked to work and went to martial arts practice the next day, and there was no residual pain.  I had that pill that makes your cervix more pliable, so that might have made my experience better.

Tl;dr The moment of insertion hurt like a bitch, any pain after that was far less debilitating than the severe cramping that I experienced during a bad period.  And I haven't had period pain in 3 years, so cumulatively, it was far better."
"I have a mirena as well, for me it felt like bad period cramps afterwards, and faded slowly over the next 2-3 days. The worst bit was the insertion, after that it was duller.

ETA I also had constant bleeding for about three or four months straight after insertion, but once that stopped I didn‚Äôt have another period for three years."
"I had the Mirena. Prior to my appointment, I heard comments similar to the ones below, so I went in expecting horrific pain. It felt like a 15 second strong period cramp then it was over. I must have been lucky, but it was definitely not overwhelmingly painful. Not bad at all. 

Because I was expecting the worst, I had taken the day off. After my appointment I felt well enough to go to a nice restaurant and order the most delicious grilled cheese ever. It turned out to be a much better day than I expected. Here‚Äôs  hoping the same happens to you."
"I actually got mine about three days ago. When putting it in it just felt like really strong period cramps for a few seconds (which surprisingly made my body relax? Maybe I'm just weird lol) and I was given a hospital grade Tylenol. After 8 hours I felt some strong cramps, but it wasn't anything more than what I've felt before. It had been a few years since my cramps were actually painful, but still nothing major for me personally.

As of day three I have no cramps. The last few days I just took 1 ibuprofen and 1 acetaminophen whenever I needed it and haven't needed anything since yesterday. Obviously everyone is different, and I'm not saying getting insertion is a walk in the park, but it's more of a period cramp than sharp pain which I felt was easier to deal with.

Edit: I got the Mirena, not the copper. So I don't know if insertion is any different between the two but I assume not because they're done the same way"
"The pain, for me, was so excruciating that I swore twice and broke into a really bad sweat. It was like intense cramps plus someone inserting a super heavy rock that‚Äôs putting weight on your lower back. I was in pain for a few hours and had to have Christmas Eve dinner at my boyfriends parents house (thankfully they‚Äôre totally cool). I bled through my pants even with a panty liner. I haven‚Äôt had it in for a year yet but my cramps are bad if/when I get my period. I never know when my period is coming, but it‚Äôs pretty light. They say the cramping can last 8 months to a year.

Funny story about the ride home from the clinic....the cramping was so bad that I was in the fetal position in the passenger seat and I was white. My boyfriend started thinking about what they did to me and how much pain I was in. He suddenly got super bad sympathy pains and puked all over himself while driving down the highway. Now that‚Äôs love!

I got Mirena and I don‚Äôt regret getting it, I‚Äôm only dreading getting it removed or replaced in 4 years."
It's one of those things that different for everyone. I found it uncomfortable, but not painful. The first time I got one I had moderately bad cramps for about 36 hours after, but found a heating pad helped lots. Slightly worse than period pain. The second time getting it done the cramps only lasted about 12 hours and were very mild. I will absolutely be getting a third Mirena when this one expires.
This isn't quite the question you asked, but some doctors will give you the option of ibuprofen plus a pill that relaxes your cervix. I forget the name but it's also used for medical abortions. I would NOT recommend that extra pill. The cramps I experienced because of it were far worse than the recovery from the Mirena insertion. I didn't take the second pill the second time I had a Mirena installed and I was in much less pain afterwards.
Different person but for me I had maybe a week of what felt like weaker period cramps. Uncomfortable, but not unbearable.  I also bled a bit that week because I had it inserted while on my period, but no bleeding for over a year after that.
It's different for everyone. It's almost time for me to have my third Mirena put in. I had no pain at all with the previous two insertions. A little bit of discomfort during the actual procedure, but that's it. I spotted for a couple days, then nothing. I haven't had a period in almost a decade, and it's fabulous.
Understood.  Thanks for the clarification here. I imagine it works like hair dye-- some dyes take to different kinds of hair differently.  My favorite dye doesn't hold at all on my friend, while her professional dye comes right out of my hair.  Bodies are different, different medications will work (or not work) for some but not for others.
That makes all the difference. The doctor who was doing my procedure called in an np to hold my hand, and I was so grateful for that. I think getting the second is going to be easier than the first, and it's an absolute no brainer. It allows me to keep an extremely active lifestyle and not get dragged down by shifting hormones or period woes.
"Of course. 
A lot of resources (including Planned Parenthood) say the Copper doesn‚Äôt cause weight gain, so it could just be for a rare few, or my doctor could‚Äôve been wrong or I could‚Äôve misremembered. I personally have not experienced weight gain, but I‚Äôve experienced bloating, cramps, and heavier periods.

Good luck on your search :)"
"Same except mine went from super regular to irregular. I was military so i wanted something I wouldn‚Äôt have to take a friend every month to get (training is stupid). 

Turns out that would have been a much better situation for me. Live and learn I guess."
"Why the same doctor? Get someone else to do it if you can.

It also made sex super painful for me, and it took some mental coaching after to get it back. I was also in a super stressful time of my life.

I‚Äôm not trying to scare you but rather say if the first time after doesnt go well, it‚Äôs not your fault and try again! It‚Äôll come back!

Or it‚Äôll come back day one and this will have been a dumb post."
My doctor used a local anesthetic to numb my upper arm. I truly felt nothing. She waited until she could poke me arm and I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. If it hurt when they put it in they are doing something wrong. She also told me that if it negatively affected my period, there were medicines that could be used to try and correct that. Since that didn‚Äôt happen to me, I don‚Äôt know what they are. I just happen to live in a city with a world renowned hospital, so I get very good health care that is fully covered by my insurance because it‚Äôs the only local option.
"I was really concerned too. The first time I had it done it was by a physician‚Äôs assistant (not to say they‚Äôre not capable and great) and it came out. I decided to try again with a obgyn and it felt totally different. 

I have a tilted uterus that is also shorter than the IUD. This means it was difficult to place and is not quite fully seated (though it almost is). So far, after the more thorough reinsertion, it‚Äôs been great and has stayed in place. So fingers crossed! I know technically it‚Äôs more likely to come out if it‚Äôs happened once but I feel very strongly it wasn‚Äôt quite right in the first place and now it will stay in."
Wow, I‚Äôm so glad to hear it hurts less to have it out, because I‚Äôm definitely scared. Thanks for the info!
Oh man I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that, it must have been so scary for you. I‚Äôm glad everything ended up being ok!
I think they're up to 20 seconds now. I noticed the change recently when ads were suddenly seeming a bit longer. Sure enough they were up to 20 seconds.
Yep and I‚Äôve never even gotten back to back of those. If my first ad is 15 unskippable, it‚Äôs my only ad.
They overfill it because they need to get an accurate impression of the surrounding tissue. Perhaps it shouldn‚Äôt be a whole whopping inch, but the material is supposed to fill past the edge of the tray by a little bit.
It's been about a year. We have mutual friends, but I only see them every so often. I'm not too concerned. I would be civil.
Ideally, dating is the process of finding someone who I can see myself spending the rest of my life with. It's worth the effort to try, but not worth the effort to pursue if the interest isn't mutual.
"For fewer girls to think it‚Äôs safer not to respond: it would take a change of the whole culture.

When I encounter other men who are sexist, misogynist, believe in wrong ‚Äúfriendzone‚Äù garbage, or try to white-knight women I confront them. Men have to police men because 

1. Women often won‚Äôt do it without fear of retaliation by a cracked ego (and also plenty of women are EXHAUSTED by it; they don‚Äôt live just to correct men) and 

2. Sexists will only accept the perspective of men enough to even listen.

Because these type of men use a shotgun approach to women, catcalling every one they see and blowing up so extremely, they do more damage than any one person could repair. Humans imprint and remember the extreme examples that give the rest a bad name. From dating to ‚Äúblue/black lives matter‚Äù the opposition doesn‚Äôt see the general intentions they see the agitators. 
If there were easy solutions to that it would have been done but even a hard fix takes an effort from a lot more people than are willing to make one, at least for this generation.

In the long run, girls are people. Women will always be confusing because people will always be confusing. Just like all people they have feelings and hopes for themselves, they fear and are all different. There‚Äôs never going to be one answer or one approach that ‚Äúworks.‚Äù Swing too far towards The Tao of Steve approach and it becomes easier to ‚Äúscore‚Äù but a lot harder to hold onto anything, much less find anything meaningful.

The world is chaos and everyone in it. But if you are a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù or in the ‚Äúfriendzone‚Äù and aren‚Äôt actually being nice or a friend because you‚Äôre secretly thinking about what YOU want or need or fear: then you are NOT actually in those situations, you‚Äôre just a selfish asshole. 

Fake empathy isn‚Äôt any less a game than what the ‚Äúplayers‚Äù play, it‚Äôs just a sneaky and unsuccessful one."
"I was actually referencing It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

To honestly answer your question, based on your response, it sounds like you are projecting. You find yourself worthless and think that's why women aren't interested in dating you. I'm not trying to be mean, but you have to work on your own self image before you can even consider anyone else's. Be happy with yourself and you'll find that people are happy for you too. For real dude, good luck. I wish you the best"
I always wondered if I was a high functioning depressed person. I guess this kinda supports my suspicions.
"Don't instagram messages pop up right away though? (like any other I assume) I messaged someone for the first time a few days ago, they didn't respond and then after 10 hours or so I got self conscious and ended up ""unsending"" the message."
"Lately my luck in dating has been like that guy that got struck by lightning 3 times. I'm not even upset about being rejected (I served a 2 year lds proselytizing mission, I'm used to getting doors slammed in my face) but what's annoying is I'm not even getting rejected. I'm just getting ghosted. I'm totally chill with the girls I ask out, I guess it's just the trend. Instead of saying ""hey I just don't want to go out with you"" or whatever, they just don't respond. I'm not talking like a day or two. Like they're just done. Nothin. I absolutely hate it."
"Go ahead and reply. There are people I used to be friends with whom ghosted me over a year ago. I would love a response even now even if it's just a ""I don't want to be friends anymore"" as it provides closure."
"me too and then i decided that this whole social messanger bullshit is not for me. i deinstalled that shit. i am back to calling people. left on read? talking to a person solves that issue very fast.

"it is.. those were just the ones i didn't open. and it was people i had intentions of responding too ""when i had energy"" 

i dont even know how you can have thousands of messages. guess i'm not cool enough"
"They weren't random, I'll tell you that lol

Edit: Oh, but also yeah, you're totally right. Some people just don't look at their phones that much, or take longer to answer because they think for a while first. Both are valid"
"This also reminds me of a quote I saw 

"" I'm a really bad texter unless you are my bestfriend or I like you"" this is so me. I mean..this isn't about you. I'm not just the kind of person who keeps the chat going just for its sake and I dont mean to be rude either. 

I wish everyone would just get this"
Sometimes I don't have the energy for it and want to give the text the attention it deserves when I'm in the right mindset
You're the worst kind of person. Not everyone has sufficient mental/emotional energy to be chatting with people all the time.
I have other things going on in life and can't always respond immediately, maybe it is rude but if I didn't prioritize I would never get anything done.
"Depends on the text I think. If it's something like a question that needs an answer yeah, respond right away, but if it's more like a ""hey what's up"" I don't think there's an obligation to interact that way or keep responding."
Real newsymcnews for you: the brain's responses to intent and action are surprisingly similar, and ADHD is a hell of a drug.
"They're referring to a text being marked as ""Read"", so the recipient saw it, but chose not to respond."
"No, I don't believe they think they're above me. 

As for the other question, no I don't put a negative point of character on them to make myself feel better. Undoubtedly this could work for people, but I see this as being unhealthy, wrong, and potentially dangerous. 

If I actually know why someone rejected me, or rather specifically didn't talk to me because of something, I acknowledge it and move on. Because if someone has a problem with who I am, what I do, believe or don't believe, etc, then my time is best spent somewhere else or towards someone else where I can actually make progress or where I could find potential."
Sometimes people read a message and then forget it.  But I guess if they forgot it, it may not have been too important to them.
Pro tip: my female friend yesterday had 13 messages on snapchat non of which she knew about for over 3 hours. They don‚Äôt all ways they they phone. Hole that clears up some of the ambiguity moving forwards
I do have anxiety sometimes. I am human. But someone not replying to me is just sad, not a source of anxiety. For example, this girl, who's been (or was) my friend for some time, blocked me on whatsapp after we had something one night when she came to my house after a party. I was not expecting that, because it all went ok, I think so, I don't know. It doesn't make anxious, it is just disappointing and sad, but that's life.
In India, manual brushes are less than $1 and I have never seen anyone use a electric toothbrush in my entire life. I have started earning and was thinking to buy one but spending around $30 on a product for which I pay $1 feels way too luxurious. I don't even know if they're worth it or not
I found a 50 pack of those cheap pre pasted disposable toothbrushes for 10 bucks at Walmart, best deal in the world
I‚Äôm from Canada and everyone i know enough to know what toothbrush they have usually has a electric. If you spend 30-100 on a toothbrush it‚Äôs kind of like a investment you just will need to buy replacement tips and charge it. you teeth will be cleaner and probably help add a better brushing habit. Unless I‚Äôm wrong about it being majority and just happen to know people that buy electric ones more I think most people around GTA area have a electric that aren‚Äôt from the more sketchy areas (ex: Scarborough)
Thank you! Sounds incredible. I live alone for the first time and I loose my phone constantly. And I can‚Äôt ask anyone else to call it lol. Thank you
Definitely! I think I‚Äôll try doing decaf for at least a week and see what happens - think I‚Äôd really struggle if I stopped cold turkey; coffee is such a huge part of my morning routine, you know? My fear is the withdrawal headaches! Glad to hear it made a difference for you though :)
No I think it's worse when I've already seen it! Knowing exactly what's going to happen made it worse for me. Throughout that scene there was disturbing background music which then cut to silence and that happened several times, made the build-up really effective. The way that it felt so real didn't help lol
Feeling loved and desired should go both ways, but often doesn't. It's not a guarantee for women either.

I think this needs quoting just for the awesomeness of it."
It's generally a bad idea to assume that all vaginas have it easier based on their very vagina-ness. It's not true for all, only some, and they're shoved in your face by the social media apps we're all addicted to.
Yes, for me it's about 5 minutes, the pack says up to 30 minutes. They don't hurt at all. I get the laxative cramps with oral laxatives and they feel like periods too, so double whammy. Try the suppositories because they've never let me down. Make sure you get the correct ones and not the ones for piles. The laxative ones are like the consistency of jello.
One lap around a standard track is a quarter mile, so 6 laps makes a mile and a half; 12minutes/6laps=2 minutes per lap
Well, tbh this is my 3rd acc. I deleted my first 2 because they were not on my own email. But yeah! This is my first cake day on Reddit.
"What he's saying is that if those movies were released in 2020 they'd receive a PG-13 rating.  First and foremost, PG-13 was only invented in 1984, just a few months before the release of Terminator.  While Predator was released in '87, PG-13 wasn't exactly in-vogue yet at the time.  Second of all, the standards have changed pretty significantly.  Movies that are clearly PG-13 now such as The Social Network would have absolutely been rated R back in the 80s, considering its use of the word ""fuck"" and a sexual scene."
Oh man, my wife isn't interested in sex, better become a drug kingpin and destroy the lives of everyone I've ever known!
"So I honest-to-god tried watching the show twice. First 2 seasons. I really didn't like it. 

Gave up on it finally.

I've always been curious why does everyone like it so much. I'm gonna go look at Reddit reviews and get some sense of what makes it a great show that I don't have the eye for."
I'm trying to think of a stupider possible misinterpretation of Breaking Bad and the best I can come up with is blaming the divorce on Walt Jr., and even then I'm not sure how I'd make that case. Well done, if that's what you were going for.
Just because they‚Äôre married doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs entitled to her body. She‚Äôs just supposed to deal with getting her body used against her will repeatedly so that his ego doesn‚Äôt get an owie?
She was her own type of asshole for sure but I think leaving money for his family was walt‚Äôs biggest priority.
Wanting to be pregnant is the reason women get obsessed about all the little 'signs' - the body is ever so good at giving you false hope - and needing to take a test regularly 'just in case'.
Quiet, consistent workouts at the gym, time alone to build model kits and play video games, the ability to go to a tropical island and scuba dive whenever I want gives me much more joy than a kid could ever bring.
I am extremely claustrophobic and just told I need to get an MRI for my hip.  My friends said you only have to be in the tube up to your waist.  I think they are lying because you were totally in the tube for your wrist.  Why?  I have so much anxiety over MRI‚Äôs and appreciate your suggestion.
Oof, I always can only shake my head when I think about medical costs in the US. So sad, especially since it‚Äôs necessary.
Tell them to wait? I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôd be on the cashier at a time where you not helping the doctor could mean life or death for the animals if you take too long. Shouldn‚Äôt y‚Äôall be more concerned about the animals living then going help the customer during something like that?
This is prrtty much my experience too. From sounding through insertion, it's one of the worst pains I've ever experienced. I'm on my second, and the momentary pain is absolutely worth the 7 years of not having periods (which for me were occasional contenders for the runner up  to the worst pain experience).
"Ugh I just got my Mirena taken out to try for baby #2 and I miss not having my period SO MUCH. 

I will say as someone who has had one child, getting the IUD put in didn‚Äôt hurt me at all. I understand it‚Äôs different for everyone. Getting it out actually hurt worse!"
Where I live there's only one small clinic that will do it, my actual doctors don't do anything more than a blood test procedure wise, I'm going to see if I can request a different doctor at the clinic though. The implant has just been one big negative to be honest, I have managed to have sex a few times but it's really not sensual to be like woah wait a minute just like 2cm at a time please friend, I thought about the copper coil as it doesn't have hormones but now all I've read are horror stories so I'll just have to see how I go, thank you for your kind comment
They were very comforting. I was sort of scared when he didn‚Äôt cry, then they suctioned him, showed him to me (no holding) and took him straight to the NICU, but they reassured me as much as they could. Then I had a bunch of complications (couldn‚Äôt stop bleeding, ugh). Once I was stable a couple hours later and I got to see him, he was all happy and cute and they were like, ‚ÄúThis happens a lot, he‚Äôs really gonna be fine, just needs a little extra care‚Äù so I never really worried much. My then-husband and I saw a couple in there from our birthing class whose baby had come SO early and we realized right away we were pretty lucky for ours to have a very minor setback.
I get two unskippable 15 second ads all the time. Maybe their algorithm knows I'll tolerate it and hits me with extra.
This means so much to me that you followed up. I have some good news - i am in the process of joining a student organization where I will hopefully make some friends so that I have a support system at school. I‚Äôm not at my best but I‚Äôm trying to be grateful for the things I do have and looking forward to whatever the future may hold. I might study abroad so that I don‚Äôt have to be on campus much more. It‚Äôs nice to know a stranger out there is thinking of me. I hope you are doing well.
Was joke oops :flushed: I hope I haven‚Äôt fooled anyone into giving me upvotes... I‚Äôll edit my comment
"Very interesting points, 1st off legit thought provoking reply in the comments section of reddit, thank you. I genuinely agree with most of what you say other than maybe the ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù issue. I do strongly believe that you can send all the correct signals to a women, she flirts back sending similar signals, then you attempt to act on those signals and you find she wants to only be friends. Which, from a guy‚Äôs perspective is a huge letdown assuming it‚Äôs a legitimate emotional connection. What is my issue about ‚Äúfriend zone‚Äù is guys who believe it‚Äôs the girls fault after the initial rejection. That is wrong. But I see it all the time, these guys force a friendship because they want something more when it clearly isn‚Äôt there. They do immense amounts of damage to their ego and resentment towards that person builds. Sadly, if emotions are involved I do not believe it‚Äôs healthy to suppress unresolved feelings for someone to remain friends in the hopes that one day a real relationship will happen. That goes both ways girls need to realize this hard truth as well as guys. Friend zone type relationships lead only to negative consequences for both parties no matter whether good intentioned or not.

I really liked what you said about women not responding due to what you described as a very rational fear. I could totally see myself making that if I had an experience similar to that with a girl blowing up on me when I reject her. I can‚Äôt blame anyone for feeling like that. 

A total culture change is needed. I have more to say but my little brother just got engaged. But thanks for the answer very thoughtful and understandable."
"that's the thing! i have done that, of course my image isn't perfect yet, i have to work a bit on my skin problems (treatment almost finished) amongst other stuff and i consider myself not only very smart but funny and at least average looking
my life is going good i'm soon going for a course to improve my career, been doing poetry, working on some other projects as i manage to (somewhat procrastinator here) etc etc
and yet women don't seem to give value to people like me, hell if i care now because i pay hookers to have sex and i spare myself all the bullshit drama of love ajd such
BUT
for guys who still believe in love...
THEY ARE COMPLETELY SCREWED
no girl is ever gonna treat you like a prince you are, quite the contrary, they expected you to do that shit.
it's like we have to be perfect but women only focus on the outside, they are still bitchy all the way, like the world owns them something, like the post above if we demonstrate our appreciation for them we are likely kicked off the place for harassment.
But the moment they see riches or hot guys you can beat them to almost death they'd be okay with it.
that's why i no longer believe in unconditional love, that's in the movies, women can suck at life and will be loved, us? we have to fucking earn it, if we don't have a job it's like we're peasents
so there's no such thing as love in the primitve mind of some women, only money/power and good looks, yeah the so called survival of the fittest... i hoped there would be someone who actually surpassed such thing but those girls actually worth it? they're taken bruh taken even before they reach 18, what's left for us? nothing worth our damn time
so? better to work for riches as i've said, you can be lonely if you work your ass off but at least you cry your ass off in a mansion while you could be crying in a dumpster because you bought your to-be gf a diamond ring... you think you feel sorry for me? you have no ideia how sorry i feel for SIMPS... those are the true poor bastards who think they'll succeed by doing the exact same thing over and over and expected things to be different to some pretty but hollow faces. and what happens next? that kind of people after so much peasentry think they're actually queens and roll over the other men as if canon fodder, well... 
not me 
not anytime soon i'm afraid
again, tips for happy life
1- work your ass off for money while avoiding bitchy atitudes 
2- get paid and cry over your pile of gold
3- pay hookers for easy good chemicals
4-???
5- profit üòÜ"
"no no üòÜüòÜ it was the only thing i remembered üòÜ i normally used another name but it was used already so i had to come up with another one and... oops pls speak your mind

"That is a lack of maturity. And you're better off avoiding someone who has trouble saying how they feel.

Girls may be more likely to have this issue bc they are socialized to never hurt someone's feelings. She may have not realized it's not rude to say ""no"" but it is rude to ghost. I'm not defending her, just offering an explanation. And obviously, it has nothing to do with you. It's her.

In the future, if a day passes, you could ""withdraw"" the offer, so you're not in no man's land and you take back control. You could write: ""You haven't responded, so I'll take that as that you're not interested. No worries _____"" Here you could sting a little by adding, ""plenty of fish"" or ""wasn't sure it was a good idea myself"" or ""prob for the best"", or ""I'm probably too busy"", etc 

And good for you for putting yourself out there."
Totally feel that. Just had it happen to me too, and I thought we hit it off quite good too. We were talking for a solid two weeks and went on a couple of dates and he just...stopped responding. How hard is it to say ‚Äúhey, sorry but I‚Äôm not interested.‚Äù I‚Äôd rather receive a solid no thanks than being ghosted.
"Ok so I'm assuming you've struck out more than 3 times. If not fuck me your going to have a long road Infront of you.

This is from my own personal experience. And applying to people I didn't have an irl relationship with. Online dating and randoms you meet out. When I was younger I tried to be more a friend. And I found myself either friend zoned or ghosted. At some point I stopped trying to be a friend and actually flirted, making my intentions clear. Did I get ghosted still yeah but alot less.

I think the ghosting was partly my fault. I think I'd given an impression I'd be cut up over a shut down.

I want to say at no point was I a nice guy/incel I just had no ideas what I was doing. 

Yes there are millions of reasons people ghost. But it doesn't hurt to ask yourself. Am I causing this?"
Sad to hear you lost real friendships over this. Gladly I have not because I try my best and be there whenever my friends actually need me. I'm just talking about mindless small talks that I've ignored. I haven't lost any real relationships over that because the real people in my life gets me even if I don't keep up with small talks. They **know** that doesn't mean I'm losing interest in them and I'm immensely grateful for those few people
That makes sense. Every one of those girls was borderline insufferable, so IMHO I‚Äôd bank on you being cooler. Or maybe I‚Äôm not cool enough either. Idk.
yeah - it's one thing to not respond to something important/time sensitive but people who think someone is rude just for not continuing a kinda mindless small-talk conversation...meh.
"This reminds me of a ""friend"" who responds to texts within 30 seconds to 30 days, depending on whether she's seeing someone."
If you ask someone out I guarantee you that they understand it‚Äôs important to you, even if they don‚Äôt care. If they even slightly know you then it‚Äôs pretty disrespectful for them to not at least say no. But either way they aren‚Äôt worth your time anyway
The context of this thread though is that the person you sent the message to had an iOS read receipt on the text that was sent, so you would know that they saw the message already and decided not to respond.
"I'm not saying all women check their phone every 5 seconds. I'm saying if you find that when you message a gal she does not respond very quickly to you then theres a reason for it.

Yes, she might sometimes not see your message right away. Dont freak out when you dont get an instant response.

But if you consistently dont get a response in any sort of timely fashion, that's a sign. Trust me, your friend with 13 random snapchatters hitting her up is responding quickly to somebody. She sees a notification on her phone showing who just snapped her, and she isnt opening the ones she doesnt really care about. When the right guy snaps her she will open it and respond."
I chose the wrong word but she is conditioning you to comply with her and engraining fear in you if you do not.  It is something to worry about if she pretends to be mad then forgets about it.  At the very least she is a bad communicator.
I view it as an investment. You buy the $30 toothbrush but then for the next 5-10 years you just buy the cheap replacement brush heads. I also think it helps with dental hygiene, which I assume will save me a ton of money or painful procedures in the future. Dental care in the US is very expensive.
I got one last year after my dentist suggested it, and I can say it's been worth the money. Teeth feel and look noticeably cleaner, and I don't have tartar buildup on the back of my teeth like I used to. I'd say it's a good investment for your dental health in the long run.
Well the most expensive part is the replacement brushes that are ~$7 each. Here I‚Äôm the US manual toothbrushes are only $1-$4.
They are totally worth it. Well not the ones that are around $50. They are just priced so bc they don't use batteries and maybe are waterproof like trimmers. I use the Colgate electric one. The first time I used it, my teeth felt for the first time as if they'd been brushed properly. Never felt cleaner. Brush costed me Rs.500 ($7) or something. I change the brush heads every 3 months and they're pretty cheap too($2.4 for a pack of 2). There's also a better one which has a 2 min timer.
Worth it. First time I used it it felt like I'm at dentist with all that vibrating, but man, it feels nice. Teeth are so smooth after brushing. I also apparently had some problem with my gums(dentist told me that) and electric brush fixed it. It may cost more but it's totally worth it.
"100% worth it. My teeth have never been in such good shape. I used a manual toothbrush and brushed for like 20 seconds because it FELT like 2 minutes lol. Now, I know I‚Äôm brushing for 2 minutes because it won‚Äôt turn off until I have. 

Plus, it‚Äôs much better at getting all the spaces and crevasses that I always missed."
"I have an electric (oral-b) but honestly it doesn't feel like it cleans that good, and if you put too much pressure on it'll stop spinning*. I switched back to the manual.

The new heads for them also cost like ¬£12 a pack which is super expensive for what they are honestly. Considering you can buy the entire toothbrush for that price when they're on offer/discount...

*I know too much pressure isn't good for your teeth/gums, the amount of pressure I'm using is not actually a lot; the electric toothbrush just stops very easily."
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre worth it. My manual toothbrush is about $2. It gets the job done. I‚Äôve seen ads for electric toothbrushes that are over $100 and I think anyone who buys them must be insane.
"They are very worth it. They can accomplish in 2-minutes what 5-10 of brushing can do as it will cover more surface area, faster and more effectively.  
  
Depending on the study read, electric toothbrushes generally reduce plaque by 20-30% and gingivitis by 10-15% more than when a manual toothbrush was used."
I may be an outlier but I have never had a cavity or any dental issues from not brushing correctly. I only use the most basic, stiff bristled, hotel style tooth brush. The key is to be thorough. Brush with pea sized amount of paste then spit and rinse with water. Brush again with only water, rinse and spit. Do this 1-3 times until you barely taste toothpaste. Use your tongue to feel for any leftovers. Brush with water again and rinse until happy.
You could brush once a week and still not get cavities that‚Äôs how much better a job the electric ones do. I paid 30 for mine and it‚Äôs lasted almost five years now.
I was building a lot of calculus(tartar). Dentist cleaning every 6 months and by month 6 I had a pretty significant amount. Bought an electric brush in January, and I‚Äôm on month 9 without going to the dentist, pandemic and shit. I probably have 5% of what I had after 6 months. So they work. Like really work
I've been using one for almost twenty years. I love it. I just returned from a  short vacation where I used a manual and I hated it. I'll never go back.
"Honestly, the only time within the last 5 years I ever recall having to put food back in the microwave was when I was having dental issues.  My husband bought some peroshkis thinking they'd be soft enough for me to eat. He microwaved them to the badly translated instruction on the package that clearly didn't give them enough cook time or account for even cooking. I wasn't even the one that did the initial cooking but when I got to the nearly frozen center, I immediately put them back in.

Before that, the only other issues I recall having is when our old microwave was on the last of its live and not cooking things properly or evenly. Replaced it and have never had issues since.

Edit: typos/autocorrect"
"Well, sure. Everyone is different, just like my body was a dice roll as well. Dicks have difficulty too. Especially as we get older and there's so much pressure. So much pressure on staying hard or you're not man enough, or being big enough, the pervasiveness throughout our society

Which aspect are you referring to? Vaginismus or some affliction?

Also I meant that dating would be statistically much more likely and easier assuming a few factors. Guys have it extremely difficult. A shy guy is not likely to have a whole lot of successes, doubly so if you have anxiety or aren't confident. Because of sexism and how our culture is filled with it

Then there's online dating which is heavily (and I can't emphasize that enough), skewed towards the woman advantage

That's not to say there aren't other problems. But these are the problems that affect me the most directly, I could deal with the other ones, assuming a different life"
I know right :( I have medication now to make them less painful but before that I couldn‚Äôt even stand up >~<
Hmmm everyone has limits though. People do crazy things for love. Sometimes all it takes is that one extra factor to give them a push
"I like it but its not in my top 5.... top 10-20 for sure tho. 1st: its Brian Cranston putting on one hell of a performance (as well as Aaron Paul). 
2nd: its not like most TV shows, for various reasons. Personally, I love the very dour and Sombre setting and plot.... it's like almost as if they have a camera a lens called ""melancholy"" and they used it for the entire show.
3rd: the story itself is very well thought out and written.
4th: I dont like Skylar at all, in fact I hate her character and her arc.... but I think that's kinda the point; so even when I don't like an aspect of the show, I feel as if that was the intention and I appreciate it.

That's my unranked review for ya!"
Lol so in all seriousness, this is what I was going for. And I agree with your rebuttal, though I think its a bit too low hanging of fruit... which does make it stupider!
"Beats the outcome that happened, doesn't it? I dont think he would wanna fuck her anyway, btw... nothing is worse than a dead fish in the bed! He was prolly happy she didn't actually fuck him and just did the handy instead cuz the sex would have been awful! All of this to say: I'm pretty sure his ego would get an owie either way. 

I'll not back down: Skylar's lack of prowess in the bedroom (coupled with her being a complete bitch) is what caused the breaking bad storyline to happen."
No, making himself feel important was more important to him. If it was about the money, he would have taken that job at Gray Matter. Walt admits to Skylar that he did it for himself in the last episode.
Yes, but only cuz he knew that the amount of effort she put into handys would correlate with the amount of effort she would put into remembering him after he died. Money might change that.
"Maybe, but maybe she's just paranoid about it. 

I used to get like that a lot when I was in my early 20s, and I adamantly did not and still do not want kids. But my body would be acting ""strange"" and my brain would go straight to ""Pregnant!!! Take a test!!!!"" Luckily I did not usually indulge this urge, I would just wait a few days and then my period would come. But, the one time I did take the test the waiting period felt like an eternity."
oh god not always. I've always been terrified of being pregnant and never wanted kids and would sometimes get extremely freaked out that I was, just absolutely convince myself of it.  Thank god I never was...
The only one of those things I don‚Äôt do is scuba dive. I meant more going out and partying whenever you want. Best part, I can do all of that stuff with my kid. He is so amazed at the simplest stuff, and I get to be proud of him when he follows in my footsteps. I am not trying to be rude or condescending, kids just make your life better. You have to have a good partner and you have to do a good job. It just like those other hobbies, you have to put the time in to get good results. If you do though, you will always have someone to do your hobbies with. I can‚Äôt express enough how hollow life seems to have been before having a kid. Make your choice, but I am telling you your missing out on the best part.
12 years ago mine decided to go imbed itself far into the uterus where a baby goes and I have to have it surgically replaced.....I am dreading it but my dr told me recently they can lose their effectiveness after this long so now I'm paranoid AF!
"I think for the hip your head would be outside the tube. My knee MRI my whole head and torso was outside the tube. 

I'd recommend asking about an open MRI. They're supposed to be less clear of an image, but for severe claustrophobia it has to be worth a shot. 

The middle of the tube is where the imaging happens. For my wrist MRI, I had my arm over my head like superman, which is why my head was in the tube."
"I've never figured out the rationale for how deep they need you in the tube for an MRI. My first one, many years ago, was for my knee and I was inside the tube up to my waist. (My head was so far away, I heard almost none of the legendary noises.) As u/AineDez points out, the middle of the tube is where they take the pictures, so you can expect to be placed further in than your injury; but I can't imagine they'd need your head, or entire chest, inside.

Talk to your doctor about the anxiety, and also talk to the tech who does the actual scan. They're (obviously) accustomed to nervous patients. I asked at my recent failed attempt how many people freak out; he told me the previous 2 patients both had. I would've thought repeated exposure to the same sort of failed attempts would harden someone, but he was comforting and empathetic."
If it comes to it, there's an open MRI type available.  I had to have one, I couldn't stand being in the closed tube, even with anxiety meds.  The new one is almost as good as the closed one (check to see what type of open MRI equipment they're using) and I actually fell asleep during the MRI.  I was told that happens quite a bit.
"Oh shit why didn‚Äôt I think of that! You‚Äôre so smart thank you for solving my problem.

You have absolutely no idea what it‚Äôs like or what goes on in there, what kind of situations come up and how they have to be dealt with.

But thanks for the criticism of how I do my job when no one else will and doing the best I can, appreciated"
"So true!  I hated the pain, but this thing allows me to lead a very active lifestyle and not have to worry about periods or babies.  I exercise a lot, and I was in a sport where I needed to be in a weight class, and not bloating each month is super helpful for when I need to compete.

I remember being terrified and reading horror stories about how it hurt, or how it fell out, but in the end, this has worked beautifully for me, and I recommend to my girlfriends that they should bring it up with their doctors if they are searching for a new kind of BC.  I didn't like having to take the pill (I couldn't figure out a consistent time to take it, and I was living alone but staying with a partner a few times a week, so I always had to have it on me, and remembering to bring it was a pain), and it gave me a lot of weird mental and physical issues that I didn't want."
Don't let the pain scare you. Bodies are wonderfully resilient. It hurts, yes, but it is a great method of birth control. No having to remember to take a pill or deal with a ring, and for me and many others, very negligible side effects. As with many things, the momentary hurt is worth the relief on the other side. Happy to answer any questions if you feel like asking üôÇ
Fairly light (light for me at least), but it felt like a lot because it just never stopped. I definitely needed to wear a tampon, it wasn‚Äôt light enough to go without.
"A lot of it was because of my issues with medicine in general. I had been put on a certain medication for years with the promise that it worked and it never did, no matter how many I took (long story, but it was antidepressants that just didn't work for me and I was too naive to do anything about it for a few years).

So the idea that an implant in my arm was supposed to work on my uterus just didn't make sense to me. I also have a huge problem with needles so it was a hard nope for me lol. I'm not saying I don't think they don't work, I just know that if I went that route I would be constantly worried about it failing and not being able to do anything about it. It was the same with the pills, but I blame the failed antidepressants on those as well lol.

For me mirena was the one that made me the most comfortable both physically and mentally"
I gained a ton of weight on the implant, period was whack and constant spotting and pain. Would not recommend personally.
I was advised to get an IUD over the implant due to the hormone amounts and effects on my body (aka my blood pressure). I don‚Äôt know how it is yet. My appointment is Tuesday, so I guess I‚Äôll see shortly.
"I‚Äôve had the implant. If you choose to try it, ask the doctor for a pack of pills (can‚Äôt remember if it‚Äôs a pack or one big one) of the same hormone in the implant, because it is not the same as in most pills.

I had tried a BUNCH of different pills by that point, like switching brands 1-2 times a  year for 8 years, because insurance etc. Some were better than others but mostly same same. The implant screwed with my mood and libido and my period never fully settled. I read a lot of forums about it taking a long time to get used to so I waited.

A long time later, I mentioned something offhandedly to my sister. She works in a clinic, was much better versed in these things than me. Asked about the trial pills and was super pissed they hadn‚Äôt even mentioned them to me. Her body also reacted horribly to the Nexplannon.

I got it out. That dr was also annoyed that the original doctor hadn‚Äôt mentioned anything about them being different. 

Overall: great idea, poor execution for me."

I am doing pretty well.  I am glad to hear that good news!  I have gone through rough patches in my life and know how hard it is just to get through some days.  Be well my friend, I do think of you.
"It‚Äôs a matter of semantics there, because I don‚Äôt disagree with you: I think if your motivations are other than being a actual friend then it‚Äôs not really a friendzone, it‚Äôs just one interested party and one not.

It‚Äôs natural to want to act on attraction but I think there‚Äôs nothing wrong with just being a friend‚Äîif someone doesn‚Äôt desire me that doesn‚Äôt make the relationship have to end or without merit, it just has to change. It‚Äôs a matter of connection to my own motivations and whether I can kind of zen-out that reptile part of my brain that might subconsciously turn someone else off. 

Saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just be friends‚Äù is often another way to try and let someone down without provoking a response, but I think trying that out isn‚Äôt all bad‚Äîwomen become less confusing the more time you spend with them in any capacity. Friends teach you things. At the least you could get some insight into whether they do actually want that or are letting you down easy and maybe why either way‚ÄîI never knew I used to be a creep until someone trusted me enough to tell me outright, haha, but I had to earn that trust legitimately.

Sometimes friendships change that direction too, if allowed to happen naturally, like if a friend relationship helps a person grow as a person they become more confident and desirable. Women make great ‚Äúwingmen,‚Äù can give an outside perspective with advice and it helps to develop that empathy that will be needed later in a different relationship. Women are great! For me it‚Äôs often a richer friendship because I never feel like there‚Äôs a subconscious competition like I feel from a lot of dudes.

I agree that maintaining a relationship based on ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù is toxic; it‚Äôs soul poison to pine for something and it‚Äôs immature and creepy to fake it. 

That‚Äôs what I think of when I hear people toss around the friendzone term. Many if not most people who use that phrase are just liars using fake friendship like it‚Äôs some sex token that they are owed. 

But yeah, I get your point! Thanks for talking"
"Ok, the way I see it, if thing 1 is less desirable than thing 2, you need more of it, if you're wanna trade.  All things being the same, adding risk or negative consequences to an action makes it less desirable.  So if entering a relationship has more negative consequences for women, then the thing men are offering is less desirable.  This means they have to offer more in the transaction in order to make it worthwhile.

Also, society playing out this way is not all good for women either.  Many men will outright reject a woman, if the woman is the one pursuing.  This causes more work for them.  They now have to catch the attention of the man and make them pursue, without the man being aware that they are in fact being chased after themselves.  It happens more often than you think.  If you ask a couple how they met, you will often hear the women had been trying to get the man's attention for days, weeks, or even years, before they got asked out.  That's just one example.  There's plenty of other ways this imbalance is bad for women, but I already wrote a wall of text."
"The first part of what you said makes a lot of sense, but including the ""plenty of fish"" bit (or anything similar to that) there would just come across as petty


Y' know, the whole The Fox and the Grapes thing"
Or, considering we don't know her or the OP, she could be perfectly mature and knows he's a douche. Or she could have had that experience in the oast where you decline and get abuse. Or she could have died. Or or or....
I appreciate this thoughtful response, thank you. It's been a discouraging couple of months, I know that's not unique to me but I was kind of thinking of taking a break from the dating game for a while. After reading this I think I'll give it another shot and try that out where if they ghost me I message them again, kind of calling them out. It's not like it would put me in a worse situation if I do it right. Anyways thanks, that was a good pick me up. You deserved an award.
So true. I'm sorry you share that pain. It's a weird feeling, it's different than heartache. It's just a sad confusion. All I can do to prevent that from spreading in our culture is to never do it, myself, and raise awareness that it's sort of a rude thing to do.
"I'm actually really open to that but I'm not sure how to tell what it is I'm doing that causes them to ghost ?

And yeah I've struck out plenty, I was just referring to the recent couple of months"
"Just do like my brother and simply respond ""lol"" to whatever I say. That's my cue that he's lost interest."
"> Dental care in the US is very expensive.

$650 cleaning last week in a non-competitive time slot. Coronavirus PPE fees are ****ing ridiculous."
"I got the high end Oral-B/Braun electric brush when I got braces 7 or so years ago. It came with a wall mount charger and several brush modes. I would have never bought it myself ($120 new) but it just came with the braces. 

Anyway, the braces are long gone but the brush is still going strong. I‚Äôve replaced the brush head a few times, and now the battery won‚Äôt hold a a charge, but this doesn‚Äôt matter because it can just be left on the charger. Haven‚Äôt had a single cavity since getting the braces off! I‚Äôm definitely gonna buy another if this one ever quits on me!"
my dentist said my oral hygiene was spectacular after about six months of a quip toothbrush. even asked if i had started flossing (i hadnt‚Äîim horrible i know). i just brush like i used to with a manual brush but apparently its like noticeably better.
"That‚Äôs odd to me - perhaps you just got a dud brush.

I have the oral b pro 3000 for years now - even if I push it hard to my teeth - the red light flashes but the brush head still just keeps a rotating ya pretty much same speed - certainly no stopping.

I‚Äôd have to apply a lot of pressure to stop it rotating.

Not doubting your experience- but either your brush is a dud cause it stopped too easily - or mines a dud cause it keeps powering through !"
The rotating brushes are not worth it. The sonic ones are what you should get. I had the Oral b for years until it gave out and I thought My teeth couldn‚Äôt get any cleaner. Then I get the Philips sonicare and holly guacamole, the feeling of clean teeth is on another level.
Fell for the marketing and bought one of the ~100$ one, with Bluetooth and RGB leds. Can confirm it's a complete waste of money. On the other hand electric vs manual makes a world of a difference on how clean your teeth feel (and are, according to the dentist doing my checkups).
I bought a $30 one about a year ago and I feel it was totally worth it. It cleans your teeth way better and science backs that up. I'd recommend you give it a try. It isn't that much money and your teeth are important.
"I believe it just has to do with the individual's oral health. 

Some people could never brush and not get cavities and others need constant care or it all goes south."
$100 lol that's too much and I have been to a dentist once in my life and she said my teeth are perfectly fine and good. Nothing requires any change. Thanks I think I got my answer. Will spend money somewhere else now
Alcohol is just bad news man for weight loss but balance is key and everyone enjoys their own things. Drinking too much alcohol is bad for different reasons than eating too many cheeseburgers. One common trait is that they‚Äôll both get you fat. Anybody would tell a cheeseburger lover that they can occasionally treat themselves, so I‚Äôll tell you that you should occasionally enjoy a beer. (Assuming you want to lose weight)
You did a good job of fleshing out an infuriating argument and (most importantly) committing to the bit. Very solid work throughout the thread.
There were other factors in his life that made him feel powerless and that this was his only recourse. You should absolutely back down because if this is your attitude toward sex you have likely inflicted a decent amount of trauma on past sexual partners, if by some miracle you‚Äôve been able to have any.
Yea, that's how it is BEFORE you've had a child. She already has one, has a relationship with someone else, and wants to cement it. It's not paranoia, it's broodiness.
How do you have the time and money for that PLUS a kid? Between a full time job and an SO I still feel like I don‚Äôt have enough time for myself, and financially a kid would drain a lot of my income.
I, too, could never figure out the rationale. I appreciate your comments and I hope I have most of my upper body out of the tube.  Or, they knock me out. I had a friend who would go in for MRI‚Äôs on a monthly basis and would be fully in the tube. She said she looked forward to it, because it was so peaceful and tranquil laying in that tube. Not sure why some have this fear and others don‚Äôt.
That‚Äôs good to know, and thank you for the info.  Sounds like I am not alone when it comes to claustrophobia.
No problem man. I know if I worked at a vet, I would give way more of a shit about the actual lives of the pets then the actual customers in the lobby. Don‚Äôt really see how it‚Äôs any more complex than that. If an animal is in a possible life or death situation if you aren‚Äôt able to help, then ignore the customers and fuck what the customer thinks about it
Thanks!! It‚Äôs actually been 7 months. Scars are barely noticeable and zero regrets! I‚Äôm so thankful I was able to have it done.
"Did you know you can read something on the internet you don't agree with and carry on with your life?

also it's not hatred for all women it's disregard for MOST women's hipocrisy i do know women who actually do their part and take the 1st step, but again thank you"
"BEFORE THEY GOT ASKED OUT, that's why we are the ones who have the balls, if they have interest fucking show it. 
Most of the time women don't get their message across because it isn't a message it's an hieroglyph we are supposed to get, be direct in your approach, if they get the same treatment as we men get oops that's life for you, if the guy is rude well in that case only i'll defend the woman's side cause that's not the way to treat someone who' s trying her hardest."
We only know his side, so we go with it. There's no reason to doubt him. Kinda like innocent untill proven guilty?

Thank you so much. I'm glad you're not giving up. 

When I get ghosted or rejected, I try not to take it personally. I think, maybe the person just broke up with someone and is not over them, or they're going through a hard time, or they're really pining for someone who may not be interested, or they're in a relationship but need some affirmation or they're extremely shy. 

Maybe I'm just making myself feel better, but no one is better than me and I'm not better than anyone else. We're just at different points on our paths in life sometimes. And sometimes our paths cross and sometimes they don't.

So it's never about you, because someone who has known you for a few texts and sees your picture, or has gone on a few dates with you, has not seen all the gems you have inside, or all that you have been through, all the things that make you be the only you on earth."
It‚Äôs definitely a weird feeling, specially when you thought you hit it off.  But no worries dude, I‚Äôm sure the right person for you will come along!
"Idk you so I'm not going to Hazzard any guesses. All I can say if you have any exs who you think would be open to talk about your faults in a constructive manner hit them up.

Other than. You gotta start asking yourself the big questions and decided if even you'd hang out with you."
Are your teeth made of gold and require special cleaning?! If you honestly paid that for just a cleaning you got bent over and not in a good way
My GF's does the same. Both different models (not sure which off-hand though). It's meant so you don't apply too much pressure as I mentioned already, but... I dunno, it's too light on ours at least. Maybe it's because they're a bit older now. Maybe it could be the heads on them. Not sure if they're cheapo heads. I'll have to get some new ones to try at some point.
Eh, if you floss and brush regularly then a manual toothbrush is totally sufficient. I've never had a cavity my entire life and my semi-annual dentist visit is literally my dentist lavishing my teeth with praise for 15 minutes.
Sorry! Lol. Edited the comment. Using a new keyboard setting on my phone which apparently created a lot of weird typos/autocorrects.
"No, I don't think so either. But it's just a TV show, and ""deserve"" is such a ephemeral word in that context"
Lol now I'm not sure if you are serious but thanks! I really did commit and I almost started convincing myself even haha. Just out here trying to have a good time :)
Lol nah see, my very first comment was meant as a light hearted riff that people do in real life when conversing but then of course y'all come around thinking I'm being dead serious, and that everything on the internet is black and white, and so now I'm just fucking around and writing the things that I wouldn't even THINK of had you not come here to be some fucken paragon or something. Shit is so fucken stupid, but you do you. Just take solace in the fact that I live in my moms basement yadda yadda... lol... so fuken dumb you are.
Oh shit, ya I guess I didn't think about those things! I should try to use hyperbole once in awhile instead of always saying exactly what I mean all the time!! Thanks.
Well, to be frank, I have a penis so much of the child rearing at a young age doesn‚Äôt fall on me. ü§∑üèªBefore anyone gets mad, kids just want their mom a lot of the time. Teaching your kid to entertain themselves goes a long way. As for money, be smart. You have to get your shit in order. Get a mortgage on a reasonable house, and stop paying rent. Don‚Äôt eat out to often. Learn to fix stuff yourself. On top of that, look towards a higher paying job. Kids do cost money, but it‚Äôs worth it. I gave up smoking weed and drinking for something that every time I think of it I am happy. You do lose time, money, sleep and sex. Hell, you even lose friends. But you realize those friends weren‚Äôt the best, you didn‚Äôt need the money, and this is a better use of your time. The sex loss is rough though. Biggest fucking cock block in the world is a kid. I can‚Äôt wait for my son to be a teen trying to get his dick wet so I can get my revenge!
Dr's have tried at least 3 times getting it and they can't. It's like going in there to get a baby out so traditional means are not going to cut it. I think my original OB cut the string too short and it just kept going...
"Your advice is absolutely worthless

You don‚Äôt work in my field and you‚Äôve never seen my office or how it works so why would I listen to anything you say? Because you‚Äôre some random shmuck I met on Reddit who thinks they know what‚Äôs best? üòÇ

Back to the original topic - take your change and get the fuck out of the way. Some people have shit to attend to."
"I'm not a medical professional, so I don't feel qualified to speak to the ""best one.""  I have the Mirena, and it works wonderfully for me, and thousands of others, but it is not the best for everybody.  You should talk to your medical provider and discuss what might work for you.

An IUD is a small, T-shaped piece of plastic that is inserted into your uterus through the vagina.  It goes in your uterus behind your cervix, so you don't have to try to hold it there, and you won't feel it at all.  It has two little strings that come through the opening in your cervix, which you can't feel unless you're looking for them.  You can feel them with your fingers, and they are used to help ensure proper placement-- I check on mine once every few months, but I can't feel it and my partner has never complained that he can feel it either.

Mirena is a hormonal birth control, and releases a small amount of progestin, which thickens the mucus of the cervix to stop a sperm from getting to an egg.  It also thins the lining of the uterus, which is why it can help with heavy periods, and many women have no period at all on Mirena.  There are other IUDs, mainly a copper one, that makes the uterus inhospitable to sperm so that they die rather than fertilize an egg.  Lots of women like the copper IUD because it is hormone free, but it does not have the same benefits of lightening periods.  Again, talk to your doc about why you want an IUD, and I'm sure they will be able to help pick one that works for you.  As many women are saying, insertion hurts, but it is well worth the pain to not have to worry about accidental pregnancy or difficult periods.

Does that help?"
"The reason having balls is a saying is because more testosterone makes you more aggressive and take more risks.  More testosterone is what men have, which also makes them more equipped for the job of doing the asking.  But even women with higher rates of testosterone cannot be direct, because women who are too direct, are not seen as desirable by some men.

Also, there is a much higher occurrence of testosterone in the prison population compared to everyone else.  Women don't get treated the same way because they are inherintly less aggressive.  

That same aggressiveness is what makes men more dangerous.  The mixed signals are a defense mechanism.  If they find out the man they are pursuing is dangerous, they can disengage easier, without angering him for ""leading them on"".  They need the benefit of the doubt to not anger the the more aggressive and possibly dangerous men.  A bad date for a woman can lead to being raped, beaten, or killed. 

There are definitely cases where a misunderstanding can lead to allegations that put men in jail, or ostracized from their friend group, but that happens considerably less than the amount of times a date leads to violence against the woman."
"In summary, a fox tries to get some grapes from a vine, but they were too high


After trying for a while, the fox gives up on them, but instead of admitting its poor climbing skills, it just went like ""Well, I didn't even want those grapes anyway lol"""
That's a really good perspective. It doesn't help to take it personally. I just gotta stay on my path and see who it crosses with.
The spinning brush is just that, spinning. But the sonic is vibrating bristles. They are usually the same shape as regular brushes and you can barely see the vibrations but they work much better at dislodging new plaque and residues from the teeth. Plus they are gentler on the gums.
That sounds nice, now I've got this image of a dentist showering someone with rose petals! I'm not saying you *need* an electric brush, just that, if you can afford it, a cheap one (and they also go for ~20‚Ç¨) is worth it.
Was planning on going to sleep. But this blew up. Now busy in reaching all those people who are wishing me.
"> You do lose time, money, sleep and sex.

Yeah, any less than the amount I have now is a no-go, and I already busted my ass hard enough to get tenure I am not busting my ass again to find a ""better paying job"" just to get smacked by a ""once in a lifetime recession"" for the third fucking time.

Not to mention my genetic issues might get passed down to the kid, and I don't want him taking 18 pills a day and getting yearly colonoscopies. Or dealing with the famine and wars that will come with global warming."
You‚Äôre really getting riled up over Reddit man, you seem unstable. My sister is a vet tech and I‚Äôm sure if I asked her or any other vet, they‚Äôd agree they wouldn‚Äôt ever dare go near a register if there was a chance that it meant that an animal in the backs life is at stake where a minute makes the difference. That‚Äôs so shitty
"humm and learning to defend themselves is not an option? ah funny... just go check Victorian body builders and see how strong women could be back then, but yes understandable they choose not to learn martial arts, placing their life at risk like anti vax, but again, not my problem. 
yet the same men that beat/etc women out because of a ""lead on"" would become aggressive any other time so that doesn't make much of sense and they should be dealt with swiftly, i find that behavior primitive in men, unacceptable nowadays, while i resent women lack of atitude if i saw somebody being raped i'd kill the guy at the 1st instant possible, granted i was sure it was rape of course. 
again by some men, what about shy men? what about men who are passive? I for instance would love a girl approaching me..."
"The other thing I suggest is get all your shit before seriously dating anyway. Holes have long distracted men from their goals.

As in have your mental health in a good place. Your work sorted. Your finances in line. And any other shit that should be more important than pussy. Things don't have to be perfect but you need to be on the perfection path."
Well that does sound like you have some genetic issues... however, as for famine, wars and global warming, our ancestors raised their kids in caves. They had to fend off wolves with sharpened sticks. I think our kids got it pretty sweet!
"You‚Äôre the type who thinks someone commenting means they‚Äôre riled up? And that it somehow lends support to your argument that I‚Äôm bad at my job?

‚ÄúHa you‚Äôre so mad right now!‚Äù

Like, what does it matter how someone else is feeling and why do you feel the need to tell someone they‚Äôre mad, over reading comments on Reddit? I seriously don‚Äôt understand, does it make you feel better or like you‚Äôve won or something? What‚Äôs the point"
Wonderful :)  Happy to share my experience.  Definitely do bring it up with a healthcare provider-- they will be able to offer more insight into your available selection, but the process of insertion is the same across the board.  Good luck!
"The average man can and have beaten professional female athletes at their own sports.  The average 197 lb American man can very easily overpower 99% of the female population.  Even trained mma fighters can't do much, since female bodies naturally produce less muscle...way less muscle.

The time commitment required to be of any real use makes that less useful than just learning how to disengage.  I would equate it to working with a large animal.  It's probably easier to find ways to calm the animal down, than it would be to get stronger the animal.  They could also use a tranquilizer gun or mace, which incidentally women also carry, sometimes, in case the other methods don't work.  

Most women have been taught many many different ways of dealing with the dangers of dating.  They don't accept drinks from people they don't trust or straight from bartenders, very rarely go out without a group or man they trust, always have at least one person know where they are and have them check on them regularly.  A lot of bars even have signs in the women's bathroom telling them which ""drink"" to order that will tip off the bartender that they are in trouble and need help.  That's just a few off the top of my head.

What I'm saying is they already do a lot of things to deal with the threat that men can possibly pose.  They're not just passively getting attacked, hoping society makes men more passive.  It's something they prepare for on a daily basis.

I agree with you that the type of person to do something like that probably gets aggressive over things other than being lead on, but until they do something bad enough to warrant being put away or sent to get the help they need, they are still out in the world.  And if they haven't been caught, it might be hard to gauge how aggressive they are until it happens.  Even if it's only 1% of the population, that presents a fairly high risk of bodily or mental injury, considering how many people the average person meets."
Thank you for the follow up, that is so sweet.  I have the ‚Äúmake apt to get a shot‚Äù on my to-do list and keep ignoring it.  You have given me the nudge just to make the apt and get it over with.

Apt 10/8 at 2:00. They will need some sort of imaging in order to locate the inflamed area. From everyone I have talked with, who had cortisone shots, they needed to have MRI‚Äôs. We shall keep a positive mind and hope for the best. :)
No man I was just legitimately telling you to chill out cause you‚Äôre cursing and sounding angry over the discussion. I never put a lol or laughed or nothing like I‚Äôm trying to rile someone up. I just legitimately don‚Äôt understand why you would care about the register at a time when an animals life is possibly at stake.
"understandable yes learning how to avoid is better or habing pepper spray or some sort. 

yet that is the average man of nearly 200lb i'm talking Europe not bison looking people üòÜ (sorry, i deserve the hate here) i've seen man of all types and definitely man way smaller than women ah! another funny thing! if women so much fear men why they most feel attracted to taller men who can easily outpower them?
not stupid at all right?"
